# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 9
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo)
*  Last week, Rachel reported that in addition to all these efforts to get federal agencies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=0.0s)]
*  to seize voting machines, when President Trump invited delegations of Republican state lawmakers [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=4.78s)]
*  from Michigan and Pennsylvania to the White House a couple of weeks after the election, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=9.9s)]
*  he also talked to them about seizing the voting machines in their states. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=14.72s)]
*  That's according to new reporting from the New York Times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=20.2s)]
*  And on November 20th, the very same day Trump was meeting with Republicans at the White [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=23.64s)]
*  House from Michigan, a lawyer for a Michigan County sheriff emailed a Trump lawyer claiming [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=27.88s)]
*  that his local sheriff, this local sheriff, had seized voting machines and ballots. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=35.16s)]
*  The sheriff, by the way, denied to us that he had actually done it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=40.36s)]
*  So now that we know that right on or around that same day, November 20, 2020, Rudy Giuliani [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=43.8s)]
*  asked the local prosecutor in Antrim County, Michigan to please seize the voting machines [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=50.84s)]
*  for the Trump campaign. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=55.6s)]
*  Now from the Washington Post today, quote, in the weeks after the 2020 election, Rudolph [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=58.0s)]
*  W. Giuliani and other legal advisors to President Donald Trump asked a Republican prosecutor [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  in northern Michigan to get his county's voting machines and pass them to Trump's team. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Antrim County prosecutor James Rossiter said in an interview that Giuliani and several [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=77.28s)]
*  colleagues made the request during a telephone call. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=82.2s)]
*  Rossiter said he declined. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  I said, I can't just give them, say, give them here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  We don't have that magical power to just demand things as prosecutors. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  You need probable cause. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=95.0s)]
*  Even if he had sufficient grounds to take the machines as evidence, Rossiter said he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=97.68s)]
*  could not have released them to outsiders or a party with an interest in the matter. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=101.2s)]
*  A legal scholar said it was unusual and inappropriate for a president's representatives to make [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=107.48s)]
*  such a request of a local prosecutor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=113.2s)]
*  I never expected in my life I'd get a call like this, Rossiter said. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=116.72s)]
*  Trump and his allies tried to get the Pentagon to seize the machines. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=123.76s)]
*  Then they tried to get the Justice Department. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  They tried Homeland Security. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=129.96s)]
*  They tried state lawmakers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=131.66s)]
*  They tried a local prosecutor. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=133.44s)]
*  They never got anyone to say yes, but they really, really did try to make it happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=136.28s)]
*  Federal law makes it clear that presidential records are not the property of the individual [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=144.08s)]
*  person who holds the office. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=149.0s)]
*  They are public property. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=151.36s)]
*  They cannot be destroyed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=153.02s)]
*  And now the National Archives is taking the unusual step of asking the Justice Department [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=154.84s)]
*  to investigate whether Trump's handling of official White House records, including classified [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=159.68s)]
*  material, does in fact violate that federal law. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=164.88s)]
*  Now within the past hour we got word from the New York Times about what could have prompted [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=170.0s)]
*  the National Archives to take that step. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=174.18s)]
*  Here's the headline. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=176.92s)]
*  Archives found possible classified material in boxes returned by Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=178.64s)]
*  Quote, the National Archives and Records Administration discovered what it believed was classified [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  information in documents that Donald J. Trump had taken with him from the White House as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=189.24s)]
*  he left office, according to a person briefed on the matter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  The discovery prompted the National Archives to reach out to the Justice Department for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=197.68s)]
*  guidance. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=201.84s)]
*  The person said, the department told the National Archives to have its inspector general examine [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=202.88s)]
*  the matter, but the Times doesn't know what happened next. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=207.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Washington Post, which first reported on the National Archives' referral [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=211.72s)]
*  to the Justice Department, also reports that these discussions between the two agencies [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=216.04000000000002s)]
*  are preliminary. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  It's not yet clear whether the Justice Department will investigate this, but what does it take [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=222.04s)]
*  to decide whether Trump's record-keeping regimen breaks the law? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=226.84s)]
*  Joining us now is Alana Cohen, former associate White House counsel and then general counsel [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=232.08s)]
*  of the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=237.0s)]
*  Ms. Cohen, thank you for being here tonight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  I assume you're well briefed on what you're supposed to and not supposed to do with documents, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=243.4s)]
*  not just for the president, but in these jobs that you've worked in. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=249.88s)]
*  It's pretty clear. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=252.8s)]
*  It's got to be President 101 to realize you can't destroy documents in the White House. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=254.84s)]
*  And yet we've been hearing reports for years that Donald Trump does this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=261.04s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much for having me. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=264.04s)]
*  It's absolutely crystal clear when you enter one of those jobs in the White House about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=266.96s)]
*  what you can and can't do with presidential records and what you can do with your own [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=271.0s)]
*  records. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=275.0s)]
*  I would have never expected anyone among my colleagues to have torn up their records and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=276.56s)]
*  taped them back together or taken them even with them home to their residences. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=284.0s)]
*  There was even talk and reporting about the fact that staff who knew the rules would go [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=290.32s)]
*  in right after Trump, wherever he was, retrieve documents that hadn't been ripped up and take [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=295.78s)]
*  those that had and try and piece them back together, sometimes successfully, sometimes [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=302.76s)]
*  unsuccessfully. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=306.76s)]
*  So it's not that everybody in the White House can claim we didn't know that you're actually [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=307.92s)]
*  supposed to keep this stuff. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=311.92s)]
*  It was obvious that you're supposed to. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=313.42s)]
*  So what's your best guess as to what this habit of ripping things up was about? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=315.12s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll commend those staffers who pieced the documents back together again. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=320.08s)]
*  I mean, that must have been a difficult thing to actually do in light of the fact that their [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=325.8s)]
*  boss deliberately flouted the rules and the law. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=330.52s)]
*  My best guess is that the White House counsel would have repeatedly told the president as well [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=338.24s)]
*  as the staff how important it was to preserve documents and that there's really no excuse then [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=343.32s)]
*  in light of the fact that those warnings would have inevitably gone out and have reportedly gone [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=349.84s)]
*  out as late as, you know, 27, you know, right up until the end of the administration. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=355.48s)]
*  There's no reason really why he would have he would have then taken those documents with him [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  to to Florida. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=368.12s)]
*  There's there'd be no excuse for that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  So let's explain that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  We're packing up the White House to move out. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=373.04s)]
*  Clearly, there's some stuff you brought to the White House that's yours and those go in your [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=375.12s)]
*  personal boxes, I suppose. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=378.48s)]
*  But they literally put aside separate boxes that it had, we believe, the the Sharpie weather thing. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=380.52s)]
*  It may have had a correspondence with Kim Jong Un, a letter from from President Obama and other [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=387.32s)]
*  things that might be classified, stuff that definitely doesn't fall into the category of things [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=394.36s)]
*  I brought with me to the White House, a teddy bear that I really need to have close to me. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=398.56s)]
*  There seemed to be some curation as to the documents that went into the boxes that went to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=403.48s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=408.08s)]
*  Yeah, although I can't say I totally understand what the, you know, picture the map with a Sharpie [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=410.04s)]
*  circle has to do with a letter to, you know, another foreign leader. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=416.52s)]
*  So but the the fact that he took some of those materials with him and in particular, you know, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=421.96s)]
*  letters to foreign leaders is not is is not only problematic from a records perspective, it's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=428.04s)]
*  problematic from a transition perspective. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=435.56s)]
*  You really inhibit the next administration, you know, by taking materials that are important to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  the national security of the United States. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=446.08s)]
*  And correspondence with foreign leaders is of utmost importance when an incoming administration [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=449.12s)]
*  is trying to decide its policy and with respect to, you know, different countries. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=455.8s)]
*  So he not only inhibited future historians from being able to really hold him accountable [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=460.68s)]
*  through his records, he also really inhibited the next administration, which was hampered by not [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=469.04s)]
*  having a full accounting of how he handled certain correspondence, certain communications with other [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=475.12s)]
*  foreign leaders. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=480.6s)]
*  You know, I am curious. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=482.48s)]
*  I saw the reporting that said that the archives recovered 15 boxes of documents, but they didn't [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=484.36s)]
*  report on how many he took. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=491.92s)]
*  And so their questions are actually not only, you know, the documents that he recovered, that they [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=494.36s)]
*  recovered, but during that one year period, whether there were other materials that had a [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=501.84s)]
*  different fate. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=507.84s)]
*  We're now on day 13 of what officials in the Canadian capital of Ottawa are calling an [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=509.52s)]
*  occupation. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=514.24s)]
*  For the past two weeks, hundreds of truckers have been camped out on the streets in their [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=515.48s)]
*  vehicles, bringing the city center of Ottawa to a virtual standstill. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=520.56s)]
*  The truckers calling themselves a freedom convoy originally came to Ottawa to protest a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=524.84s)]
*  requirement that Canadian truck drivers crossing the US border be fully vaccinated. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=530.16s)]
*  But those protests have since escalated. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=535.04s)]
*  They've started spreading beyond the capital. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  We've now entered day three of protesters blocking the busiest crossing in North America, the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=539.36s)]
*  Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario to Detroit. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=545.36s)]
*  About 200 people in vehicles are blocking or snarling traffic on that bridge, which carries 25% [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=549.76s)]
*  of all trade between the US and Canada or an estimated 300 million dollars a day. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  Farther west, protesters in about 50 trucks are blocking the Cootes border crossing, which is the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=562.36s)]
*  busiest port between Alberta, Canada and the state of Montana. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=568.36s)]
*  That crossing typically sees more than 40 million dollars of goods pass through daily. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=572.4s)]
*  And today, protesters blocked yet another transportation artery at the Michigan-Canada border. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=577.76s)]
*  It's important to note that as much chaos as these few hundred truckers and their 18 wheelers are [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=583.36s)]
*  causing, their view on this issue is not popular in Canada at all. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=588.12s)]
*  More than 80% of the Canadian public is vaccinated. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=592.0s)]
*  Almost 90% of Canadian truckers are vaccinated. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=594.6s)]
*  This protest wasn't even organized by the Canadian trucking unions, the largest of which has come out [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=599.28s)]
*  actively against the protests. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=604.04s)]
*  So not only is this a fringe group of Canadians, it's a fringe group even within the small niche of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=606.56s)]
*  Canadian truckers. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=613.04s)]
*  But where this group is popular, this is interesting, where they found an incredibly large platform is [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  right here with American conservatives and American conservative media. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=620.24s)]
*  Their stories become a staple on right-wing outlets like Fox News. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  American conservatives from Glenn Beck to Marjorie Taylor Greene to the former president himself have [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=628.92s)]
*  all championed their cause. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=634.1999999999999s)]
*  It's hard not to miss the Trump flags floating around the world. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=637.3199999999999s)]
*  It's hard not to miss the Trump flags flying among the crowds in Ottawa, also spotted in the crowds, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  Confederate flags, QAnon banners, swastikas, none of which are common sites in Canada. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=648.4799999999999s)]
*  In addition to giving this fringe group one of the world's largest megaphones, this American [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=656.0s)]
*  attention means the protesters have been able to fundraise millions and millions of dollars further [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=660.16s)]
*  amplifying their cause. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=665.64s)]
*  This is a genuinely complex political issue. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  People have the right to peacefully protest. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=670.28s)]
*  I've strongly defended that, even if you don't agree with their point of view. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=672.48s)]
*  And Americans, conservatives and American media are fanning the flames here, taking what would be a [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  local issue and giving it international attention. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=681.6800000000001s)]
*  Today, a copycat freedom convoy trucker protest started in France. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  Similar protests are underway in New Zealand, in Australia. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=689.84s)]
*  And this afternoon, NBC News confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security in the United States [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=693.5600000000001s)]
*  is now warning law enforcement and public safety officials that a copycat trucker protest could [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=698.1999999999999s)]
*  begin in the United States this Super Bowl Sunday. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=703.56s)]
*  The DHS Bulletin says the department has, quote, received reports of truck drivers planning to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=708.28s)]
*  potentially block roads in major metropolitan cities in the United States in protest of, among [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=713.64s)]
*  other things, vaccine mandates for truck drivers. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=720.1999999999999s)]
*  The protest could begin as soon as Sunday in Los Angeles to disrupt the Super Bowl and then travel [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  across the country to disrupt President Biden's State of the Union in D.C. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=729.76s)]
*  on March 1st. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, as much as this is an issue about pandemic requirements and vaccines, it's somehow become an [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  issue about democracy and how we make decisions collectively. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  As these protests spread internationally and come to us here in the United States, how can we make [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=744.6s)]
*  sure we both defend the right to peacefully protest and don't let fringe minorities bully us into [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=749.52s)]
*  accepting their point of view? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=754.88s)]
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=756.8s)]
*  He's a professor of history at Yale University. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=758.28s)]
*  He's the bestselling author of On Tyranny, 20 Lessons from the 20th Century. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=760.84s)]
*  Professor Snyder, good to see you. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=765.56s)]
*  This is a strange one because I'm not even sure as a Canadian that I knew what to make of this or [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  thought that it would be much. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=772.88s)]
*  But it's turning into something that's got tentacles and connections around the world with [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=774.04s)]
*  these anti-government protests and gaining some connective tissue to bigger and sort of more [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  insidious protests that we're seeing. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=787.4s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=788.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like you, I was a little bit uncertain at first. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  I have a lot of friends and colleagues in Canada who write to me about the work that I do, and usually [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=794.04s)]
*  what they're writing about is their concern about their friends in the South, their concern about the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=798.24s)]
*  United States. These last couple of weeks is the first time that I've had lots of Canadians writing to me [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  and saying, hey, you as an American need to speak out about what's happening in Ottawa. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=807.16s)]
*  And I think they think they're right. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=813.0799999999999s)]
*  I think what's concerning about this is, as you've already said, we're talking about a minority of a [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=814.88s)]
*  minority of a minority. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=819.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, there are only about 15000 long haul truckers in Canada. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=821.36s)]
*  Maybe 10 percent of them are directly affected. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=825.7199999999999s)]
*  That's that's 1500 people. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=828.1999999999999s)]
*  And the thing they're protesting against is not actually Canadian law. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=830.24s)]
*  They're protesting against American law. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  It's American law that they have to be vaccinated. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=835.28s)]
*  So protesting in Ottawa makes zero sense. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=837.36s)]
*  So it's a very small group with a nonsensical claim, which nevertheless has begun this spiral, which [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=839.96s)]
*  threatens both the institutions of Canadian democracy, as we see in the capital of Ottawa, and [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=846.68s)]
*  also the Canadian economy, as we see in the border crossings. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=853.84s)]
*  So what I worry about here is that we're seeing a kind of model where a very small number of human [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=857.84s)]
*  beings using tools like trucks funded from another country, as you've already reported, and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=864.08s)]
*  fanned or encouraged by conspiracy theories on social media can do an awful lot of political and [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=871.4000000000001s)]
*  economic damage very quickly. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=877.24s)]
*  So I'm seeing this as as a kind of model, as a kind of dark politics that's emerging. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=879.84s)]
*  And the model doesn't work in a vacuum, right? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=884.84s)]
*  If these truckers existed and nobody talked about them, that'd be one thing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=887.36s)]
*  What do you think the interest is that's coming from right wing media in the United States in these [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=890.48s)]
*  protests? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  I think a big wedge of right wing politics in the United States is about the claim that government [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=897.0s)]
*  doesn't work. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=903.64s)]
*  I mean, it's a form of right wing anarchism, basically. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=904.76s)]
*  And so if that is your view, you take delight in chaos in your own country, but also and perhaps especially [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=908.6s)]
*  in other countries. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=915.76s)]
*  So it can become a kind of a kind of parlor game to sit in Florida or in Washington, D.C., or in a [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=917.28s)]
*  newsroom and root the truckers on in Canada because you like destruction, you like chaos, you want to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=923.76s)]
*  see the deconstruction of the administrative state. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=930.2s)]
*  So if people are carrying that out before you, before your eyes, you're just happy. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=932.76s)]
*  So I think the ideology here has to do precisely with dysfunction and disorder and proving that [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=938.08s)]
*  government can't work. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=944.96s)]
*  And of course, the Canadian government generally works extremely well. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  So if you can suggest that democracy doesn't work in Canada, you know, then you're making a strong [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=949.08s)]
*  argument about democracy in general. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=953.64s)]
*  And of course, this is why it's important to talk to somebody like you, because you study these matters [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=955.36s)]
*  not just in the United States, but around the world. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=959.1600000000001s)]
*  And there is a similarity to the types of protests that are going on around the world that seem to be [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=961.64s)]
*  anti-government, anti-something, not entirely focused on the cause at hand. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=967.64s)]
*  As you point out, the restrictions that these Canadian truckers are protesting by causing, you [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=973.6s)]
*  know, blockages and trouble in Canada are generally speaking, not Canadian laws. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=980.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we don't I mean, we don't have to go so far afield to find examples of this. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in the United States for the past couple of years, protests, which presumably had something to [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=993.96s)]
*  do with vaccine mandates, branch out very quickly into much larger conspiracy theories. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=998.8s)]
*  It's really striking to me how the conspiracy theories that turn up in the social media backdrop of [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1004.04s)]
*  some of the organizers of the Canadian protests are basically the same generic stuff that we also have [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1009.12s)]
*  in the U.S. or we find in Europe or around the world, the same QAnon, the same ideas about Bill Gates. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1013.88s)]
*  It's all it's all generic now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  It's all international now. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1021.0799999999999s)]
*  But I mean, another way that you can think about the connection between Canadians and the rest of the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1022.7199999999999s)]
*  world here is that you can flip this around and think about America now as a kind of bad actor. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1026.6s)]
*  Right. Like if there are lots of Russians who are contributing money to a GoFundMe and then to this [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1031.24s)]
*  you know, then to this Christian site, which which then, you know, funding disorder in the United [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1036.7199999999998s)]
*  States, funding blockades in the capital, funding, funding blockades of border crossings. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1041.1999999999998s)]
*  We would say, hey, that's a hostile action. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1046.12s)]
*  But right now, that's effectively what we're doing. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  We have some private actors in the United States, some very some very well known ones who are [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  organizing behind the destruction of democratic institutions and economic institutions [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1054.12s)]
*  in Canada. If we watch somebody else do that, we would say, hey, that's outrageous. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1059.52s)]
*  I mean, if a former president of another country did what Mr. Trump just did to Justin Trudeau and say [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  that he's a fanatic who's destroyed his country, we would think, well, that's really excessive. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1068.6s)]
*  That's really outrageous. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1073.28s)]
*  So I think, you know, in a way, this puts us in the mirror. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1074.56s)]
*  It's a very strange development, this whole idea of QAnon and Trump flags and Confederate [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1077.0s)]
*  flags in Canada, it's just, as you know, not a thing. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1082.6s)]
*  So to see it becoming a thing is remarkable. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1086.52s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, good to see you. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1088.6799999999998s)]
*  Timothy Snyder is the professor at Yale University. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1089.9599999999998s)]
*  He's the author of On Tyranny. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  We appreciate your time this evening. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1094.9599999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you about the briefing you got on Iran. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1097.6s)]
*  When the United States pulled out of the Iran deal in 2016, it was a fledgling deal, but it [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  was a it had taken a decade to get there and everybody was at least talking to one another. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  Now we have a situation where the Iranians have hardened our neighbors in the region. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1109.8s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia have hardened. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1114.8400000000001s)]
*  The U.S. hasn't hardened. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1116.8s)]
*  The U.S. under Biden would like to get back to this deal. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1117.96s)]
*  But it's going to be much harder to do. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1120.64s)]
*  You talked about that today. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1123.28s)]
*  I did, and I walked out of that briefing really concerned the amount of time right now that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  it would take Iran to get a nuclear weapon after they made the decision to do so is [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1134.68s)]
*  frighteningly short, much shorter than the timeline before the nuclear agreement was [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1139.04s)]
*  signed. And, you know, we essentially tested the theory of the opponents of the Iran [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1144.48s)]
*  deal because Donald Trump withdrew from it. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1151.0s)]
*  He levied unilateral sanctions against Iran. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1153.6399999999999s)]
*  He demanded that they come to the table on all of their malevolent behavior. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1156.44s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  Everything got worse. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1161.8s)]
*  Iran's support for proxies in the Middle East increased. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1163.04s)]
*  Iran restarted its dormant nuclear research. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1166.52s)]
*  Program it got much closer to a nuclear weapon. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1168.96s)]
*  They started shooting at American troops. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  We tried escalation and it was a disaster. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1173.48s)]
*  Diplomacy is the only path forward to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1176.24s)]
*  And interestingly, although Israel remains opposed to the deal, our Gulf allies who were [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1180.28s)]
*  opposed to it back in 2015 now support it because they do not want a nuclear arms race in [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1185.96s)]
*  the Middle East. Well, I have to talk about this again because it's an important issue [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1191.76s)]
*  that's sort of getting sidelined. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1195.1599999999999s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy. Good to see you. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1196.36s)]
*  Chris Murphy is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1198.24s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJDZevEpVo&t=1200.16s)]
