# Russia Ramps Up Nuclear Talk As Position In Ukraine Weakens
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw)
*  He is a Russian diplomat. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=0.0s)]
*  He works for Russia at their U.N. mission in Geneva in Switzerland. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=4.44s)]
*  He's worked for Russia's foreign ministry, their equivalent of our State Department, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  for two decades. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  He's spent a large part of that time serving as an adviser on nuclear nonproliferation [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  for the Russian government. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=17.8s)]
*  Today, he quit. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=18.8s)]
*  And he didn't just quit quietly. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=19.8s)]
*  He turned it up to 11. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  This is how he told his colleagues. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=23.96s)]
*  He said, quote, for 20 years of my diplomatic career, I have seen different turns of our [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=25.36s)]
*  foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24th of this [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=28.96s)]
*  year, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=34.68s)]
*  Quote, this aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine and, in fact, against the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=37.08s)]
*  entire Western world is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also perhaps the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=41.56s)]
*  most serious crime against the people of Russia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=46.24s)]
*  Those who conceived this war want only one thing, to remain in power forever, to live [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=49.38s)]
*  tasteless palaces, to sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=54.82s)]
*  Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=64.06s)]
*  Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=67.9s)]
*  He goes on to say, quote, I studied to be a diplomat and have been a diplomat for 20 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=73.62s)]
*  years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=77.58s)]
*  The foreign ministry has become my home and my family, but I simply cannot any longer [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=78.58s)]
*  share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=81.7s)]
*  The diplomat's name is Boris Bondarev. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=90.58s)]
*  His statement also took a direct shot at his boss, Russia's longtime foreign minister, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=93.86s)]
*  which again is their equivalent of our secretary of state. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=98.14s)]
*  He says of their foreign minister that he, quote, went from a professional and educated [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=101.06s)]
*  intellectual, whom many of my colleagues held in such high esteem, to a person who constantly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=105.98s)]
*  broadcasts conflicting statements and who threatens the world with nuclear weapons. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=110.7s)]
*  And this resignation is fascinating. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=117.42s)]
*  That final point is very provocative, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=119.18s)]
*  This guy who has just quit the highest profile diplomatic resignation since Russia started [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  this war, he's a nuclear nonproliferation expert. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=125.94s)]
*  After he quit today, he told the New York Times he was disturbed by the nonchalance [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=129.94s)]
*  with which some of his fellow Russian diplomats chatted about possible nuclear strikes against [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=134.86s)]
*  the West. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=139.62s)]
*  That is also a thing that is apparently increasingly happening on state controlled Russian TV. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=141.86s)]
*  Mr. Bondarev said of that talk, quote, they think that if you hit some village in America [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=146.18s)]
*  with a nuclear strike, then the Americans will immediately get scared and run to beg [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=150.34s)]
*  for mercy on their knees. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  Quote, that's how many of our people think. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  And I fear that this is the line that they are passing along to Moscow. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=159.74s)]
*  Joining us now is Julia Davis. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  She's a columnist for the Daily Beast. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  She's the founder of the Russian Media Monitor, which tracks Russian government controlled [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=166.98s)]
*  television and propaganda. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=170.5s)]
*  Ms. Davis, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=171.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=176.66s)]
*  Mr. Bondarev today raised this issue in his resignation letter and then in follow-up interviews, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=179.1s)]
*  including with the New York Times, saying the nonchalance and the frequency of discussion [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  about what a good idea it would be to use nuclear weapons, he, as a longtime diplomat, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=189.42s)]
*  as an expert in the field, finds unnerving. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  I have to ask in your monitoring of Russian state television if you're seeing what he's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=196.98s)]
*  describing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=201.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=202.06s)]
*  And it's so refreshing to hear someone who's an insider like him to address it because [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=203.06s)]
*  it's become redundant. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=209.3s)]
*  Every single day, they bring up the idea of nuclear strikes against Ukraine or against [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=211.9s)]
*  the West. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=217.46s)]
*  And it's a nonstop chatter that has been basically normalized at this point, if you could ever [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=218.46s)]
*  normalize anything as abnormal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=224.14s)]
*  They've become a larger, more dangerous North Korea in their rhetoric. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  And this has changed, to be clear. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  This isn't a constant. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  This is something that's changed and become more frequent over the course of this war, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  over these last three months? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=241.1s)]
*  They followed Putin's lead when he said if anyone dares to interfere in what's going [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=242.22s)]
*  on in Ukraine, they will be met with such retaliatory action that they have never contemplated [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=249.34s)]
*  or have seen before. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=255.62s)]
*  And on state television, they are repeatedly reiterating that what he meant was a nuclear [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=257.18s)]
*  strike. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=263.7s)]
*  And they repeat that with a great sense of pride that that is one thing that they know [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=264.7s)]
*  the West fears. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  So they like to constantly repeat it and convince the Russians or attempt to convince them that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=270.06s)]
*  even if they have to die for the motherland, there's no better way to go. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=276.46s)]
*  From your monitoring of this type of propaganda, the state-controlled television in Russia, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=283.06s)]
*  do you feel like that should make the West, that should make the American government, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=288.26s)]
*  that should make us as people observing this, more fearful about the prospect that Putin [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  might choose to use nuclear weapons in either in some tactical way or in some strategic [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=299.26s)]
*  way? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=305.62s)]
*  Do you feel like the saber rattling that you're seeing there should make us feel like this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=306.62s)]
*  is a more acute threat? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=311.66s)]
*  Or do you think this is just a sort of generic sign of belligerence and chest pounding that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=313.26000000000005s)]
*  might not translate directly into a nuclear worry? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  We should remain clear-eyed about Russia's capabilities, but at the same time, keep in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  mind that they are saying it for us to be afraid for the West to stop helping Ukraine. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=328.04s)]
*  So it's definitely posturing, and we need to see it for what it is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  It's the only thing that they could threaten us with. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=338.54s)]
*  They can't threaten us economically. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  There's not much they can do to us, basically. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  So that is one weapon at their disposal that they like to saber-rattle with, and their [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  motive is to make us fear them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=352.22s)]
*  And that's exactly what they're hoping to do, and that should be the opposite of what [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=356.62s)]
*  we do. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=360.54s)]
*  The Russian government has yet to respond to this resignation from Mr. Bondarov today, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=362.82s)]
*  at least as far as I know. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=366.82s)]
*  They haven't responded yet. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=367.82s)]
*  What do you expect their reaction to it will be, or do you think they'll just pretend [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=370.42s)]
*  this didn't happen? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  I can safely predict what they will probably do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=376.42s)]
*  They usually follow the same exact script in these types of instances. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  They will say he's a traitor. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=384.58s)]
*  They will claim that he was offered some sort of a reward by the West, and he sold out. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=386.06s)]
*  And this is the way that they will portray him, especially because his letter was so [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=392.56s)]
*  scathing, because he referred to Navalny's investigations about Lavrov's extended family, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=396.4s)]
*  taking advantage of Oleg Deripaska's luxury properties and Putin's palaces, all of those [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=404.52s)]
*  based on Navalny's investigations. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=411.68s)]
*  So they will certainly try to claim that he is a quote-unquote traitor, simply for exposing [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=413.64s)]
*  corruption and not being willing to put up with their warmongering and horrific acts [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=421.28s)]
*  of aggression that they have engaged in. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=428.4s)]
*  Julia Davis is a columnist at The Daily Bee. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  She's creator of Russian Media Monitor. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=434.8s)]
*  Ms. Davis, thanks for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=436.84s)]
*  It's really helpful to have you here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=439.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O55Mx-ObBaw&t=441.68s)]
