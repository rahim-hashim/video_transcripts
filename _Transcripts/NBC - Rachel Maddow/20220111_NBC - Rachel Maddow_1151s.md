# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 10
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo)
*  We do actually have some breaking news to start with at this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=0.0s)]
*  We can report exclusively tonight that attorneys for former president Donald [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=4.04s)]
*  Trump have now met in person with the Fulton County District Attorney's Office [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=8.8s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=13.92s)]
*  Now, it was months ago that we first learned that the prosecutor who leads that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=15.56s)]
*  office, a prosecutor named Funny Willis, had opened a criminal investigation into [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=19.64s)]
*  alleged violations of Georgia state law that occurred when elections officials in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=25.52s)]
*  Georgia were pressured and intimidated after the last presidential election that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=30.04s)]
*  they should effectively falsify the results of that state's election. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  It was a year ago, January 3rd last year, when the Washington Post published this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  shocking audio recording of an extraordinary hour long phone call that then [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=44.88s)]
*  President Trump made personally to Georgia's top elections official telling him [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=50.6s)]
*  he needed to find exactly the number of votes in the state that would allow Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  to falsely be declared the winner there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Now, in Georgia, as in every state in the country, pressuring elections officials [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=64.72s)]
*  to interfere with the lawful administration of an election, pressuring election [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=68.72s)]
*  officials to change election results, that, of course, is a crime. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=72.72s)]
*  This state prosecutor's office in Fulton County, Georgia, opened that investigation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=77.64s)]
*  under Georgia state law. Pressuring or intimidating election officials is a Georgia [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=84.04s)]
*  state crime. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=88.24s)]
*  It's a crime in every state in the country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=89.56s)]
*  And of course, it's also a federal crime. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=91.16s)]
*  But while U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has made sort of vague patriotic [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=94.16s)]
*  statements about no one being above the law and federal prosecutors following the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  evidence wherever it leads, so far there's no evidence that federal prosecutors are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=104.64s)]
*  investigating that call or any other reported instances of pressure that the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=108.52s)]
*  president personally put on Georgia election officials about the conduct of their [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  official duties. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=118.44s)]
*  So far, the only known criminal investigation into his efforts to falsify the election [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=119.72s)]
*  results anywhere in the country, the only known criminal investigation is that Georgia [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  state investigation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=129.04s)]
*  And as of tonight, again, we can report that that investigation has now proceeded to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=130.44000000000003s)]
*  the point where President Trump's lawyers have started meeting in person with staff [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=136.60000000000002s)]
*  from the Fulton County Prosecutor's Office. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=141.8s)]
*  And in fact, here's one more piece of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=144.28s)]
*  You might remember in December, in mid-December, sort of apparently apropos of nothing, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  former President Trump put out one of his statements that are often hyperbolic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=152.56s)]
*  They can often seem a little bit unhinged, but this one was, again, seemingly apropos [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  of nothing. And it was specifically about prosecutors and investigators. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  And even though his statements often seem unhinged, this seemed particularly unhinged [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  even for him. I'm not going to read you the whole thing, but you will remember it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  I'll read you a piece of it. You'll remember this is from it is from December 18th. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  He said, quote, All the Democrats want to do is put people in jail. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=180.12s)]
*  They are vicious, violent and radical left thugs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  They are destroying people's lives, which is the only thing they are good at. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  Their DAs, attorney generals and Democratic law enforcement are out of control. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=191.96s)]
*  Again, their DAs, AGs and Democratic law enforcement are out of control. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=198.0s)]
*  This is what happens in communist countries and dictatorships. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=203.44s)]
*  The people of our country won't stand for it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=208.24s)]
*  That was December 18th from Trump. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Whoa, girl, calm down. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  What's this about? Easy now? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Easy, easy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=216.68s)]
*  District attorneys and attorneys general and law enforcement. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=218.36s)]
*  Oh, my. They're ruining lives and it's communist dictatorships and the people need to rise. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=221.12s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=225.6s)]
*  Well, we can report tonight that that seemingly sort of unhinged statement from Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=228.08s)]
*  decrying Democrat law enforcement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=233.32s)]
*  That statement happened within days of Trump's attorneys having their previously unreported [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=237.32s)]
*  in-person meeting with the prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, who are investigating [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=244.56s)]
*  Mr. Trump criminally for his alleged actions to pressure election officials in that state. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=249.16s)]
*  That statement, again, within days of that previously unreported meeting by his attorneys [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=254.92s)]
*  in person with the Fulton County Prosecutor's Office. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=260.8s)]
*  Oh, maybe that's what he was so upset about. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=265.24s)]
*  Joining us now is Gwen Keys-Fleming. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=269.2s)]
*  She is someone who has known Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis for many years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  She is the former district attorney of DeKalb County, which is right next to Fulton County. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=274.64s)]
*  Miss Fleming, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=281.44s)]
*  Absolutely. Thank you for having me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=283.08s)]
*  So we're reporting this news, I believe, for the first time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=286.24s)]
*  I'll stand corrected if it turns out that anybody else has reported this, but we think [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=289.48s)]
*  this might be the first time this news has been publicly reported. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=292.6s)]
*  Can you tell us from the perspective of somebody who has been a district attorney in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=297.12s)]
*  Georgia, if there is anything at all that we should read into or we should see this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=300.84s)]
*  as a signifier for in terms of the state of the investigation that the gentleman at the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=306.84s)]
*  center of the investigation, his attorneys are meeting in person with the prosecutor's office? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=313.0s)]
*  Well, I think it signals that things are moving along. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=318.55999999999995s)]
*  I think the fact that defense counsel met with the prosecutors that in and of itself is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=320.91999999999996s)]
*  not remarkable. That happens all the time in Georgia, even before charges are filed, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=325.2s)]
*  particularly in high profile cases where there may be speculation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=330.48s)]
*  I think what's interesting is the statements that we heard after that meeting. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  Like you said, there didn't appear to be context beforehand. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=339.68s)]
*  But now, as you look at this full picture and all of the pieces and facts are coming [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  together, it gives you a new life. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=347.92s)]
*  And let me say, first of all, I had the pleasure of serving with elected district [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=350.12s)]
*  attorneys who were Republican, elected district attorneys who were Democrat. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=354.76s)]
*  And the one thing that is common among all of them is not ever can I ever point to a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  time where any of us made a decision to either prosecute or dismiss a case based on our [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  political affiliation or that of the person that we were investigating. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  So the statements assigning a certain intention to Democrats versus Republicans is just [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  patently false. That does not happen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=381.55999999999995s)]
*  That is a violation of the oath of office. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  And again, I think if you step back, you can begin to put things in context, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  particularly if you go back in history and think about the things that the former [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  president said back in April of 2020 and the eight months leading up to the election [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=397.04s)]
*  where he decried a fair election. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=403.12s)]
*  He indicated that there was rampant fraud through mail in voting and kept saying that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=405.6s)]
*  the election would be rigged. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  And you could see how those early statements then snowballed into what became the big [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=413.32s)]
*  lie of him winning the election and Joe Biden losing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=418.92s)]
*  And so if you take that frame and apply it to these current statements, you can't help [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=423.36s)]
*  but wonder if this is the beginning of a similar playbook where he is trying to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=429.04s)]
*  undermine and create doubt in the integrity of the criminal justice system, just like [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=434.56s)]
*  he did the voting and election system. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=440.04s)]
*  Oh, I see what you mean, that this may be an effort because of what he's expecting to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=442.24s)]
*  happen in this investigation or potentially in others. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=446.88s)]
*  He's trying to seed doubts and seed essentially a critical attitude among those who [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  listen to him and believe him and support him that anybody who does pursue some sort of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  prosecution or otherwise hurtful investigation of him is motivated by partisan means and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=460.32000000000005s)]
*  therefore shouldn't be trusted. He's trying to essentially tilt the or [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=466.24s)]
*  pre-spin what he expects to be negative outcomes from these investigations. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=469.88s)]
*  Is that what you mean? That's exactly right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=473.96s)]
*  Exactly right. The last time that we spoke, Ms. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=476.88s)]
*  Fleming, we spoke a few months ago about some reporting that the district attorney's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  office in Fulton County was considering impaneling a special grand jury in order to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  focus on this case. And obviously, grand juries meet all the time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=492.44s)]
*  Grand juries consider every kind of case that a district attorney has to handle. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=496.72s)]
*  There was reporting several months ago that District Attorney Fonny Wallace in Fulton [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=501.72s)]
*  County is considering impaneling a special grand jury to handle this matter. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=505.72s)]
*  We don't know if that has happened. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=509.32s)]
*  There's no sign that that has happened. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=511.36s)]
*  Is there some sort of timeline that we should be keeping in mind in terms of when [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=514.04s)]
*  decisions like that would need to happen or when you would expect them to happen in [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=517.84s)]
*  terms of the life the lifespan of this investigation? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=521.5600000000001s)]
*  So let me point out, though, special grand juries are very different than regular [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=524.76s)]
*  grand juries. Those are focused on criminal indictments, regular grand juries, and they [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=529.48s)]
*  turn over every two months. So a special grand jury does not produce indictments. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  It would produce a final report that would be critical in signaling what the citizens [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=539.4s)]
*  of Fulton County may or how they may be viewing the facts and evidence that was presented [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=544.8s)]
*  before them about this case. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=550.04s)]
*  But in terms of timing, it would need to be specially impaneled. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=552.92s)]
*  The DA would need to write a motion or submit a motion to the chief judge of Superior [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=557.28s)]
*  Court asking for the special grand jury. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=562.64s)]
*  And then there would be really, I want to say, no time limit on how long it could [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  convene. That would all be dictated by the complexity of the case. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  And so I've had special grand juries that were impaneled for a year because of the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=578.24s)]
*  type of matters that we were looking at. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=583.2s)]
*  But what that does, it gives you a continuous group of dedicated citizens reviewing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=585.84s)]
*  your evidence and they can look at the whole picture that every fact, every document, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=593.64s)]
*  every tape, every witness statement, every piece of the puzzle that paints the picture [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=599.44s)]
*  about what happened. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=607.08s)]
*  And after reviewing all of that, they would write a report as to whether they thought [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=608.84s)]
*  there was sufficient evidence for criminal charges to be brought. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=614.32s)]
*  And that would then give the district attorney a leg to stand on, if you would, that her [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=618.24s)]
*  case was being evaluated by the actual citizens and not just the folks in her office. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=624.32s)]
*  If she made a motion to the chief judge of Superior Court, as you said, in order to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=631.5600000000001s)]
*  panel such a special grand jury, would that be a public facing motion or would that be [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  something that would be confidential? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=638.88s)]
*  They usually are public based. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=641.3199999999999s)]
*  Gwen, Keith Fleming, thank you very much for your expertise here. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=644.48s)]
*  It's absolutely invaluable to have your help understanding these stories. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=647.84s)]
*  Former District Attorney into Cabb County, Georgia, Miss Fleming, thank you so much for [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=650.84s)]
*  your time tonight. Glad to be here. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=654.24s)]
*  Thank you. In addition to meeting to describe themselves as the electors from the state [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=656.8s)]
*  of Wisconsin, even though they weren't, we subsequently learned that this group of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=662.96s)]
*  Republicans in a state that Biden won, they put pen to paper. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=666.52s)]
*  They not only declared that day that they were the real electors and they were electors [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=670.84s)]
*  for Trump, they actually drew up forged documents in which they tried to impersonate [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=675.32s)]
*  real electors. They purported to be the actual electors from the state of Wisconsin. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=681.72s)]
*  And they apparently sent them in to the National Archives and to the Congress as if they [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=686.64s)]
*  were the real electors. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=691.84s)]
*  So so we reported on that last month just before Christmas and on the still live [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=693.48s)]
*  question in Wisconsin as to whether or not any of those 10 Republicans who signed their [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=699.6s)]
*  names to those forged documents, whether they could actually be prosecuted for forgery, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=703.72s)]
*  for having signed their names to this document, impersonating real electors. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=709.48s)]
*  It's still an open question in Wisconsin. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  It's an open question before the state election board, potentially before the Milwaukee [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=716.12s)]
*  District Attorney. So that's what we reported right before Christmas in Wisconsin. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=719.76s)]
*  But now look at this. Politico reporter Nicholas Wu had the really good idea to file [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  public records requests in multiple states asking to see what officials in those states [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=732.72s)]
*  had handed over to the January 6th investigation. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=739.64s)]
*  Look at these documents here. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=743.28s)]
*  Turns out it wasn't just Wisconsin. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=745.28s)]
*  On the left side of your screen, these are the similar forged documents from Republicans [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=748.52s)]
*  in Michigan, purporting to be the electors from the state of Michigan, casting their [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  votes for Trump, even though Michigan voted for Biden. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=759.48s)]
*  On the right side of your screen, these are newly unearthed forged documents from [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  Republicans in Arizona, again, purporting to be the real electors from the state of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=768.2s)]
*  Arizona, casting their votes for Trump, even though in reality, Trump lost Arizona and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=772.8399999999999s)]
*  Biden won. Now, in both instances, just like the documents we dug up in Wisconsin, in [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=778.28s)]
*  both instances, these really are forgeries. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=783.7199999999999s)]
*  If you're a state that Trump lost and Biden won, the electors from your state are [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=788.4s)]
*  electors for Biden. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=794.1999999999999s)]
*  But nevertheless, in both these instances, here's Republicans in Michigan and Arizona [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=795.9599999999999s)]
*  pretending to be their state's electors, pretending to be electors for Trump. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=800.16s)]
*  And I can tell you, I mean, based on our previous reporting about what Republicans did [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=805.6s)]
*  with these forgeries in Wisconsin, in Michigan, it looks exactly the same. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=809.88s)]
*  In these Michigan documents, it looks exactly like the forgery we previously reported on [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=813.92s)]
*  from Wisconsin, except it's 16 electoral votes instead of 10 and the names are [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=818.52s)]
*  different. Other than that, it's basically word for word and even matching formatting, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=822.56s)]
*  matching fonts. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=826.64s)]
*  Two, the president of the United States Senate and the archivist of the United States and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=828.64s)]
*  the Michigan secretary of state and the chief judge of the U.S. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=832.76s)]
*  District Court in the Western District of Michigan pursuant to three U.S. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=835.04s)]
*  Code Section 11, enclosed, please find Michigan's electoral votes for president and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=838.48s)]
*  vice president. We the undersigned, being the duly elected and qualified electors, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=843.8s)]
*  no, you're not, for president and vice president of the United States of America and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=850.48s)]
*  the state of Michigan do hereby certify the following that we convened and organized in [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=854.76s)]
*  the state capital in the city of Lansing and performed the duties enjoined upon us. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=859.44s)]
*  Being so assembled and duly organized, we proceeded to vote by ballot for President [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=864.32s)]
*  Trump, 16 votes, Vice President Pence, 16 votes. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=868.96s)]
*  They are purporting to be the duly elected electors of the state of Michigan. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=873.0400000000001s)]
*  They are not. And then these 16 Republicans from Michigan all sign their name. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=876.72s)]
*  To this forgery as if they really are the Michigan electors. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  And these really are the official results of the election in the state of Michigan, a [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=889.44s)]
*  forged document purporting to represent the real election results in that state. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=893.1600000000001s)]
*  Again, that's Michigan. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=897.84s)]
*  And again, it looks exactly like the document from Wisconsin. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=899.72s)]
*  In Arizona, interestingly, the formatting is different there. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  And the Arizona Republican reported at the time that this had happened, that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=908.4s)]
*  Republicans in Arizona were trying to do something like this. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=912.52s)]
*  But as far as I know, we'd never actually seen the forged documents themselves [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=915.0799999999999s)]
*  before now. But thanks to Nicholas Wu's reporting at Politico, here it is. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=920.64s)]
*  Page one has the official state seal of the state of Arizona. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=925.16s)]
*  And then that repeats throughout the document. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=928.52s)]
*  The whole thing oddly has a notary stamp on it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=930.9599999999999s)]
*  Each of the signatures is notarized. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=933.72s)]
*  But it's headlined the seeding and voting of presidential electors for the general [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=936.36s)]
*  election of 2020. The enclosed seeding and voting electors documents amend the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=940.64s)]
*  previously submitted documents. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=945.28s)]
*  Whatever you've gotten before, these are the real ones. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=947.72s)]
*  And you see the headline here again under the actual state seal from Arizona, the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=951.24s)]
*  certificate of ascertainment of the electors. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=954.9200000000001s)]
*  And then all the rest of the pages are each of those 11 Republicans [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=958.72s)]
*  purporting to be electors, each of them one by one solemnly attesting and signing [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=964.2s)]
*  their names to this document that says they're the real presidential electors [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=969.64s)]
*  from Arizona. And they cast their electoral college votes for Donald Trump and Mike [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=973.04s)]
*  Pence, each one of them individually signed and notarized under the official [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  seal of the great state of Arizona. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=982.36s)]
*  These documents are forgeries. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=984.0s)]
*  These people are not the real electors, both in Michigan and in Arizona, just [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=986.72s)]
*  like we saw in Wisconsin. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=992.24s)]
*  The real electors in all these states were Biden-Harris electors because Biden [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=995.72s)]
*  and Harris won those states. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=999.04s)]
*  But in at least these three states that Biden won, we now know and we can now see [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  the forgeries that Republicans tried to pass off as real electoral certifications. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1006.16s)]
*  So their fake votes could somehow be counted in the electoral college instead of [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1011.68s)]
*  the real ones. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1016.76s)]
*  And again, crucially, this was not just play acting. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1018.92s)]
*  They were not apparently just drawing these things up to have like a little [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1023.04s)]
*  bureaucratic Christmas pageant in 2020 where they could pretend Trump really won. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1027.36s)]
*  And wouldn't that be fun to play dress up and act it out? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1031.28s)]
*  I mean, they actually sent these forged documents into the government. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1034.2399999999998s)]
*  Purporting to be real, they sent them to the Congress, they sent them to the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1040.28s)]
*  National Archives. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  Nicholas Wu reports today at politico.com that part of the reason we know that is [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1044.9599999999998s)]
*  that the National Archives last December forwarded the Arizona forgeries to the [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1049.4799999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State in Arizona, quote, for your awareness. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1056.12s)]
*  The National Archives making clear they were not planning to act on these forged [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  documents, but the Secretary of State should know they exist. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1063.52s)]
*  The Secretary of State in Arizona, Katie Hopps, responded, at least in part, by [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1066.4799999999998s)]
*  sending a cease and desist letter to the Republican fake electors telling them they [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1071.1599999999999s)]
*  at least really truly needed to stop using the official state seal. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1076.9599999999998s)]
*  Now, interestingly, we don't know what ultimately became of the forged documents [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aueu9uTN-Bo&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
