# Ukrainian Forces Emboldened As Russians Abandon Areas Around Kyiv
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU)
*  Joining us now from Lviv is Sudarsan Raghavan, the correspondent at large for the Washington Post. In his latest reporting, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=0.0s)]
*  he talked to Ukrainian soldiers in a town near Kyiv as they tried to push the Russians out. Sudarsan, good to see you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=5.72s)]
*  Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=12.44s)]
*  I want to talk first about what I said at the top of the show, the reports of two Ukrainian military helicopters [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=14.44s)]
*  striking a Russian oil depot. Doesn't sound like that big of a deal given how many missile strikes and attacks there have been in Ukraine, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=20.96s)]
*  but it really is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=27.8s)]
*  It's a huge deal. I mean, no one expected this to happen at all. I mean, throughout this, about the past six weeks, the Ukrainians have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=31.0s)]
*  basically done a lot of mostly defensive action, and it's only been in the past week or so they started mounting counteroffensives on specific targets, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=38.4s)]
*  you know, in and around Kyiv and others, but very small kind of localized counteroffensives. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=47.96s)]
*  So the fact that they went across the border, took two helicopters and knocked out this this oil depot is extremely significant for several reasons. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=53.88s)]
*  Chief among them is is that, first of all, it shows that the Ukrainians have the capability to go across and do something like this and take the battle [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=65.28s)]
*  into Russian soil. But at the same time, it also challenges Russia's seriously challenges Russia's narrative of the war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=74.6s)]
*  The Russian propaganda machine has, you know, has told Russian people and the world that basically that they are in control. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=83.04s)]
*  They had destroyed the Ukrainian air forces, their air bases that, you know, and so these this attack literally shows that the that the Russians were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  wrong and and and and they don't have the war under control and the Ukrainians still have the capability of air capability of doing such a massive hit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  So, Darson, you reported this week from a town near Kyiv where Ukrainian forces were engaged in pushing the Russians back. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  And I want to just play a little bit of the video that accompanied your story. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=119.72s)]
*  This is of a Ukrainian soldier who comes across a backpack abandoned by a Russian soldier. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=123.6s)]
*  Oh, he forgot his ammo when he was running and the scissors. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=131.28s)]
*  Well, that's not very useful. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, he was a machine gunner. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=142.84s)]
*  Yes, he was a machine gunner. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=145.96s)]
*  You see, I'm just looking for something useful because that's how war works. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  That's useful. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  Give us a sense, Sudarsan, of what that was about and how these Ukrainian troops that you encountered are feeling about about this war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=160.44s)]
*  Right. Well, as you can see from this video, Sergeant Anton Kolombet, and you could see that the confidence he was feeling, he was extremely calm. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=168.16s)]
*  He picked up this backpack and looking for things of use and and you can you can really see it now that that event was on a Tuesday. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=176.92s)]
*  And even more in that town of Moshun, there was shelling going on incessantly. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=186.12s)]
*  And so the Russians were only about two miles away and they were they were shelling us and the returnees were returning the fire. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=192.04s)]
*  And the very next day, too, one of our photographers went there and the shelling also continued on that Wednesday. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=200.64s)]
*  So between Thursday and Friday, the Russians just departed the airport. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=207.04s)]
*  That town, by the way, is only five miles away from the airport. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  You talked about at the beginning of the of the program, the hospital airport, which the the Russians want to use to try and capture the capital, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=215.8s)]
*  Kiev. So, you know, in this town, the soldiers were extremely confident they had, you know, just a week earlier, they had managed to push the Russians out of this village. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=224.2s)]
*  And they were using all sorts of ambushes, guerrilla tactics, street fighting. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=235.48s)]
*  They even destroyed a dam, they told me, nearby, which allowed the river that was that's flowing by this village to flood up. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=239.72s)]
*  That prevented Russian forces from bringing in reinforcements and resupplying their their soldiers inside the village. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=248.4s)]
*  And they had to literally push back and let us cross that flooded river now to get away from the from the Ukrainian forces. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=256.48s)]
*  So, yeah, it was it was a significant victory for the Ukrainians. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=264.76s)]
*  But I think at that moment, no one, not a single soldier at earlier in the week, had expected that the Russians would just simply pick up and leave the airport as well as and leave the entire areas around the capital. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGrwZXDSUnU&t=269.68s)]
