# 'Cycle of doom': Social Security degradation evident as Trump cuts and changes cause feedback loop
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE)
*  The American people are scared to death that you're really going after Social Security. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=0.0s)]
*  Not only did my constituent not get his payment in February, they went to his bank account [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  and tried to claw back previous payments from January and December. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=13.8s)]
*  And then what did he do? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=18.56s)]
*  He had to go down to the building in Seattle, the federal building that you're trying to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=20.0s)]
*  close and stand in line for hours and hours and hours to try to say he wasn't dead and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=24.32s)]
*  to stop taking his money. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=30.64s)]
*  Washington state Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell today bringing a story from her home [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=34.68s)]
*  state paper to a confirmation hearing for Donald Trump's nominee to run the Social [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=38.96s)]
*  Security Administration. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=43.92s)]
*  Senator Cantwell told that story today from the Seattle Times about this 82 year old Washington [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=45.68s)]
*  state resident who was mistakenly declared dead by Social Security, which resulted in his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  benefits being taken away. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  He first tried to fix the problem over the phone. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  And then as you heard the Senator tell the committee there, he went down to the local [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=60.52s)]
*  Social Security office in person to try to sort it out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=63.36s)]
*  This is from the Seattle Times, quote, It was like a depression era scene, he said, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=66.56s)]
*  with a queue 50 deep jockeying for the attentions of two tellers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=71.08000000000001s)]
*  The employees were kind but beleaguered. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=75.44s)]
*  Quote, they are so understaffed down there, he said. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=77.56s)]
*  They think the office is about to be closed down and they don't know where they're [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=80.28s)]
*  going to go. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=82.96s)]
*  It feels like the agency is being gutted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=83.96s)]
*  After waiting for four hours, Mr. Johnson admits he jumped the line. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  He says, quote, I saw an opening and I kind of just rushed up and told them I was listed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  as dead. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=94.32s)]
*  That seemed to get their attention. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=95.5s)]
*  One story, one town, one retired person trying to straighten out one problem with Social [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=98.88s)]
*  Security and finding a depression era scene when he did so. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=102.72s)]
*  But as Donald Trump and his top campaign donor and whatever Doge is continue to hack [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=108.88s)]
*  away at the way Social Security runs as an administration, the questions about Social [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=115.16s)]
*  Security are moving beyond an anecdote here or there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=120.44s)]
*  The question, of course, is how much the agency can take before it just stops working altogether. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=123.32s)]
*  This is from the Washington Post today, quote, Long waits, waves of calls, website crashes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=127.84s)]
*  Social Security is breaking down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=135.4s)]
*  The Washington Post today provided this riveting reporting from Social Security offices around [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=138.68s)]
*  the country, quote, in one office in central Indiana, the phone lines are jammed by nine [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=142.44s)]
*  a.m. with hundreds of retirees further taxing a staff of less than a dozen that is responsible [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  for nearly 70,000 claimants across the state. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=153.36s)]
*  The questions have become predictable. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=157.84s)]
*  What is the U.S. Doge service doing to Social Security? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=159.56s)]
*  Will the office close? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  Will my benefits continue? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=163.4s)]
*  The employees with no training yet on the impending changes have few answers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=165.46s)]
*  Quote, I hope we're going to be here, the employee tells caller after caller, but I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=169.26000000000002s)]
*  can't guarantee anything. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=173.3s)]
*  This is what the Post found in Baltimore, Maryland. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=176.3s)]
*  Quote, in Baltimore, an employee who works on critical payment systems said nearly a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=178.82s)]
*  quarter of his team is already gone or will soon be out the door. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=182.74s)]
*  Quote, the reduction in highly skilled staff is already having consequences. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  The staffer said his office is supposed to complete several software updates and modernization [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  processes that are required by law within the next few weeks and months. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=195.38s)]
*  But with the departures, it seems increasingly likely that it will miss those deadlines. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=199.86s)]
*  His team has also called on to fix complicated technology glitches that stop payments. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=204.66s)]
*  But many of the experts who make those fixes are exiting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=209.96s)]
*  He explains that glitches have to get cleaned up on a case-by-case basis. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=214.02s)]
*  The experts in how to do that are leaving. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=218.34s)]
*  Quote, we will have cases that get stuck, and they're not going to be able to get [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=220.46s)]
*  fixed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=224.3s)]
*  All could be out of benefits for months. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=225.34s)]
*  Again, that is from the Washington Post today, where they interviewed more than two dozen [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=228.34s)]
*  people and reviewed internal documents for this report. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  That headline again, long waits, waves of calls, website crashes, Social Security is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=236.34s)]
*  breaking down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=241.18s)]
*  Joining us now is Lisa Ryan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=243.3s)]
*  She's a reporter for the Washington Post. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=244.3s)]
*  She's the lead byline on this story. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  Ms. Ryan, thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=249.18s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  So you and your colleagues report that, for example, among all the other things, the Social [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=253.38s)]
*  Security website in the last 10 days, or in a span of 10 days, has crashed four times. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=257.38s)]
*  Managers are so short-staffed, they're doing double duty as receptionists, they're taking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  frontline phone calls. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=266.86s)]
*  What would you describe the atmosphere like, the mood like, the morale like among the Social [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=269.38s)]
*  Security staffers who are left at these frontline offices? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=273.26s)]
*  I think the field staff is extremely anxious, and some of them are also extremely angry [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=278.42s)]
*  because they're trying to do their jobs. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=283.62s)]
*  These are not high paying jobs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=286.82000000000005s)]
*  And what's happened is that an acting commissioner appointed by Donald Trump has come in and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=289.1s)]
*  working with Elon Musk's Doge team has moved really swiftly to downsize this agency. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=295.5s)]
*  He wants to get rid of 7,000 employees. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=304.7s)]
*  That's about a little over 12%. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  And he's well on his way to doing this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=310.5s)]
*  And they've offered early retirement packages, buyouts. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=312.98s)]
*  Some people have been fired. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=319.3s)]
*  Others have just quit because they're so frustrated. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=321.18s)]
*  And this field staff, they take these jobs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=324.5s)]
*  These are not easy jobs. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=326.86s)]
*  And yet, you know, one by one, the field offices and the call centers, you know, that handle [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  this really deteriorating phone service on the 800 line are just, you know, they're [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=334.54s)]
*  really eroding. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=341.06s)]
*  And it's just got to be frustrating, of course, for the staff and also for all the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=342.3s)]
*  retirees and disabled people who are trying to get service. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=346.5s)]
*  Some of the impact of what Trump has done to the Social Security administration strikes [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  me as just very granularly specific in a way that is understandable even to people who [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  have no idea how this agency runs. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  A Doge-imposed spending freeze has currently left many field offices without paper, pens [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=365.46000000000004s)]
*  or phone headsets. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  At the exact moment, phone calls are spiking. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=373.42s)]
*  This includes the freeze that drove all federal credit cards to a $1 limit. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, even if you don't take Social Security benefits yourself, even if you've never [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=380.54s)]
*  been to this kind of agency, you imagine trying to run any sort of customer service [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=384.58s)]
*  operation without having pens or paper or headsets to answer the phone. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=388.58s)]
*  It does seem like there's I got the sense from your reporting that there's no relief [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=393.58s)]
*  in sight for those types of granular difficulties that make it just impossible to do almost [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=398.58s)]
*  anything. Is that fair? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=403.58s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=405.86s)]
*  And and I think, you know, we really don't know kind of what the end game is here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=407.02s)]
*  The nominee, President Trump's nominee to run Social Security had a hearing today before [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=413.3s)]
*  the Senate Finance Committee. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=419.82000000000005s)]
*  And you know, there was a bipartisan group of senators who asked him, look, you know, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  you really need to address customer service issues and you need to figure out, you know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=428.38s)]
*  how many cuts to the staff and to service are really acceptable, because otherwise this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=433.98s)]
*  agency is going to grind to a halt. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=442.18s)]
*  And he said he would address these issues. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=444.62s)]
*  He talked about using artificial intelligence. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  He said, well, you know, maybe we we do need to reconsider some of these cuts. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=450.18s)]
*  But for now, you know, it's not just the staff cuts, though, Rachel, it's also policy [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=454.82000000000005s)]
*  changes that the acting commissioner in charge has made. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=461.46000000000004s)]
*  And this is all in the name of fraud, fighting fraud. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=466.54s)]
*  And there's a real obsession of Elon Musk and his team that fraud is a huge issue at [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=471.14s)]
*  Social Security. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=476.46s)]
*  And, you know, there is fraud. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=477.9s)]
*  There's fraud in every federal program. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=479.85999999999996s)]
*  And this is a really big one. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=482.02s)]
*  So the fraud estimates seem really high in comparison, you know. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=484.21999999999997s)]
*  But when you think about the actual spending on benefits, it's not that that considerable, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=490.26s)]
*  less than one percent. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=495.82s)]
*  But in the name of reducing fraud, what the Trump official who's in charge is now doing [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=498.02s)]
*  is, you know, he's actually made it harder for a variety of people, largely people who [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=504.26s)]
*  can't use computers to actually do things like verify their identity or make direct [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=510.02s)]
*  deposits. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=518.02s)]
*  All this now can't be done by phone, but it has to be done by going to a field office [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=519.3s)]
*  if you can't do it online. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=524.9s)]
*  But, you know, as we've just talked about, the field offices are just fraying. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=526.74s)]
*  So this is sort of a weird, you know, kind of cycle of doom that is is now going on. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=532.5s)]
*  I don't know how it's going to end. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=539.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's not it's not going to end unless they take affirmative action to end it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=541.38s)]
*  And it does not seem there's nothing that we've seen in any reporting that there's [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=546.1s)]
*  any intention to fix any of these things as they keep getting worse. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=549.3s)]
*  Really vivid reporting and really and I know I know it took a lot of shoe leather to do [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=553.7s)]
*  it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=557.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you to you and your colleagues for doing this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=558.1800000000001s)]
*  Lisa Rein from The Washington Post. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=559.86s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=561.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPYZ7i-uVE&t=561.98s)]
