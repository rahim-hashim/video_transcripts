# Democrats Work To Convince Manchin, Sinema Of The 'Changed Circumstance' Needing New Rules
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E)
*  I've been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=0.0s)]
*  months. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=5.48s)]
*  I'm tired of being quiet. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=6.48s)]
*  State legislators can pass anti-voting laws. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=10.6s)]
*  They're simple majorities. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=12.88s)]
*  If they can do that, then the United States Senate should be able to protect voting rights [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=15.44s)]
*  by a simple majority. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=18.88s)]
*  Today, I'm making it clear to protect our democracy by support changing the Senate rules, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=22.48s)]
*  whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=33.72s)]
*  on voting rights. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=40.08s)]
*  When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=44.44s)]
*  United States Senate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=50.48s)]
*  What effect does this kind of public clarion call from the president of the United States [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=53.4s)]
*  have on the holdouts among Democratic senators who have said thus far that however noble [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=58.68s)]
*  the cause, there are no. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Joining us now is Senator Amy Klobuchar. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=66.52s)]
*  She's chair of the rules committee. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=68.4s)]
*  She's one of the lead sponsors of the Freedom to Vote Act. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=69.4s)]
*  She traveled to Georgia with Vice President Harris today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=71.72s)]
*  She just returned to D.C. tonight aboard Air Force One with President Biden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=74.12s)]
*  Senator, it's really great to see you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=77.8s)]
*  I know it's been a long day. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=79.4s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=80.4s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=81.4s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=82.4s)]
*  Let me just ask you about your question. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=83.4s)]
*  Yes, go ahead. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=84.4s)]
*  Oh, well, just before we get into what's going on in the Senate, which is the key question, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=85.4s)]
*  I did want to say President Biden's speech was wonderful tonight, as was Vice President [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=90.64s)]
*  Harris's. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=95.0s)]
*  But there was this moment where he talked about how there's a moment in time, and this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=96.0s)]
*  has happened through history, where time basically stops. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=100.76s)]
*  And he brought up the bomb blowing up in that church in Birmingham. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=104.52s)]
*  He brought up when John Lewis crossed that bridge and when he got hit and people got [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  killed and people got injured. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=115.36s)]
*  And he brought up January 6th. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=117.48s)]
*  There are those moments. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=120.0s)]
*  And this is one of those moments. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=121.2s)]
*  It didn't begin on January 6th. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  It didn't end there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  It's been a concerted effort, as you know, and you just talked about on your show, over [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=125.76s)]
*  400 bills introduced across the country, many of them passed to take people's rights away [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  to vote. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=134.72s)]
*  Reverend Warnock has said repeatedly, some people don't want some people to vote. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=135.76s)]
*  That is what's going on. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=140.48s)]
*  And it's our very democracy depends on it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=141.48s)]
*  This is a moment when time stands still. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=144.48s)]
*  And that is the argument we are making to these two senators. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=147.12s)]
*  I was also struck, Senator Klobuchar, with the argument that the president made about [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=151.68s)]
*  the way the partisan shift on this issue has changed over time, the way he went out of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=156.24s)]
*  his way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=160.36s)]
*  You know, speaking in Atlanta, speaking in blue dot Atlanta in what is now Blue State, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=162.0s)]
*  Georgia, talking before a very supportive audience, but making the case in part by talking [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  about how Republicans until quite recently unanimously, all but unanimously supported [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=170.72000000000003s)]
*  voting rights in the Voting Rights Act. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=176.96s)]
*  People like George W. Bush, people like Strom Thurmond. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  He had an extended reflection on Strom Thurmond, the anti civil rights icon who in the end [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=181.24s)]
*  supported the Voting Rights Act. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=188.24s)]
*  And this is something that even Republicans found necessary to do by massive margins in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=190.4s)]
*  the past. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  That is both an indictment of Republicans, but also of Democrats who won't do what needs [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  to be done in order to get it passed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  I wondered about what your what your reflections were on him talking so much about how the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=203.6s)]
*  partisanship around this issue has calcified in a way that we've never seen before. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=208.04s)]
*  Well, I think it makes the case right, because there's many of us, as you know, I cherish [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  the work I've done across the aisle. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=217.24s)]
*  Passed a bunch of bills. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  I think I mentioned that quite a few times in the presidential debate stage. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  But the point is that right now there's no they aren't playing in on this right now, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=224.16s)]
*  even though and that's why I think he felt it was important to make the case in the past. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Democracy triumphs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  That's more important than any divides between us. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=237.12s)]
*  But right now, because of the shadow, large shadow of Donald Trump over the Republican [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=239.92s)]
*  Party, there are very few people that are willing to stand up like you're seeing with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=244.56s)]
*  Liz Cheney with the January 6th commission that she's willing to stand up over in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  House. And there's just not that happening right now in the Senate when it comes to voting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  rights. And the case that I have made to my colleagues in those rooms where we want it [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=258.12s)]
*  to happen, to quote Hamilton, is that the filibuster has it is unbelievable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=263.92s)]
*  Changes to the filibuster are not radical. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=271.92s)]
*  They have happened 160 times. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=274.56s)]
*  Rachel, changes have happened where bills have been passed without the 60 vote. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=276.52s)]
*  Nineteen seventy seven national gas policy, 1980 selective service system, 1987 national [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=281.44s)]
*  defense bill, 1995 endangered species bill, the Bush tax cuts, the Trump tax cuts through [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=288.08s)]
*  reconciliation. What just happened with Mitch McConnell in the debt ceiling? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=295.52s)]
*  History is riddled with exceptions and changes that were made. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=299.96s)]
*  And it was Robert Byrd himself. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  And I've said told this and to several to Senator Manchin several times who once said, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=306.88s)]
*  you know, you change the rules when there's changed circumstances. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, Rachel, an all out assault on our democracy is a change circumstance. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=315.64s)]
*  We're going to see if we believe Senator Schumer about the timing here as soon as tomorrow, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  as late as Monday, Martin Luther King Day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=326.56s)]
*  We are going to see a vote in the Senate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  Is there anything else we should look for ahead of that vote in terms of conversations, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  events, pronouncements or we just we just wait to see how it's going to go when the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  roll call happens? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of drama right now, I'll give you that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=342.56s)]
*  But I think that's good. That's democracy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=344.52s)]
*  And we are negotiating. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  We are talking to both senators, groups of people, our whole voting group that's been [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=347.84s)]
*  involved by the beginning, including, of course, Senator Schumer and Senator Merkley and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=353.36s)]
*  Kane and King and Tester and Padilla and Warnock. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=358.76s)]
*  It is a group that is not giving up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=362.92s)]
*  And as our other senators who've been involved in meeting with Senator Sinema, because people [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=366.12s)]
*  feel so strongly about this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=371.32s)]
*  And I want to make clear to your viewers today, this is not a liberal moderate divide. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=372.64s)]
*  There are two senators who are working through this with us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=378.08s)]
*  But there are a whole bunch of moderates and people from states like Senator Tester, Montana, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=382.76000000000005s)]
*  who've seen good democracy rules. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  And then suddenly, after 15 years, you've got same day registration taken away in that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  state. Get thousands of people ever lied on that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=395.68s)]
*  Just one example that you don't always hear about, that is this all out of salt on democracy [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=398.8s)]
*  across the country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=404.16s)]
*  And I know when you look through history and we're there, we were there in Georgia where [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  history happened. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=409.88s)]
*  Federal government response, they may not do it right away, but we can't wait anymore. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=412.28s)]
*  The federal government responded when there were civil rights violations. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=416.44s)]
*  The federal government responded throughout history when things have happened. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=420.2s)]
*  And it's on us right now. And it's we're just making the case to these two senators as [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=424.24s)]
*  a severus Lee. And I'm giving you a lot of the arguments I use all the time as we can. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=429.28s)]
*  This is not a radical change. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=433.64s)]
*  What is radical is people who are undermining our democracy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=435.44s)]
*  That's what's radical. And it is on us to write it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=439.52s)]
*  We can always have difference of opinion. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=442.52s)]
*  Democrats are Republicans. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=444.44s)]
*  But our job is to make sure, as you pointed out earlier in the show, the votes are counted [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXhPEDIKz_E&t=446.08s)]
