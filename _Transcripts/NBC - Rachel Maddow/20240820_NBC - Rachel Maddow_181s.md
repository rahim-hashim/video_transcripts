# 'Perfectly delivered': Rachel Maddow reacts to Michelle Obama's 'stunning speech' at the DNC
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c)
*  20 years after a Democratic National Convention speech that launched his career in national [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=0.0s)]
*  politics, now speaking as the 44th president of the United States, a final speech tonight [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=6.44s)]
*  from former President Barack Obama. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=13.08s)]
*  The three final speeches tonight from the first, excuse me, from the second gentleman, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=16.2s)]
*  Doug Amhoff, winning the Relatability Olympics and telling the love story of his relationship [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=20.56s)]
*  with Kamala Harris. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=28.8s)]
*  They celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary this week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=29.8s)]
*  In fact, on Thursday night, the night that she will accept formally the nomination of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=33.04s)]
*  the Democratic Party for president of the United States, his speech followed immediately [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  by a speech from Michelle Obama that I have to say is one of the best convention speeches [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=42.56s)]
*  I've ever seen by anybody in any circumstance. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Not just because she's good at giving a speech, but because it was subtle and deep and thought-provoking [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  and surprising. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=58.16s)]
*  She did make a parallel point that her husband made as well in his speech about how this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=60.28s)]
*  is going to be a close election and how there are practical things that need to be done. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=65.04s)]
*  But her speech, speaking from a place, both a practical and very heartfelt place about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=69.44s)]
*  what it is to be a person in politics, what it is to be a person in politics when you [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  feel like you've got the momentum, but also when it feels like the momentum is gone and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=79.4s)]
*  when there's despair around your prospects and when you make mistakes and what people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=83.48s)]
*  need to do to shore you up in that moment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=86.9s)]
*  Very unusual, I think perfectly delivered and just a stunning speech. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama starting his remarks by saying, I'm feeling fired up, I'm feeling ready to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=95.54s)]
*  go even if I am the only person stupid enough to speak right after Michelle Obama. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=101.26s)]
*  He then gave a great speech that began with a long detailed ode to his vice president, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden, calling that decision to choose Biden as his running mate one of the best [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=113.58s)]
*  decisions he ever made and then going on in detail about the accomplishments of Biden's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=117.94s)]
*  own presidency before moving on to talk about not just the necessity of electing Kamala Harris, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=121.92s)]
*  but again, a subtle, deep, original, interesting take on the things that divide us as Americans, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=127.66s)]
*  not just politically, but culturally. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=134.3s)]
*  Talking about our atomized existences in the culture that we have right now and how the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=136.66s)]
*  enthusiasm around this campaign right now can be one of the ways that we can feel confident [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=141.72s)]
*  that we can come together in common purpose. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  Deep interesting speeches from both Mr. and Mrs. Obama and something fun and original [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=149.52s)]
*  and great and moving from Doug Emhoff. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUfUsWQUP8c&t=156.68s)]
