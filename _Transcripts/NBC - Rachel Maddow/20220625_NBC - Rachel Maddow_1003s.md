# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w)
*  When the Supreme Court first handed down the decision in Roe just shy of 50 years ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=0.0s)]
*  it's not like it was not controversial when it happened. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=4.8s)]
*  There were definitely people who were opposed to the Roe versus Wade decision in 1973, in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=8.84s)]
*  particular the Catholic Church, which had always been staunchly anti-abortion. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=12.8s)]
*  But it wasn't as controversial in 1973 as today's politics about it might make you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=18.84s)]
*  think. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=23.92s)]
*  It was not a particularly controversial decision among American evangelicals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=25.92s)]
*  The Southern Baptist Convention, America's largest Protestant denomination, they adopted [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=32.92s)]
*  pro-abortion rights resolutions regularly during the 1970s, including after the Roe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=37.32s)]
*  decision in 1973, the Southern Baptists. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=42.44s)]
*  When Roe was handed down in 73, the former president of the Southern Baptist Convention [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=45.96s)]
*  welcomed it and explained why. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  He said, quote, I've always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=52.56s)]
*  life separate from its mother that it became an individual person. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  And it has always therefore seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=60.64s)]
*  should be allowed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=64.8s)]
*  Southern Baptist Convention. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Reactions to Roe versus Wade were also really heterogeneous for a long time between the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  two political parties. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=75.68s)]
*  There were plenty of anti-abortion Democrats and there were lots of pro-choice Republicans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=76.68s)]
*  Republican governors were at the forefront of decriminalizing abortion in the states [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  in the 1960s, including the governor of California, a man named Ronald Reagan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=87.2s)]
*  In 1967, Ronald Reagan signed into law the most liberal abortion rights bill in the country [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  in California. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=98.08s)]
*  So it's not that there was not disagreement over abortion or that there weren't strong [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=100.4s)]
*  feelings from various quarters about Roe versus Wade, but it was different. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  And it specifically wasn't really a politics issue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't an issue that swayed elections or that was a key part of the two parties' [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=112.04s)]
*  political platforms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  And contrary to popular belief, Roe versus Wade in 1973 did not spark some kind of immediate [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=118.28s)]
*  big backlash among conservatives and evangelicals and Republicans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=124.04s)]
*  It evolved differently. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=129.12s)]
*  And it's important to know that today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=130.4s)]
*  The anti-abortion movement as an explicitly political project, a movement married to the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=132.5s)]
*  Republican Party, that had to be deliberately created. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  It did not organically emerge. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=140.78s)]
*  And it actually did not happen until years after Roe was decided. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=142.56s)]
*  I mean, the influential right-wing pro-segregation religious leader, Jerry Falwell, his first [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=147.7s)]
*  anti-abortion sermon was not until 1978, more than five years after Roe. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=153.84s)]
*  Even as late as 1980, when Ronald Reagan by then was no longer governor of California, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=159.82s)]
*  he was running for president. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=163.84s)]
*  In August 1980, Reagan gave a speech to 10,000 cheering evangelicals in a Dallas arena. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=165.58s)]
*  And he talked about creationism and the Bible. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=171.06s)]
*  He talked about how evangelical institutions ought to be able to remain racially segregated [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  if they wanted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=179.02s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=180.02s)]
*  But even then, he did not mention abortion. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=181.02s)]
*  The plan to use abortion as a right-wing political organizing tool, to try, for example, to move [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=184.18s)]
*  Catholics to the Republican Party, to give a focal point, a policy focus, to right-wing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  Republican organizing against women's rights. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=196.58s)]
*  It was a choice for them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=201.54s)]
*  It was a project that did not emerge organically. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=203.44s)]
*  It was something they didn't really start working on in earnest until the 1980s. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, for example, he personally had to do a U-turn. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=210.3s)]
*  He had to repudiate the abortion rights bill that he had signed as a California governor [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=214.1s)]
*  when he became the first president to make opposition to abortion a central part of his [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=219.42s)]
*  political identity. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=223.54s)]
*  His personal transformation on this issue shows the political transformation that was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=225.08s)]
*  happening in the Republican Party on this issue, too. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=229.24s)]
*  Pretty soon, opposition to abortion would become effectively an entry requirement for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=233.1s)]
*  elected officials in the Republican Party. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=236.78s)]
*  And then pretty soon after that, anywhere Republicans had political power, they would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=239.34s)]
*  use it to attack abortion rights. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=242.6s)]
*  The states became laboratories for these policies. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=245.1s)]
*  It became almost mechanized over time that as soon as one Republican-controlled state [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=247.4s)]
*  would innovate and come up with some new way to restrict abortion rights, all the other [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=251.68s)]
*  Republican-controlled states would then follow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=255.24s)]
*  The most restrictive laws allowed to stand by the federal courts would then become the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=257.8s)]
*  template for all the other Republican-controlled states to try to enact those most restrictive [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=261.96s)]
*  rules, too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=266.32s)]
*  Wanting to ban abortion became not just the litmus test. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Question for Republican would be elected officials. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=271.2s)]
*  Over time, they made sure it was the litmus test for judges to be nominated by Republican [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=273.68s)]
*  presidents. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=279.32s)]
*  And at first, that was kind of tacit, like everybody knew it but nobody would admit to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=280.32s)]
*  it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=283.88s)]
*  A wink and a nod between Republican White Houses and conservative activists. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=284.88s)]
*  By 2016, though, Republican President Donald Trump just made it official. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=288.62s)]
*  He was known, obviously, for saying the quiet part out loud. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=293.14s)]
*  By 2016, he was flat out saying, and I will only nominate justices who will overturn Roe. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=296.56s)]
*  And he did. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  And so today we have the results of not just these justices ascending to the court. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  We have the result of a concerted political project that is attached to the Republican [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=310.86s)]
*  Party that started 40 years ago for political reasons. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=316.68s)]
*  And I know there's a lot to say about the court and the reasoning of today's ruling [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=321.8s)]
*  and the individual justices who did this and, indeed, the individual states and what their [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=327.12s)]
*  new laws are and how fast the curtain is coming down and we are going to do some of that over [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=331.68s)]
*  the course of this hour. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  But I think to know where we are and to know what's coming next here, we have to get real [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=336.4s)]
*  about who did this and how they did it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=341.26s)]
*  Because this is part of a political project. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  This is a 40 years in the making project for a big, well-staffed, well-funded, very radical [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=347.56s)]
*  project of the American political right and the Republican Party. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=354.64s)]
*  And I say it's very radical on purpose. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=359.0s)]
*  I mean that both in terms of its aims, we're seeing that today, but also in terms of its [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=361.32s)]
*  tactics. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=365.44s)]
*  It is impolite to say this, I know, but the anti-abortion wing of the conservative movement [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=366.44s)]
*  and the Republican Party has long had an armed wing, a terrorist wing that has killed a lot [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=370.96s)]
*  of Americans in the past few decades and set off a lot of bombs for terroristic purposes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=378.64s)]
*  And that is terrible and criminal, but it is undeniable that that is part of how the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=384.8s)]
*  extreme right has approached their role in this issue and how to get what they want on [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  this issue over these past 40 years. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=395.94s)]
*  That has existed alongside the well-staffed, well-funded, well-organized advocacy groups [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=398.54s)]
*  and think tanks and campus groups. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=403.74s)]
*  The anti-abortion political project of the Republican Party and the political right has [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=408.36s)]
*  been the central organizing principle for the right's entire effort around the judiciary, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=414.06s)]
*  one for which there is still no match or mirror on the left. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=419.14s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=423.3s)]
*  It's a big, now multi-generational, again, well-funded, tightly organized and extremely, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=424.3s)]
*  extremely militant American political project. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=429.82s)]
*  And I think what's important to see today is that for them, this is not a movement that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=432.94s)]
*  just got what it wanted and now will go away. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  This is a movement that they have been building for 40 years that is just now hitting its [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=441.36s)]
*  stride, that is just coming into maturity. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=446.86s)]
*  I mean, this is a movement that can claim six of the nine members of the Supreme Court. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=449.86s)]
*  We think of Chief Justice Roberts as the moderate justice among them, but you know what? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=456.86s)]
*  When he was nominated, part of his bio was that he was the spouse of the leader of an [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=461.58000000000004s)]
*  anti-abortion organization. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=465.38s)]
*  I mean, the anti-abortion political project of the American right is a way of life for [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=466.38s)]
*  people on the American right. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=471.7s)]
*  It is an industry. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=473.04s)]
*  It's an employer. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=474.04s)]
*  It's a big movement that has succeeded now as of today at the first top of the list thing [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=475.04s)]
*  they wanted to do. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=479.6s)]
*  Why do you think they would stop now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  Vice President Pence's immediate reaction when today's ruling came down was to crow [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=491.14000000000004s)]
*  about how we now need a nationwide abortion ban. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  Don't leave it to the states. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  Ban it nationwide. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today pointed right at that as what to expect next from [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=500.4s)]
*  them. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=505.26s)]
*  In the Congress, be aware of this, the Republicans are plotting a nationwide abortion ban. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  They cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress to do that, but that's their [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  goal. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  That's their goal. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=523.5799999999999s)]
*  This is where we are. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=526.96s)]
*  Of course, as long as a Democrat is president, any Democratic president would veto a nationwide [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=528.0600000000001s)]
*  abortion ban that was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress, but there's a presidential election [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=533.1800000000001s)]
*  around the corner. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=538.02s)]
*  Any Republican president would sign a nationwide abortion ban without hesitation. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=539.5s)]
*  That said, if we're being real about this, that question might be moot by the time we [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=545.34s)]
*  have an ex-Republican president, because there's nothing in the reasoning of today's opinion [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=549.7800000000001s)]
*  from these six justices that would stop them from accepting something like a fetal personhood [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=554.72s)]
*  case. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=560.0s)]
*  Fetal personhood, which is a concept that the right has been building in this political [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=561.6s)]
*  movement that they've built around the abortion issue, a fetal personhood case getting to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=566.44s)]
*  this court would give this court a path to not just let individual states ban abortion, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=570.2800000000001s)]
*  which is what they did today. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=576.36s)]
*  If they took a fetal personhood case, that could be their vehicle to impose a nationwide [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=577.82s)]
*  ban on abortion on the order of the United States Supreme Court. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=583.28s)]
*  One that would apply, yes, even in California, even in New York, everywhere. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=588.1s)]
*  And yes, that would be a radical thing for the Supreme Court to do. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=592.86s)]
*  But would it be that much more radical than what they've done today? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=598.02s)]
*  I mean, they've kind of broken the seal here, haven't they? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=600.78s)]
*  Roe was a 50-year-old precedent that had been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court itself multiple [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=603.18s)]
*  times. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=608.06s)]
*  That did not matter to them at all today. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=609.06s)]
*  Yesterday, they took a 111-year-old law on concealed weapons in New York. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=610.72s)]
*  111-year-old law. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  And threw that out, too. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=617.12s)]
*  I mean, what's the principle at work there? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=618.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=620.2s)]
*  States can't be trusted with the power to regulate concealed handguns, but they can [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=621.2s)]
*  force you to give birth to a child against your will. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=624.9000000000001s)]
*  111-year-old precedent, 150-year-old precedent. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=628.24s)]
*  What's the consistent principle between these two different rulings? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=632.08s)]
*  The only consistent principle between these two rulings in two days is that the conservatives [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=635.6s)]
*  have the power on this court, and they will now wield it however they want to achieve [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=640.06s)]
*  whatever outcomes they want, to change the country however they want without restriction, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=645.34s)]
*  and you must do what they say. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=650.26s)]
*  But again, I think it is helpful to not try to find some evolution in conservative jurisprudence [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=655.02s)]
*  here. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=660.5s)]
*  This isn't that kind of ruling. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=661.5s)]
*  This is a political project. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=663.0s)]
*  This is the culminating work of a concerted political project that defined this as a goal [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=665.0s)]
*  for the American political right and that put in place the people who would enact it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=669.74s)]
*  This is a very well-organized, well-staffed, well-funded, very committed, very radical, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=675.88s)]
*  in its prime movement that still sees it as a problem that the blue states are still going [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=680.26s)]
*  to have abortion rights. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=685.3s)]
*  I mean, overturning Roe today immediately effectuates outright bans on abortion in many [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=686.8s)]
*  states, and we're going to talk about that over the course of this hour. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=693.04s)]
*  But it also really does foreshadow a future case, perhaps quickly a future ruling, in [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=696.34s)]
*  which the Supreme Court will outright ban abortion themselves in every state. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=703.14s)]
*  And it is worth getting real about that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=707.98s)]
*  In the short run, we do now have abortion bans in effect in multiple states as of right [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  now because of today's ruling already. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=721.62s)]
*  We're going to be talking about that in more detail over the course of the hour. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=723.56s)]
*  One of the short-run consequences of that is not just that the number of states, but [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=727.78s)]
*  the actual number of buildings, the actual number of facilities in which an abortion [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=733.06s)]
*  legally can be provided in America has just shrunk radically. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=737.26s)]
*  The number of legal abortion providers in America has today radically contracted. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=741.4599999999999s)]
*  And that means the existing extant still-working abortion providers in this country now stand [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=746.68s)]
*  out more to the people who have been targeting them for decades. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=753.3s)]
*  It means that the people from the terroristic side of the anti-abortion movement will now [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=757.62s)]
*  have a smaller number of higher-profile targets to target. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=761.36s)]
*  We should take that seriously. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=766.5s)]
*  At a time when violence against abortion providers is already spiking, the providers who are [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  now left in the states where it is not banned yet, those providers are facing a lot of changes. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=772.88s)]
*  They're going to have to operate now with a higher volume of patients, people coming [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=781.96s)]
*  from further away, people therefore coming in later in their pregnancies, which means [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=785.48s)]
*  potentially more complicated procedures because of that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=789.46s)]
*  But they also are going to have to cope, on top of all that, they're going to have to [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=792.36s)]
*  cope with a higher threat environment than they are used to. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=796.12s)]
*  Because the anti-abortion movement, feeling its oats, really does have an armed terrorist [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=800.72s)]
*  wing that shoots people. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=806.1s)]
*  And that's been true for decades. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=807.98s)]
*  It has never been more crucial to protect abortion providers. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=810.24s)]
*  Justice Thomas today and his concurrent spelled out the rights that he wants thrown out next [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=820.36s)]
*  beyond abortion, now that they've taken care of Roe. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=824.38s)]
*  He wants Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell, in his words, reconsidered, which means he [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=827.08s)]
*  wants them overthrown. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=832.58s)]
*  Those three cases are about contraception, consensual sex between adults, and same-sex [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=834.58s)]
*  marriage, which means next on Clarence Thomas' list are to get rid of all of those things. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=839.46s)]
*  If you are in the same-sex marriage, this may be the time to start thinking about duplicative [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=844.96s)]
*  legal arrangements to protect you and your spouse, your family, your kids, your property, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=849.0600000000001s)]
*  your finances. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=854.4200000000001s)]
*  If this court moves quickly on Justice Thomas' list of what rights they're going to abolish [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=855.72s)]
*  next, being in a same-sex marriage now means there is a target on you from this court, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=861.1600000000001s)]
*  and this court has proven themselves to be absolutely unconstrained, not only by precedent, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=867.58s)]
*  not only by consistency with their previous reasoning, but by any concern for public opinion. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=872.96s)]
*  Take that seriously. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  Tactically, that notice from Justice Thomas today lining up all of those other rights [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=880.6s)]
*  he's ready to get rid of now next, I believe that will have a practical effect on this [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=886.84s)]
*  political movement from which he and his colleagues have emerged. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=891.84s)]
*  He's put out that list now, what they're going to go after next. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=894.74s)]
*  He put it in writing in his concurrence today. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=897.54s)]
*  Watch for action in response to that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=899.96s)]
*  Watch for people involved in this political movement to start teeing up cases to get them [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=902.18s)]
*  to Justice Thomas to get the job done on marriage rights. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=907.06s)]
*  Watch for a county clerk somewhere to refuse a license to a couple trying to get married [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=911.22s)]
*  in order to start court proceedings that would put marriage back in front of this court. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=916.18s)]
*  Watch for somebody who works at a health facility somewhere to refuse to process a prescription [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=921.38s)]
*  or an order for contraception, for an IUD, for the pill. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=925.76s)]
*  And again, to start litigation, to start legal proceedings which will eventually put access [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=930.12s)]
*  to contraception before this court. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=934.84s)]
*  They have asked for it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=936.84s)]
*  The movement they come from will give them that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=937.96s)]
*  Watch for Texas or another Republican controlled state to bring back its sodomy law to control [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=940.76s)]
*  with whom you are allowed to have sex and how. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=946.52s)]
*  They'll try to bring back that law. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=950.64s)]
*  The state will start legal proceedings that will eventually be designed to put sodomy [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=952.4399999999999s)]
*  laws back in front of this court. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  They have asked for it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  The movement they come from will give them that opportunity. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=959.4799999999999s)]
*  They are unconstrained in seeking to change the country in these ways. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=962.52s)]
*  I mean, for them, the dam is burst. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=966.76s)]
*  What do you see in their behavior that would give you any reason to believe that they see [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=970.64s)]
*  a reason to stop? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ_jKXcB87w&t=974.42s)]
