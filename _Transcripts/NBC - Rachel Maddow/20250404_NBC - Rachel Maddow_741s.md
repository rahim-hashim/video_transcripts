# The ridiculous real story behind the tariff plan that turned Donald Trump into a global disaster
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk)
*  Today, of course, you saw what happened in the markets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=0.0s)]
*  The Dow dropped more than 2,000 points today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  Not a typo. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=10.26s)]
*  Dow plunges 2,200 points. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=11.26s)]
*  Yesterday and today are the first time ever that the Dow has dropped 1,500 points or more [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=15.94s)]
*  on two consecutive days. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=21.48s)]
*  1,600 points yesterday, 2,200 points today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=23.7s)]
*  The S&P 500 dropped 10% in two days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=27.46s)]
*  It dropped 6% today alone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=31.32s)]
*  Just for context, whether or not you watch the markets, whether or not you have any money [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=34.9s)]
*  in the markets or retirement account or whatever, just to get a sense of the scale here, I'll [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=38.6s)]
*  give you two metrics here to get a sense of the scale. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=44.58s)]
*  The first one is the circuit breakers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=46.6s)]
*  Do you know about this? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=48.18s)]
*  The markets have circuit breakers that kick in when things go off a cliff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=49.66s)]
*  That's a mixed metaphor, but I think you know what I mean. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=54.34s)]
*  They call them trading curbs, and they're these shutoffs that kick in automatically [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=56.38s)]
*  and basically stop the market. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=61.8s)]
*  They stop people from trading for 15 minutes when things have gone unbelievably wrong. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=64.12s)]
*  And where those circuit breakers kick in, like the threshold of how bad it has to be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=71.36s)]
*  before the circuit breakers kick in, is when the S&P drops 7% from the previous day's close. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=75.76s)]
*  Today the S&P dropped 6%. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=84.36s)]
*  Had we got to 7%, we would have hit the circuit breaker. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=88.96s)]
*  They would have turned the lights out on the market to try to save us from ourselves. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=92.78s)]
*  That's one way to understand the severity of what's happened here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=97.36s)]
*  Here's another. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=102.16s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=103.16s)]
*  This is the VIX index, V-I-X. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=104.16s)]
*  Unlike the stock market graphs where you can tell things are bad when they go down, with [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=106.48s)]
*  the VIX, it's the volatility index. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=112.84s)]
*  It goes up when things are terrible. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=115.72s)]
*  It's like the economic crisis meter. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=117.86s)]
*  And you can see there are just a few big peaks there over time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  The first huge peak, that's 2008. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  That was the global financial disaster of 2008, the worst financial catastrophe since [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=126.48s)]
*  the Great Depression. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=130.6s)]
*  That's the first big peak. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=131.68s)]
*  The next big peak is March 2020. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=132.88s)]
*  That's the equally huge global disaster, right, when the COVID pandemic overran the world, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=136.36s)]
*  killed millions of people, and basically shut off economic activity like there had been [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=142.48s)]
*  a power outage. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=146.48s)]
*  So those are the first two big peaks there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=147.48s)]
*  But now look, new peak. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  That's now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  That's now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=156.0s)]
*  That one not caused by the biggest financial catastrophe since the Great Depression or [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=157.44s)]
*  a global pandemic that's killing millions of people. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=161.28s)]
*  That one caused simply by Donald Trump being president. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=163.66s)]
*  Again, with his great ideas. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=166.76s)]
*  And the scale of what he's doing, the scale of the destruction that he has wrought, is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  a little bit hard to get your head around. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=177.28s)]
*  I mean, like you can see the headline writers scrambling to try to find the right words [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=179.16s)]
*  tonight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=184.04s)]
*  I mean, here's the Wall Street Journal front page right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=185.04s)]
*  U.S. stocks plunged deeper, capping worst week since 2020, which again was the pandemic. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=187.8s)]
*  Trump's tariffs set off two-day sell-off as recessionary fears mount more than $6 trillion [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=194.0s)]
*  erased from market. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  This has been the lead analysis piece on CNBC.com all day. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=203.92s)]
*  Trump's tariffs, our biggest policy mistake in 95 years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=207.92s)]
*  This is the lead editorial today at the Financial Times, America's astonishing act of self-harm. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  But the picture of Trump there actually kind of puts a nice punctuation mark on that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=218.84s)]
*  Look what we've done to ourselves. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=224.0s)]
*  Hi. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=225.92s)]
*  But this is the lead. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  Quote, if it endures Donald Trump's decision on April 2nd, 2025 to enact sweeping tariffs [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=228.28s)]
*  on U.S. trade partners will go down as one of the greatest acts of self-harm in American [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=233.88s)]
*  economic history. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=239.32s)]
*  His actions will wreak untold damage on households, businesses and financial markets across the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  world, upending a global economic order that America benefited from and helped to create. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=246.16s)]
*  Elsewhere in the FT today, they describe Trump's actions as quote, strangely self-sabotaging, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=253.56s)]
*  quote economic lunacy that might seem better explained by psychologists than economists. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=259.44s)]
*  Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary says quote, this is to economics what creationism [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=266.64s)]
*  is to biology, what astrology is to astronomy, what RFK thought is to vaccine science. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=272.48s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal summarizes tonight, quote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average became [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=282.44s)]
*  the last of the three major financial indices to enter a correction, defined as a decline [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=287.08s)]
*  of 10 percent or more from a closing peak. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=292.88s)]
*  After today, the Dow is down 14.9 percent from its most recent high. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  The Nasdaq is now a bear market off 22.7 percent from its recent high. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  Anything more than 20 percent is considered a bear market. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  The Magnificent Seven stocks, which include Nvidia, Apple and Amazon, collectively lost [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=310.0s)]
*  $1.55 trillion in market capitalization this week. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=315.56s)]
*  That is a record. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=320.8s)]
*  Apple alone saw $443.5 billion in market value evaporate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=321.88s)]
*  I mean, it is hard to get your head around how much damage this one man can cause. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it's even harder to get your head around simultaneously the fact that he can [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=344.24s)]
*  do damage of this magnitude with such a teeny, tiny, teeny, teeny, tiny amount of thought. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=348.36s)]
*  You'd think it would take like a grand plan and some big brains to figure out how to destroy [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=357.47999999999996s)]
*  the economy of the richest nation on earth. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  But that's not how it's working out. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Turns out it doesn't take a big idea or a lot of big brains working together. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=367.84s)]
*  I know that this is this may be something that you remember, but just in case it's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=374.4s)]
*  not, I'm just going to put this back on the front page here just for a second, because [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  do you remember where Trump got the tariff thing from in the first place? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=382.67999999999995s)]
*  Do you remember like when and why and how we started talking about tariffs in the first place? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=386.48s)]
*  It was in his first campaign for president. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=392.48s)]
*  Trump didn't really have any formal economic advisors. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=395.48s)]
*  So he told his son-in-law, Jared, to find him an economic advisor. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=399.44s)]
*  Trump reportedly gave Jared some vague ideas of what his thoughts were on economic issues, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=404.96s)]
*  you know, something, something, make me look tough, China bad, something, something. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=409.52s)]
*  Jared then decided to find his father-in-law, a financial advisor for his presidential campaign [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=414.96s)]
*  by going on the Amazon.com website and starting to browse books. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=421.4s)]
*  Not like reading the books, because you can't do that on the Amazon website. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=428.76s)]
*  He was just looking at the covers, looking at the titles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=431.44s)]
*  And he found a book title that he thought was so cool. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=435.0s)]
*  The title was Death by China. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=438.32s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so cool. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=440.67999999999995s)]
*  That's so awesome. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=442.67999999999995s)]
*  And that apparently was it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=444.12s)]
*  This quote from Vanity Fair. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=445.48s)]
*  Trump gave Jared a summary of his views and then asked him to do some research. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=448.52000000000004s)]
*  Kushner simply went on Amazon, where he was struck by the title of one book, Death by [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=452.6s)]
*  China, co-authored by a man named Peter Navarro. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=457.44s)]
*  Jared then cold called Navarro, a well-known trade deficit hawk who agreed to join the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=460.6s)]
*  team as an economic advisor. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=466.36s)]
*  Navarro was a major advocate for an aggressive pro-tariff policy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=469.48s)]
*  Where did Peter Navarro get his idea that tariffs would be a good policy for America? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=474.48s)]
*  What was his backup for that conviction? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=480.28s)]
*  Well, he did have backup from a real expert, who he cited in at least a half dozen of his [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=482.96s)]
*  books, including the one that Jared found on Amazon that fateful day. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=490.64s)]
*  In all of his books, Peter Navarro has cited an economics expert to justify his views. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=496.04s)]
*  And the economics expert he cites is somebody named Ron Vera. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=501.72s)]
*  V-A-R-A. Ron Vera. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=505.92s)]
*  When Trump won the presidency and entered the White House, this Ron Vera started circulating [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=509.76000000000005s)]
*  a memo around Washington in support of Trump using tariffs in trade policy. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=514.4s)]
*  According to the New York Times, the memo had been, quote, sent from an email address [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=519.4s)]
*  purportedly belonging to Ron Vera. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=522.92s)]
*  At one point, Ron Vera wrote in the memo that Trump could, quote, ride the tariffs to victory. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk&t=525.8399999999999s)]
