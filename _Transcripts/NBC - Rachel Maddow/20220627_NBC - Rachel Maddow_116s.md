# Putin's Russia Preps For Political Stunt With Trial Of American Brittney Griner
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI)
*  It's been nearly four and a half months since WNBA star, two-time Olympic gold medalist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=0.0s)]
*  Brittany Greiner was arrested in Russia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=6.54s)]
*  She was arrested at a Moscow airport in February, just a week before Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=8.66s)]
*  The ridiculous charge for which she was arrested that Russian officials say they found traces [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=15.22s)]
*  of cannabis oil in empty vape cartridges in her luggage. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=21.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  They have laid patently ridiculous charges against her of large-scale drug trafficking [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=28.02s)]
*  for that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=33.28s)]
*  Today, for the first time since her arrest, we saw her in court. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=34.28s)]
*  Russian authorities are accusing her of smuggling a significant amount of a narcotic substance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=37.7s)]
*  We also learned today that her trial is going to begin this week on Friday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=43.46s)]
*  She's facing a prison sentence of up to 10 years. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=46.32s)]
*  And in terms of the court where these charges are going to be heard, fewer than 1 percent [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=48.96s)]
*  of defendants in Russian criminal cases in this kind of a court are acquitted. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  So it's sort of a chronicle of a conviction foretold. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=57.82s)]
*  On Friday in Washington, the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution calling for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=62.1s)]
*  her release. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=66.5s)]
*  The State Department put out a statement today saying, quote, the Russian Federation has [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=67.5s)]
*  wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Brittany Greiner. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=70.68s)]
*  We will continue to press for her release. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=73.86s)]
*  And while that is all well and good, in Washington, this is Putin's Russia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=78.1s)]
*  And in Putin's Russia, the reality is that Brittany Greiner is basically being held as [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=80.78s)]
*  an American hostage, and things are about to get much worse for her. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=84.52s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyi2CpXPJkI&t=89.16s)]
