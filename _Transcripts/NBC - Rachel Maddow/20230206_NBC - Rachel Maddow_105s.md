# Trump case 'cried out for federal investigation': Pomerantz
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0)
*  Now, one thing that happened when Tish James revealed the factual basis for that civil [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=0.0s)]
*  suit is that she referred it to SDNY. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  She referred it back to federal prosecutors at SDNY, suggesting that there's federal prosecution [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  to be done there along, given that fact pattern. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=12.14s)]
*  We have seen through public reporting and public revelations how much pressure main [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=15.56s)]
*  justice put on SDNY to let Trump off the hook, particularly on the hush money issue. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=19.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=24.68s)]
*  While Trump was president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=25.68s)]
*  Now, he's no longer president. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=26.68s)]
*  Do you believe that SDNY will ever do anything with this? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=28.64s)]
*  I haven't seen any reporting to indicate that there's an active investigation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=31.44s)]
*  As I mentioned in the book, this was a case that cried out for federal investigation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=37.1s)]
*  For all the reasons I talk about there and have alluded to here, I don't know why there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=44.1s)]
*  was never an intensive federal investigation of Donald Trump's finances. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=50.08s)]
*  The New York Times did their big expose in October of 2020 of Trump's tax returns. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=55.6s)]
*  I recall reading that and thinking to myself, well, this is going to start the feds on a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  substantial investigation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=68.76s)]
*  Maybe it did, and we never found out about it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=71.68s)]
*  But as I say, there's nothing to indicate that that investigation happened. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=75.2s)]
*  And one of the enduring mysteries, which I can't answer, is why it didn't happen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzfdxgG96e0&t=79.28s)]
