# Vindman: Ukraine Fighter Jet Hang-Up 'Pretty Absurd'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo)
*  I actually wanted to make some points on this military situation. This issue with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=0.0s)]
*  MiG-29s is pretty absurd. The fact that this is playing out in public is comical. Somebody [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=5.68s)]
*  should be able to pick up a phone or fly to Poland and resolve this issue and get Ukraine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  planes. Yes, this should have happened behind closed doors, obviously. But it didn't. And now [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=18.48s)]
*  we have to deal with the consequences. The consequences should not include Ukraine not [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=23.52s)]
*  getting these absolutely essential aircraft. There is a clear rationale. Ukraine needs them [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=28.08s)]
*  to defend their airspace against a violent, unprovoked attack. There isn't a real fear of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=32.8s)]
*  escalation. Andrei Kozlov, the guest that you had on, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=40.56s)]
*  wrote a really interesting and poignant thread on this, that the Russians are not suicidal. They're [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=45.84s)]
*  not interested in it. And I also need to tell you that this is an indication of really probably a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=50.8s)]
*  deeper issue with how this war is being managed by the White House and by the Pentagon to a [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=57.2s)]
*  certain extent. If this is the stuff that's playing out in public, it is not a good sign [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=64.0s)]
*  about what's going on behind closed doors. Yes, we've managed to get 17,000 missiles over to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=68.4s)]
*  Ukraine. Those are the Stingers and the anti-tank missiles. That's all true. But those are things [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=73.68s)]
*  that were already in the pipeline to a certain extent. Now we are facing new challenges, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  and we're just too slow to respond to this developing situation. Ukraine is not going to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=84.4s)]
*  be defeated. It's a question of how much people they lose, really. But they have the fortitude, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=89.68s)]
*  and now they have the missiles to defend themselves. They need more in order to avoid [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=95.68s)]
*  catastrophic civilian casualties. And that's in the form of these jets. That's in the form of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=100.4s)]
*  unmanned combat aerial vehicles. And I'll tell you that these estimates that 95 percent of Russia's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  combat power is intact are also way off the mark. I know that we are now just adjusting our [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=110.4s)]
*  mindsets to where we are and what's unfolding on the ground with the expectation that Ukraine was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  supposed to fold. But if you just do some back of the envelope math, 127 battalion tactical groups, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  about 70 combat vehicles, not talking about support vehicles, that's about 7,000, over 7,000 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=128.08s)]
*  vehicles. By OSINT, by people that monitor these things in the public domain, the Russians have [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=135.76s)]
*  lost more than 1,000 vehicles. That equates to much, much more than 5 percent. We just haven't [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=142.64s)]
*  caught up with the reality of how things are unfolding. We have a deliberate process. A lot [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=148.16s)]
*  of this stuff is satellite imagery to assess the battle damage assessment because we're not on the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  ground. But if you look in the open source community, you actually see a much, much more [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=157.04s)]
*  telling development. And it does not look as bad for Ukraine. It's just this is a painful, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=161.52s)]
*  drawn-out war. And we could do something to help bring it to an end before it escalates. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And we're not doing that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF2upxeyGUo&t=173.04000000000002s)]
