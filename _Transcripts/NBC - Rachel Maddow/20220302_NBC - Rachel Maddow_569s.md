# 'Good-Faith Basis' To Conclude Trump Engaged In Federal Crimes: January 6 Committee
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM)
*  All right, so big breaking news this evening from the January 6 investigation, and it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=0.0s)]
*  involves this man, John Eastman, an attorney for President Trump, seen here pumping up [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=4.96s)]
*  the crowd at Trump's big January the 6th rally just before the attack on the Capitol. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=9.94s)]
*  The January 6 investigation has described Eastman as a, quote, central player in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=14.88s)]
*  development of a legal strategy to justify a coup. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=19.72s)]
*  Now, Eastman infamously wrote that two memos for President Trump outlining what he described [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=23.64s)]
*  as a legal path for Vice President Mike Pence to toss out electoral votes from several states [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=28.68s)]
*  that Joe Biden had won and thereby handing the 2020 election to Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=34.04s)]
*  Eastman and Trump both repeatedly pressured Mike Pence to follow these plans, to toss [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=39.2s)]
*  out those electoral votes when it came time for him to preside over the certification [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=44.92s)]
*  of the election on January the 6th. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=49.44s)]
*  And of course, Pence, as we know, did not bow to the pressure campaign. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  The January 6 investigation naturally had a lot of questions for John Eastman. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=56.12s)]
*  But when they subpoenaed him, Eastman pled the fifth. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  He asserted his right not to incriminate himself under questioning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=64.82s)]
*  Politico called it, quote, an extraordinary assertion by someone who worked closely with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  Trump to attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=72.82s)]
*  Now, unable to get his testimony, as you can imagine, the January 6 investigation subpoenaed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=76.24s)]
*  John Eastman's records. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=81.12s)]
*  More importantly, his emails from his time working with Trump to overturn the election. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=82.68s)]
*  Mr. Eastman has been trying to block the investigation from getting those emails, claiming that he [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  was acting as Donald Trump's attorney and therefore his emails are protected by attorney [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  client privilege. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  Now, here is where things actually get interesting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Tonight, the January 6 investigation has filed a motion in court making its case for why [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=103.4s)]
*  those emails are actually not protected by attorney client privilege. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=108.88s)]
*  And what they're saying is that the attorney client privilege is void if what the lawyer [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  and the client are communicating about is doing something illegal or fraudulent. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=118.78s)]
*  Under the law, you and your lawyer can't just simply plan something illegal and then claim [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  attorney client privilege to shield all the evidence of that crime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=129.32s)]
*  And the January 6 investigation is now saying to the judge tonight, we believe Donald Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  and his lawyer, John Eastman, were engaged in crimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=138.94000000000003s)]
*  Let me read some of it for you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  This is from tonight's filing for the January 6 investigation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=144.94000000000003s)]
*  Evidence and information available to the committee establishes a good faith belief [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  that Mr. Trump and others may have engaged in criminal and or fraudulent acts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=152.22000000000003s)]
*  And that plaintiff's legal assistance was used in furtherance of those activities. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  The president sought to use the vice president to manipulate the results in his favor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=162.62s)]
*  Had this effort succeeded, the electoral count would have been obstructed, impeded, influenced [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=169.26s)]
*  and at the very least delayed all without any genuine legal justification and based [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=173.94s)]
*  on the false pretense that the election had been stolen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=179.66s)]
*  There is no genuine question that the president and plaintiff attempted to accomplish this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=183.1s)]
*  specific illegal result. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=188.38s)]
*  The select committee also has a good faith basis for concluding that the president and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=190.22s)]
*  members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=194.58s)]
*  interfering with the election certification process, disseminating false information about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=199.5s)]
*  election fraud and pressuring state officials to alter state election results and federal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=204.9s)]
*  officials to assist in that effort. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=210.34s)]
*  The conspirators also obstructed a lawful government function by pressuring the vice [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=213.14s)]
*  to violate his duty to count the electoral certificates presented from certain states. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  The apparent objective of these efforts was to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=222.72s)]
*  election and declare Donald Trump the winner. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=229.28s)]
*  In this way, the conspiracy aimed to obstruct and interfere with the proper functioning [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=232.24s)]
*  of the United States government. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=238.2s)]
*  So again, tonight, let's be clear about this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=240.16s)]
*  The January 6 investigation has gone to court to say that Donald Trump's lawyer can't claim [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=242.12s)]
*  attorney-client privilege for his communications because he and Trump and others on Trump's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  campaign were engaged in crimes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Barbara [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=258.56s)]
*  McQuade. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=261.92s)]
*  Last week, she published what she called a model prosecution memo analyzing actual potential [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=262.92s)]
*  charges against Donald Trump for his scheme to pressure Mike Pence to overturn the election. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=267.58s)]
*  And incredibly, the two crimes that she thought may have been committed are the two crimes [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=272.46s)]
*  the January 6 investigation names in this filing tonight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=278.02s)]
*  Conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=281.9s)]
*  Barb, it's great to have you with us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=286.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=287.9s)]
*  As the person who kind of, you know, I'm using this word here, predicted that these might [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=290.02s)]
*  be the statutes that Trump violated. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=294.42s)]
*  What's your reaction to this filing tonight and how significant is it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=297.26s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very significant filing because it's the first time the committee [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=301.18s)]
*  has said out loud what the crimes may have been and pulled together the evidence of what [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=305.42s)]
*  that crime may have looked like. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=310.98s)]
*  I think that any prosecutor who looked at that evidence in the way I did and the way [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=313.3s)]
*  that the former prosecutors who are leading this investigation for the January 6 committee [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=317.66s)]
*  are doing, it really jumps out as fairly obvious potential crimes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=321.7s)]
*  Now, of course, the details of the evidence matters here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=326.18s)]
*  But one of the things they do in this filing that I think is so significant is they document [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=329.34s)]
*  all of the evidence that they have that is beginning to come into focus that they've [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=334.14s)]
*  been gathering from all of these sources. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=338.06s)]
*  We know that because of some public statements that Donald Trump was pressuring Mike Pence [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=340.14s)]
*  to refuse to certify the election. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=344.94s)]
*  But I think some of the things that are coming into view are the hard part, which is showing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  that Donald Trump knew that it was false to say that he had won the election. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=350.98s)]
*  And they document and list all of that evidence in this filing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=357.18s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask you if you can lay that out for us a little bit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=360.1s)]
*  The investigation has told the federal court it has a good faith reason to believe Trump, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=363.46000000000004s)]
*  Eastman, and others have committed federal crimes. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=367.82s)]
*  Explain for us the case they lay out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  And do you think at this point it is a convincing one? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=376.98s)]
*  For either of these crimes, obstruction of an official proceeding or conspiracy to fraud [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=379.42s)]
*  the United States, each has slightly different elements. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=383.94s)]
*  But I think the key factor that has always appeared may be elusive is proving Donald [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=386.7s)]
*  Trump's intent that he knew that what he was saying was fraudulent. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=391.98s)]
*  When he was telling Mike Pence you should change the outcome of the election, that he [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  knew that was based on a lie and based on fraud. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=399.1s)]
*  And so they document all the ways that he knew that this was false. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=401.66s)]
*  I think the key factor is that he knew that was based on a lie and based on fraud. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=405.94s)]
*  And so they document all the ways that he knew that was based on a lie and based on [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=409.94s)]
*  a conspiracy to fraud the United States. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=413.5s)]
*  I think the key factor is that he knew that was based on a lie and based on fraud. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=415.5s)]
*  And so they document all the ways that he knew that was based on a lie and based on [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=419.5s)]
*  a conspiracy to fraud the United States. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=423.5s)]
*  I think the key factor is that he knew that was based on a lie and based on fraud. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=425.5s)]
*  And so they document all the ways that he knew that was based on a lie and based on [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=429.5s)]
*  that there was no fraud. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=433.82s)]
*  The one case that the Trump campaign won was on an unrelated issue relating to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=434.62s)]
*  affidavit. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=438.22s)]
*  Mounts to suggest that Donald Trump absolutely knew that there was no fraud here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=440.98s)]
*  In fact, one judge said there was not a scintilla of evidence that there is fraud. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=445.46s)]
*  You know, it's like, Amy, it's like there's an instruction that juries get about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=450.26s)]
*  willful blindness. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=454.06s)]
*  You can't turn a blind eye to something when it's highly probable that it's true. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=455.26s)]
*  If someone tells you that the world is round, you can't say the world is flat in [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  the face of repeated evidence that it is round. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=465.06s)]
*  If scientists tell you and they show you photos and you continue to persist that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=467.66s)]
*  the world is flat, at some point a jury will believe that you're lying. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=471.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=473.86s)]
*  And at the point, I guess the point you're making is that you can't just plead [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=474.1s)]
*  stupidity and ignorance and saying, I didn't know, despite the overwhelming [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=477.14s)]
*  evidence that was presented to you. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=480.1s)]
*  I want to ask you about another piece of the January 6th news tonight, because [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=481.94s)]
*  there's a member of the far right oath keepers militia who has just pled guilty [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  to seditious conspiracy in the attack on the Capitol, which in of itself is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=488.9s)]
*  pretty significant. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=493.26s)]
*  What does that mean and how big of a deal is it? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=494.46s)]
*  It's a very big deal, Aiman. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  I think, you know, seditious conspiracy is a charge that is used rarely because [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=499.82s)]
*  it requires not only a use of force to interfere with the government authority, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=503.94s)]
*  but it requires that it is the authority of the United States. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=508.41999999999996s)]
*  And so what they argued there in that case, the allegation was that they were [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=512.1s)]
*  using force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=516.78s)]
*  We now have a defendant in that group of oath keepers, 11, who says, yes, I did do [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=521.02s)]
*  this. And also importantly, he is cooperating. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=525.14s)]
*  And this particular defendant also was with Roger Stone on January 6th earlier [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=528.5s)]
*  that day. So his cooperation promises to be potentially very fruitful. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=533.22s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. Two significant developments today from the January 6th [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=537.86s)]
*  committee. Barbara McQuade is the former U.S. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=541.02s)]
*  attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=542.9s)]
*  Barbara, always a pleasure. Thank you so much. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=545.0999999999999s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your expertise tonight. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLa1bjn_dBM&t=547.26s)]
