# Mike Pence Script Change Seems To Address Fake Trump Elector Scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ)
*  First of all, I want you to see if you notice a pattern here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you something and I want to see if, see if you can sense some consistency [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=4.28s)]
*  over time here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=12.18s)]
*  I'm going to put a date stamp in the corner of the screen so you can see when all of these [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=14.38s)]
*  happened but see if you can pick up on the pattern among them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=18.78s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=23.78s)]
*  After ascertainment has been [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=25.540000000000003s)]
*  had that the certificates are authentic and correct in form, the tellers will count and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=26.220000000000002s)]
*  make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  After ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic and correct in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=38.120000000000005s)]

*  are authentic and correct in form, the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=48.32s)]
*  After ascertaining that certificates are regular, in form, and authentic, the tellers will announce the votes cast by the electors. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=56.0s)]
*  After ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic and correct in form, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=63.52s)]
*  the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=70.08s)]
*  After ascertainment has been had that certificates are authentic and correct in form, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=74.56s)]
*  the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=79.68s)]

*  the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=89.12s)]
*  Notice a theme? It's a script, right? It's always the same. Every four years, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=95.12s)]
*  whoever is acting as the president of the senate, whoever the vice president is, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=101.92s)]
*  it comes time every four years for them to open up and count all the electoral votes, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=106.16s)]
*  and it's always the same. I mean, with, you know, one or two little word shifts here and there, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=111.84s)]
*  it's always the same thing. After ascertaining that the certificates are authentic and correct, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=116.64s)]
*  the tellers will announce the votes cast by the elector. They say the exact same thing every four [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=121.28s)]
*  years. The words shift like a hair or two in either direction, but it's always the same. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=125.76s)]
*  Every four years until this last time, this last time for the first time ever started off just like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=130.32s)]
*  it always does, but then it careened off in a whole new direction. We've never heard before. Watch. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=137.68s)]
*  After ascertaining that the certificates are regular, informed and authentic, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  the tellers will announce the votes cast by the electors for each state, beginning with Alabama, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  which the parliamentarians advise me is the only certificate of vote [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=156.32s)]
*  from that state and purports to be a return from the state, and that has annexed to it a certificate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=160.56s)]
*  from an authority of that state purporting to appoint or ascertain electors. What was all that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=166.88s)]
*  at the end? All that stuff that the parliamentarian has advised you, that was all new. As far as we can [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=175.28s)]
*  tell, nothing like that has ever been said at any one of these things. But Mike Pence, when he opened [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=182.4s)]
*  the electoral votes January six last year, he added that whole new bit. The parliamentarian has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=188.56s)]
*  advised me there's only one document that counts as a certificate of vote from a state and that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=194.88s)]
*  certificate he says has annexed to it a certificate from an authority of that state. That's all new [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=200.88s)]
*  language that we've never heard before in this context. Vice presidents always say the exact same [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=207.52s)]
*  thing when it comes to time for them to announce the electoral college votes. But when Mike Pence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=212.72s)]
*  did it, he added this whole new complicated clause saying the parliamentarian had advised him that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=217.28s)]
*  only one certificate of electors could be counted from any one state. It had to have the explicit [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  blessing of an authority of that state. That was all new. And, you know, there's been some minor [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=230.56s)]
*  drama around the electoral college before in previous elections, but no vice president ever [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=238.32s)]
*  before felt the need to get a parliamentarian's ruling, basically giving him a clear legal way [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=243.36s)]
*  to assert that he doesn't have to count any forged fake set of electors that might have been sent [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  into him alongside the real ones. No vice president has ever before had to get some sort of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=256.16s)]
*  language from the parliamentarian explaining that if two sets of electors were sent in from [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  a particular state, he was only going to have to count the one. But Mike Pence had to do that, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=268.24s)]
*  which means vice president Mike Pence knew in advance of January 6th that Republicans in multiple [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=276.16s)]
*  states had sent in forged fake electoral votes, documents purporting to be the real electoral [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=281.6s)]
*  votes from those states, even though they were not real. We know he knew about it because we can see [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=287.12s)]
*  he had to maneuver in advance of actually conducting the vote count that day to get [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=293.36s)]
*  the parliamentarian to give him that language so he could justify not counting the fake votes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=298.0s)]
*  Reporter Kyle Cheney at politico.com gets credit for catching this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  and catching it at an at an auspicious time. It was 2 55 in the morning on on the night of January [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=309.84s)]
*  6 last year, 2 55 a.m. January 7th is the night after the Capitol had been attacked. Kyle Cheney [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=316.24s)]
*  that night made note of how Pence's language seemed to be different than all previous vice [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=322.24s)]
*  presidents had used for every previous electoral vote count. Mr. Cheney was totally right. It's [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=329.28s)]
*  totally obvious once you lay down what Pence said, all that extra verbiage that Pence added [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=334.96s)]
*  alongside the very austere, almost exactly unchanging language from all the other times [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=340.32s)]
*  the vice president has done the vote count in modern times. Reporter Kyle Cheney figured that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=346.4s)]
*  out based on the change language that Pence used, figured out that that that vice president Pence's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=351.28s)]
*  office must have worked with the Senate parliamentarian ahead of time to head off this stunt, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=356.08s)]
*  to head off this part of the plot, to head off what Republicans are trying to do sending in these [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=360.32s)]
*  forged electoral college votes, which they did in fact not just fill out and keep, they filled them [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=366.96s)]
*  out, signed them and sent them into the National Archives and to the United States Senate as if [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=374.24s)]
*  they were real. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPfcI9WYZzQ&t=379.6s)]
