# 'Genuinely shocking': Pro-Trump justices give presidential immunity case bad faith treatment
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY)
*  Let's talk about this. Let's talk about how it went Chris Hayes. Let me actually I got a lot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=0.0s)]
*  Start at the top well, I mean I I found it [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=8.86s)]
*  I guess sort of viscerally I found it one of those maybe a handful of moments over the last eight years that felt like [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=12.0s)]
*  Genuine vertigo like almost a physical sensation of like am I am I losing my mind here? Like what whoa? What's going on? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=16.64s)]
*  I saw there's something wrong about this and I was why did this sort of give this sense of distress? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  And I think the reason is this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=29.1s)]
*  Donald Trump's framing of this prosecution is that what is extraordinary about it is the fact of the prosecution [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=30.78s)]
*  Whereas the lower courts and the rest of us I believe that's what's extraordinary are the actions [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=36.9s)]
*  He took to warrant the prosecution. Hmm. What is unprecedented here are the actions at issue? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=41.14s)]
*  Which is the first attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power since the cannons fired at Fort Sumter not [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=46.3s)]
*  That an indictment was brought but from the very first moments the conserves in the court and in the framing of the question [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=52.22s)]
*  Adopted the notion that what is new here and extraordinary needs to be justification is the prosecution itself [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=58.38s)]
*  And in so doing what they did was as you said quite well [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=65.38s)]
*  adopted the most cynical sort of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=70.26s)]
*  authoritarian and and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=74.06s)]
*  Relativistic view of all this that Trump himself adopts which is well any prosecutor can prosecute anyone for anything [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=76.86s)]
*  Anyone and we saw this in the Colorado case as well [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=83.5s)]
*  This assumption that everyone below this court these austere gentlemen with their impeccable vision [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=87.42s)]
*  Everyone below them are political hacks [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=94.1s)]
*  Well the Colorado Supreme Court they just don't want Trump on the ballot and whatever red state court to kiss them off the ballot [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=95.78s)]
*  Then any prosecutor could prosecute anyone and what happens next a Democrat gets prosecuted by a Republican and all these political hacks everywhere [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  We are the only ones who clear see clearly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=106.62s)]
*  We don't trust all this other process happening beneath us the district court and the appellate court and the grand jury and the prosecutor and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=109.22s)]
*  Department of Justice and the Attorney General and the duly elected president who appointed him and the Colorado Supreme Court [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=116.08s)]
*  No, all of that. No, we get to say [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=120.52s)]
*  Never considering that they're the political hacks [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=124.12s)]
*  But the people who are actually engaging in regular order here are all these lower bodies that have produced this to this situation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=127.08s)]
*  And in so doing what it felt like was almost a philosophical endorsement of the worst aspects of Trump is yes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=133.4s)]
*  Which is that this is all just power politics by another name [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=140.96s)]
*  But none of this actually adheres to any sense set of regularity or rules of law that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=144.62s)]
*  The reason that this happens hasn't happened before is because there's never been as partisan a prosecutor as Jack Smith [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  But that's what's unprecedented here, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=156.74s)]
*  But it's not because of what he did and so to walk into the third branch of government and these people with all this power [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=159.06s)]
*  the creative minds who brought you 12 year old giving birth to her rapist child that to listen to these folks and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  Find them in the highest halls of power adopting the most authoritarian and cynical vision of this was a genuinely shocking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=172.78s)]
*  Lawrence O'Donnell. I want to go to you next and I will foreshadow. What's about to go here. What's about to happen here? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=181.28s)]
*  Katie was in the courtroom. Yeah, and heard the arguments Ari is a lawyer. Just like Katie [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  We're gonna make you guys go last and back clean up, but I'm feeling like I'm I have as much anxiety about this as you do [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=191.42s)]
*  Chris I want to go to you Lawrence because you are the man who usually does [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=197.5s)]
*  I would like you to throw cold water on my feelings. Well, no, I mean, you know, so [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=200.5s)]
*  There's no cause for alarm in any of this. God bless you my child as long as [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=206.18s)]
*  Joe Biden has reelected [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=212.02s)]
*  Because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=215.22s)]
*  If that was a given fact if he was running with say the 18-point lead in the polls that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=216.18s)]
*  Bill Clinton had at a certain point in his reelection campaign [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=222.58s)]
*  There would be a lot less nervousness about this because we would know [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=226.14s)]
*  Eventually this process will work and if they send it back to judge [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=228.94s)]
*  Chuck and judge cut can can actually have an evidentiary hearing and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=232.7s)]
*  Actually bring witnesses in in a way that she can't now and so there would then be some actual [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=236.66s)]
*  Under oath testimony about all this stuff before the election if they do that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  And then eventually you'd get through all this prosecution [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=248.26s)]
*  I actually think Joe Biden is going to be reelected [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=251.94s)]
*  So I'm not terribly concerned about what they're going to do in terms of slowing this thing down [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=254.18s)]
*  But what you saw the fundamentals of what you saw and what we discovered clearly today is that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=259.18s)]
*  There is a group on the Supreme Court [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=265.58s)]
*  Who believe that their duty is to protect the Constitution and the law and there's a possibly larger group [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=268.9s)]
*  Who believe their duty is to protect the president [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=276.78s)]
*  Not all presidents the president named Trump and that that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=281.5s)]
*  intensity [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  launches those fever dreams that we heard from Alito and Gorsuch about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  Every president now will make sure that their predecessor is prosecuted [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  They were adopting the Trump notion by the way, but this is a Biden prosecution [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  And and and that then the next administration will obviously [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=307.7s)]
*  Prosecute the previous president to do that. They had to completely ignore the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=312.62s)]
*  230 years of history that preceded the Donald Trump presidency that that all had to be ignored and they did willfully ignore [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=318.06s)]
*  And these are guys who pretend that they're not going to be able to do that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=324.82s)]
*  And so it was it was that tortured [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=328.7s)]
*  Process but what also emerged really clearly was not a single [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  Justice there bought the Trump argument. The Trump argument is not for selective immunity. It is for absolute immunity and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=337.26s)]
*  Every one of them [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=345.74s)]
*  Basically found a way of saying that's ridiculous and that's what they're doing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=347.5s)]
*  They're trying to get the president to do something that's not just a Trump argument [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=351.1s)]
*  Basically found a way of saying that's ridiculous and the Alito way [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=355.66s)]
*  Included that thing that you showed where he kept saying I'm not talking about these facts [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=360.18s)]
*  Now another the good side of that coin is these facts are so bad. I can't talk about them [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=364.74s)]
*  That's the good side of that. I think Thomas may be the exception [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=370.66s)]
*  I think Thomas may think all presidents are criminals and so all presidents need absolute. So that's the great miss everybody's like me [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  That's the great mystery [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=379.66s)]
*  He didn't recuse himself or maybe his definition of recusal is I will talk the least [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=380.62s)]
*  Clarence Thomas spoke only three times. He did not ask [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=386.38s)]
*  He didn't ask a paragraph worth of questions. The only thing he raised that was [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=390.3s)]
*  Outside of what anyone else mentioned was an issue that wasn't even before the court [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=395.86s)]
*  Which was the legitimacy of the appointment of Jack Smith? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=399.98s)]
*  That's not even before the court and Thomas asked about that. So he actually remains the most mysterious on the court today [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=403.66s)]
*  We don't know what he thought I think as Jenny was showing I think that we overthink them [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=409.78s)]
*  I think when you work for a president or you work for power, you know that they're just guys and girls and these particular guys [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  Consume all of this and I think what was clear today [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=422.17999999999995s)]
*  Popular media and they could they will direct quote segments for all of these programs [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  Alito gives speeches in front of conservatives and I'm sure that conservatives in the audience who don't watch any of our programs [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=430.5s)]
*  Are like he talking about chunks paragraphs from from all of your scripts. I have heard in Alito's rants. They are [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=436.66s)]
*  Bound to Trump in their feelings of being persecuted to a person [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=445.3s)]
*  Yes, and so in Trump's immunity claim which has myriad legal implications and layers to it [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=450.42s)]
*  They found common cause with the feeling of persecution and that is what they spoke to today [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=456.66s)]
*  That is where he found a receptive audience. What's amazing to me as a non-lawyer is it federal judge Carter out in California? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=462.5s)]
*  Was it was like the farther we get the more murky it gets but in the immediate aftermath Trump clearly committed the crimes and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=470.3s)]
*  Federal judges said more likely than not he committed felonies [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=478.46s)]
*  He and that Eastman guy and the further we get [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=481.7s)]
*  The more the people the highest levels of this branch that everyone said oh the courts held the courts held [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=484.7s)]
*  I think after today we have to get rid of that notion that the courts house and I think after today we have to get [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=490.06s)]
*  Rid of the notion that there's some complicated legal theory. They just they feel him they feel persecuted just like he does [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=495.06s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was a very dark day for the Supreme Court. I don't think [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=501.74s)]
*  The conservative justice has comported themselves well and to the extent that these arguments have a back-and-forth [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=508.18s)]
*  I'm not sure the other side for rule of law [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=513.42s)]
*  Moved it back enough [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=515.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=517.2199999999999s)]
*  I think this will matter in history because you're gonna study some of these precedents [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=517.74s)]
*  The last time we were all gathered here on a Supreme Court day [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=521.54s)]
*  It was the Colorado case and the reason legally not politics legally [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=524.06s)]
*  That experts would say that was unlikely to go against Trump was that there wasn't any precedent for booting him off the ballot [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=529.66s)]
*  Now we're gathered today. There's zero precedent [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=536.18s)]
*  For this kind of blanket immunity and there's anti-precedent [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=540.5s)]
*  Nixon and others taking pardons and and Robert Ray who replaced Ken star striking a deal with Bill Clinton on the understanding that otherwise he could be [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=544.42s)]
*  Prosecuted those are that's bipartisan examples. They're different party presidents and against all of that the test is okay [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=552.62s)]
*  Trump might not benefit as much but to the rules hold [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=560.9s)]
*  Based on the questioning and I agree with your caveat [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=563.86s)]
*  The rules did not hold for most of the conservative justices Justice Roberts has a slow grade [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  Scandal going he's got the money in the corruption on one side [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=573.7s)]
*  But he's also chief the chief justice overseeing an increasingly partisan MAGA court and he can't just stand idly by this is on him [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=576.54s)]
*  As well one more point. I did want to share that we didn't get to unofficial acts there can be [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=583.52s)]
*  potential official acts that would be harder to prosecute [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=589.94s)]
*  None of these are those [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=594.24s)]
*  Could happen when when you're dealing with war or when you order a drone strike and it kills someone abroad [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=597.12s)]
*  But it's unreviewable pardon authority, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=601.76s)]

*  The vice president of states who works for you and the speaker of the house is in the line of succession [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szWDP5CBtyY&t=639.36s)]
