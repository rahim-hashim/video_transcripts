# 'She popped him with a pin': Harris puncturing Trump bubble echoes Shapiro's winning strategy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw)
*  Let's just say, watching Josh Shapiro there, I mean, it's not like this is a minority view, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=0.0s)]
*  but I remember interviewing him as attorney general in Pennsylvania and thinking it was [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=4.04s)]
*  the same sort of feeling that I had the first time I interviewed Stacey Abrams, when she [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=8.96s)]
*  was the minority leader in the Georgia state legislature. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=11.88s)]
*  It was the first time I heard—it was the same feeling that I had the first time I saw [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=14.32s)]
*  you interview Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a congressional candidate on our air. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=18.04s)]
*  And there's just—there are just these people who you recognize, whatever their status is [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=23.36s)]
*  in the party right now, you just realize that the seal—there isn't a ceiling for them [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=30.2s)]
*  anyway. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=34.84s)]
*  And it's so—there's something weirdly gratifying about that 2022 race in Pennsylvania, because, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=35.84s)]
*  again, you go through these long periods in the Trump era of vertigo. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=42.4s)]
*  Nothing matters. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=47.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether you say crazy stuff, like, oh, it's like structural polarization [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=48.64s)]
*  overrides everything. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=52.44s)]
*  And then you get a race like that race between Doug Master and Josh Shapiro, where you're [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=53.44s)]
*  like, okay, okay, like, let's run the experiment here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=56.6s)]
*  It should really matter that this guy is able to communicate as effectively as he does, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=59.92s)]
*  that has the resume, is able to relate to people, and the guy running him against him [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=65.36s)]
*  is so extreme and so poor at those things. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=69.6s)]
*  And it did. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  One of those reminders in the Trump era, one of those elections—and there's been a bunch [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=74.88s)]
*  of them where, like, gravity exists. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=78.32s)]
*  Yes, it still matters in American politics. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=80.64s)]
*  Try to persuade people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=82.28s)]
*  Reach out to people that don't agree with you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=83.56s)]
*  Try to meet them halfway. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=85.52s)]
*  Do all the work of politics. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=87.0s)]
*  Still matters. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=89.32s)]
*  And that race to me was like a big example of that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=90.32s)]
*  Well, and what he did in Mastriano is—one of the political distinctions between the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=92.32s)]
*  Biden campaign approach and the Harris campaign approach to Trump is that Harris treats Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=96.96s)]
*  the way Shapiro treated Mastriano. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=102.88s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=105.56s)]
*  She popped him with a pin, and she's rolled out so many—and they all would have been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  there for Joe Biden, too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=112.44s)]
*  It's not about who they are and what they would mean for preserving democracy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=113.44s)]
*  It's just sort of a tactical thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=117.4s)]
*  But the Republican endorsements come every single day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=119.72s)]
*  And so she is now presenting to the whole country, coming out of her four weeks now, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=123.28s)]
*  as the coalition candidate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=129.24s)]
*  Shapiro ran against Mastriano that way, and he was so ostracized from the political center [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=130.52s)]
*  by the end from normal Republicans. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=135.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it's tactical in terms of how you position yourself. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=137.0s)]
*  But it is also something about being able to grab that energy and take it away from [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=141.44000000000003s)]
*  somebody who's getting attention, getting energy, getting all the cable news attention, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  getting all the stuff that they're getting, because they're being transgressive and crazy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=151.36s)]
*  And instead saying, no, we're going to expend our energy and our attention on something [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  that is not crazy, that is practical, and that has cross-party appeal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  It's very hard to do. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  And you can't necessarily prescribe to somebody how they can do it until you see them do it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=165.12s)]
*  But that is what Shapiro did to Mastriano, and it is the way that Harris has punctured [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=169.24s)]
*  Trump in this last few weeks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=174.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what's always striking when I watch Shapiro is the thoughtfulness through [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  which he answers questions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  You don't exactly know what he's going to say, and you know it's probably not on a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=181.68s)]
*  DNC talking point email. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  No offense to the DNC talking point email. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  He's speaking in a thoughtful, nuanced, everything's not black and white. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=190.32s)]
*  He doesn't fear answering questions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=195.6s)]
*  That's why I always lean in. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=198.24s)]
*  And some of the people you mentioned, Rachel, have that same quality. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=199.48s)]
*  And I was sitting there watching him and thinking, I wrote this down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=202.4s)]
*  Is that the Doug Bergen of our party? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=205.0s)]
*  I mean, he was the runner-up, right, for the vice presidential pick. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=206.64s)]
*  And it just shows you kind of the breadth and the bench of the party. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=210.36s)]
*  The last thing, and I'm glad Joy raised this, because just watching tonight, the diversity [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=214.12s)]
*  of the faces, the youth in the room, the diversity of people's backgrounds is so striking [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  and different from a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=225.08s)]
*  And what's also different is the overall message. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Biden and Harris are speaking to the totality of the country, the multicultural, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=230.68s)]
*  multi-ethnic country we live in that's diverse with a big umbrella and everybody who's a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=236.4s)]
*  part of it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=241.12s)]
*  And Trump and Vance speak to a tiny, tiny portion of the public. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's a striking thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=246.44s)]
*  You look at the room, but I think also in the messages we'll hear. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=247.48s)]
*  Richard, your first comment after listening to Governor Shapiro was referring to the question [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=250.24s)]
*  of what is their status in the party, their status in the party as of right now tonight [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=255.32s)]
*  is incredibly valuable campaigners for the Harris Walls ticket. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=260.4s)]
*  What this gives you is someone who can campaign for the ticket in Pennsylvania and get [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=268.04s)]
*  attention without the candidates having to be there, which is just as valuable as they can [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  possibly be. You have Raphael Warnock be able to do that in Georgia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=278.8s)]
*  You're going to see all of these people over the course of this week where we're just going to be [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  sitting here thinking, OK, 75 days of that guy campaigning in Pennsylvania or wherever [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=286.12s)]
*  their state is for this ticket. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=292.88s)]
*  Very powerful. I can't think of a more powerful group of surrogate campaign speakers that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=294.72s)]
*  the Democrats have had. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=300.72s)]
*  This is really an amazing lineup all across the country. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=302.16s)]
*  And you think about it's a very good point. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=305.6s)]
*  You think about how Josh Shapiro could sell out a room in lots of places other than [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=307.16s)]
*  Pennsylvania as a speaker on behalf of the Democratic campaign. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  As can Mark Kelly, as can Raphael Warnock, as can Gretchen Whitmer, as can a number of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=316.56s)]
*  people that we're going to hear from tonight. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  They don't have to be on the ticket. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  They don't have to be out of the cabinet. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  But the bench right now is as sort of electric as I've ever seen it in the Democratic [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=327.04s)]
*  Party. And to have that happening again in contrast to the Republicans at the same time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=331.84s)]
*  that you've got the entire living history of the party all on board, all represented [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  starting tonight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=341.79999999999995s)]
*  It's it's an enviable position, I think, for the party in terms of both tonight and for [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  their future. But we're going to see it showcased. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo0USRG71fw&t=346.84s)]
