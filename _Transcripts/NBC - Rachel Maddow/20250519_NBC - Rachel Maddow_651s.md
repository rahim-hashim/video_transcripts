Brian LaMarre, former National Weather Service meteorologist, discusses with Rachel Maddow.

# Deadly storms highlight concern about Trump's cuts to National Weather Service
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII)
*  Gail Davis was in her bedroom watching the news when the storms came through Friday afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=0.0s)]
*  And I looked and I seen all this debris mixing and I said, oh, we really, we really, we really, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=5.44s)]
*  we really in it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=10.4s)]
*  She saw the tornado come down her street and ran to the basement. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=11.48s)]
*  Everything was like, oh, just popping glass. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=15.68s)]
*  And I was so scared. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=18.68s)]
*  The tornado opened up the roof over the very bedroom she was just sitting in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=20.68s)]
*  Very scary story from that huge deadly tornado that struck the beautiful city of St. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  Louis on Friday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=32.92s)]
*  Seven people died in Missouri during Friday's severe weather. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=34.6s)]
*  The mayor of St. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=37.68s)]
*  Louis says the damage is estimated at more than one point six billion dollars in her city. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=38.36s)]
*  I'm sorry to say the city of St. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Louis is bracing for more storms tonight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=45.16s)]
*  These new storms are expected to be less severe, but a lot of rain and high winds is going to be [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=47.44s)]
*  dangerous in a city that is littered with loose debris like you see here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=54.24s)]
*  St. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=58.56s)]
*  Louis' mayor told MSNBC today that her city is definitely going to need federal help, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  including from FEMA, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=64.8s)]
*  FEMA has told St. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=67.84s)]
*  Louis that they'll have people from the agency, they'll have assessors on the ground in a couple [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=68.88s)]
*  of days by Wednesday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=75.44s)]
*  Hopefully that means St. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=78.4s)]
*  Louis will start getting some of the federal help it so obviously needs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=79.76s)]
*  But what's looming over this is of course that FEMA may not be at their best right now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  Earlier this month, the acting head of FEMA was fired and then immediately escorted out of the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  agency's headquarters for daring to say that the agency he was tasked with running should exist. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=94.64s)]
*  He was asked at a congressional hearing about Trump's desire to abolish FEMA. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  He said he didn't think that was a good idea, and so they fired him immediately and frog marched him [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=104.72s)]
*  out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=108.72s)]
*  The replacement head of FEMA has no background in emergency management at all. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=109.76s)]
*  He greeted his new staff by telling them he will quote, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=113.76s)]
*  run right over anyone who resists him at the agency. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=116.72s)]
*  He also told them to expect firings, expect layoffs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=121.2s)]
*  FEMA employees tell the Wall Street Journal the agency is months behind schedule in preparing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=125.76s)]
*  for hurricane season, which starts less than two weeks from now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  And it's not just the agency that responds to severe weather that's under strain right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=134.32s)]
*  It's also the agency that tells us what the weather is, that predicts and tracks and warns [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=138.72s)]
*  us about severe weather. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=143.6s)]
*  As tornadoes struck Missouri on Friday, very, very severe storms also battered Kentucky. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  One tornado in southeastern Kentucky killed 19 people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=151.04s)]
*  The government agency that provides weather data for every weather station and every weather app [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=155.44s)]
*  and sends out emergency alerts for all kinds of severe weather is the National Weather Service. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=161.84s)]
*  And the National Weather Service in Kentucky has three offices. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=165.84s)]
*  None of them is fully staffed because of Trump's cuts to the National Weather Service. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=170.56s)]
*  The office that handles forecasts for eastern Kentucky where Friday's tornado struck, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=176.56s)]
*  it's short seven staff members, which means that, among other things, the office no longer has an [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=180.96s)]
*  overnight staff at all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=187.76s)]
*  Because, again, obviously, we would hope that severe weather has the decency to only strike [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  during business hours. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=199.44s)]
*  At any of the three offices in Kentucky, there is no meteorologist in charge now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=202.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, we don't know if those staffing shortages in Kentucky had any effect on the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=209.76s)]
*  ability of the Weather Service to manage and predict and send out appropriate alerts about [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=213.6s)]
*  Friday's storms. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=217.6s)]
*  There's no reason to think that the Weather Service was anyway at fault for what happened in terms of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=218.4s)]
*  the devastating impact of those storms. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=223.28s)]
*  The agency says the Jackson office was staffed overnight for that one night on Friday because of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=225.6s)]
*  the expected severe weather. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=230.72s)]
*  Officials, including Kentucky's Democratic governor, say they've seen no evidence that the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=232.32s)]
*  Weather Service performance was impaired in this instance. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=235.92s)]
*  But even if it wasn't in this instance, these kinds of cuts just systematically reduce our ability [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=239.28s)]
*  to cope with something as inescapable and inevitable as severe weather. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=244.88s)]
*  And did I mention that hurricane season starts in two weeks? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=250.88s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the meteorologists the National Weather Service has just lost in recent [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=254.88s)]
*  months until less than three weeks ago, Brian Lamar served as the meteorologist in charge of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=260.88s)]
*  Tampa Bay Area Weather Forecast Office in Florida. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=266.24s)]
*  But as the Trump administration slashed staff at the Weather Service, Mr. Lamar accepted an early [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=268.88s)]
*  retirement at the end of last month. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=274.4s)]
*  Mr. Lamar, thank you very much for being here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=276.24s)]
*  I really appreciate you making the time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=278.24s)]
*  Hey, thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=280.24s)]
*  And I really appreciate all the highlight and spotlight you placed on the stories before the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=282.24s)]
*  lead-in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=286.8s)]
*  And the National Weather Service, as you know, and all the viewing audience knows, we're a public [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=287.44s)]
*  safety agency. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=291.28s)]
*  And especially as we go into severe weather season, which we're in now, hurricane season coming up in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=293.28s)]
*  two weeks, as you mentioned, it's so important to really understand more about the National Weather [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=297.28s)]
*  Service and make sure it has the support that it really needs moving into the future. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=302.08s)]
*  I feel like, I mean, I can't speak for everybody, but I don't know anybody in this country who [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=306.08s)]
*  doesn't have respect and admiration for the National Weather Service and their staff and the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=313.12s)]
*  service that they provide and the sort of creativity and diligence with which they have worked [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=320.56s)]
*  to always be at the cutting edge of what they do, to constantly be improving, constantly be [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=328.56s)]
*  improving not only their science, but also the way they communicate to the public about what's going [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=333.44s)]
*  on. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  I just don't know anybody who has a beef with the Weather Service at all. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=339.36s)]
*  That is making it very hard for me as a sort of political observer to understand that the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=342.64s)]
*  political observer to understand what percentage there is for anybody in the attacks on the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=347.84s)]
*  Weather Service and the gutting of the National Weather Service staff that we have seen from this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=355.84s)]
*  administration. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=360.4s)]
*  When this administration took over, did you foresee that it would mean large scale cuts to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  the agency? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=368.08s)]
*  No, I don't think it was a surprise to us. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  I think there's a plan out there, a 2025 plan that kind of outlined certain cuts that were going to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=373.76s)]
*  be proposed and enacted, and I think we're still working through that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=379.76s)]
*  But I think it's also important to really put things into perspective. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=383.36s)]
*  When I first started with the National Weather Service over 31 years ago, we were an agency that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  had about anywhere between 5,000 and 6,000 people, and we had over 250 offices across the country. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=392.0s)]
*  But over the years, we actually saw a downward trend in the staffing of the National Weather [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=399.12s)]
*  Service over the past, I'd say, 20 years. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  And we had over 250 offices, field offices across the country when I first started in the early [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  90s. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=413.12s)]
*  And we had a modernization of restructuring going on right when I joined the National Weather [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=413.92s)]
*  Service. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=418.0s)]
*  It was a very exciting time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=418.24s)]
*  And we actually had tremendous support from Congress in terms of additional funding, a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=420.0s)]
*  significant investment from the American people into the National Weather Service. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=425.84s)]
*  We saw Doppler radars that were fielded across the country. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=430.4s)]
*  We saw new science and technology, and we hired a lot of people in the National Weather Service. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=433.28s)]
*  But we actually consolidated from over 250 offices to about our current 122 offices that we have in [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  place right now. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=446.32s)]
*  And the men and women that serve in the National Weather Service, I can't think of a more dedicated [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=447.12s)]
*  group. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  I really liken the group of people, their dedication to, say, like law enforcement, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=452.0s)]
*  firefighters, the medical community. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=456.48s)]
*  It is a 24-7, 365-day job. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=458.48s)]
*  And it's a passion, because as public servants, the National Weather Service employees, and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=462.56s)]
*  throughout my career, like I said, over 30 years, it's really been about how can we help other [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=468.72s)]
*  people make decisions when severe weather strikes? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=475.2s)]
*  What are you most worried about, Brian, in terms of the cuts? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=479.28s)]
*  We've got offices that don't have staffing overnight. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=482.4s)]
*  We've got multiple offices that have no meteorologist in charge. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=486.08s)]
*  We've got mass firings of probationary workers, young hires in their first, in many cases, first [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=490.56s)]
*  year or two on the job. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=495.92s)]
*  What do you think the public should be aware of in terms of what's most dangerous in those changes? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=497.36s)]
*  I think you mentioned a couple of them right there, Rachel, in terms of the terminations of the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  probationary employees, because that's your lifeblood. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=506.8s)]
*  That's the future of the agency. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the new generation. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=511.04s)]
*  Those are the wonderful, young, innovative minds that are coming out of college. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=512.1600000000001s)]
*  They're also wanting to come into the National Weather Service from broadcast media, from the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=516.4s)]
*  military, from private sector. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=520.48s)]
*  And that's really the future of the agency. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=522.4s)]
*  So I think that's one significant impact right there, because there was so much innovation and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=524.48s)]
*  talent that was actually helping this agency modernize and go through what we call a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=529.12s)]
*  transformation in the National Weather Service. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  But I think what worries me most is really the hiring freeze and the lack of significant [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=535.92s)]
*  investment that we're looking at in the National Weather Service. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  So I would think for everyone listening tonight, it's really about focusing more on additional [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  resources needed for the National Weather Service. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  Like I said, over 30 years ago, we were going through a modernization restructuring. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=553.36s)]
*  We actually downsized a number of offices, but we increased our technology. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=557.04s)]
*  We added more meteorologists and hydrologists, electronics technicians, admin support. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=561.2s)]
*  It takes everyone. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=566.8s)]
*  It's not just about the meteorology. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=567.68s)]
*  It's about the entire scientific spectrum. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=569.6s)]
*  And you may have heard of the phrase an integrated warning team. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what the National Weather Service has a foundation with. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=576.32s)]
*  And that's really going to be the National Weather Service, our core partners in emergency [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=579.04s)]
*  management, and also the media. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=583.28s)]
*  The three groups work together to help people protect themselves. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=585.6s)]
*  And as we saw over the past three days, killer tornado outbreaks across significant portions [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=589.84s)]
*  of the country. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=595.12s)]
*  You mentioned earlier there's severe weather going on as we speak. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=595.6s)]
*  And as we approach the hurricane season, we really have to make sure that everyone is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  prepared. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=603.2s)]
*  And if we start seeing additional cuts, then that's really going to be starting to chip [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  away at that preparedness across the country. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=609.36s)]
*  Brian Lamar, former meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service Forecast Office [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  in Tampa Bay, Florida. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  Thank you for your years of government service. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=618.32s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand this tonight, Brian. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=622.24s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=623.84s)]

*  All right. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=625.36s)]
*  More news ahead here tonight. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hqH9dfOII&t=625.7600000000001s)]
