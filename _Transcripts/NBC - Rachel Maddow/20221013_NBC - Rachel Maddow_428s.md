# 'What Kind Of Snowflake Is Donald Trump?': Raskin Calls Out Trump To Answer Subpoena
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM)
*  Joining us now is Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of the January 6 investigation. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=3.24s)]
*  Sir, thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=5.24s)]
*  I know today was a big day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=6.92s)]
*  Thank you very much, Rachel. It's great to be with you and Alex and Ari and Joy and who... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  I can't see you guys, but I know there's a big group. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=16.36s)]
*  Nicole's here, too. A cast of thousands. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=18.36s)]
*  When you highlighted today those resignations, I thought in that moment [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=21.72s)]
*  that that was arguably the first accountability for Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  The White House resignations that happened immediately on the occasion of January 6 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=29.92s)]
*  from people who are close enough to him to see his behavior. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Then today we got the latest accountability. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=38.6s)]
*  You and the committee voting unanimously to send him a subpoena for documents [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=40.68s)]
*  and sworn testimony related to these events. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  What... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Is there a sort of number line of accountability here that you have in mind [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  in terms of thinking what he has to answer for and how he ought to answer for it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=53.6s)]
*  What are you trying to uncover that we don't already know by issuing him this subpoena? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, we... [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  You know, we've talked to more than a thousand Americans about this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=65.32s)]
*  We've seen vast cooperation from people in the Trump administration, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  people in the Trump cabinet, people in the Trump family even have come forward, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=75.84s)]
*  people all up and down the government, people in the streets, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=80.6s)]
*  Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, you name it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=84.28s)]
*  People have come forward to participate, to try to establish some kind of accountability [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=86.92s)]
*  and reckoning for this nightmare that took place against our country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=92.2s)]
*  One would think that a former president of the United States would step forward [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  in order to volunteer his participation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=101.08s)]
*  I mean, if somebody accused you, Rachel, of trying to overthrow the government or topple an election, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=104.36s)]
*  I think you would probably be the first person to say, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=111.0s)]
*  no, I want to come and testify about that and clear up the record. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Or alternatively, if you did it and you're proud of it, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=116.96s)]
*  well, then come forward and testify about, you know, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=120.72s)]
*  why you think you are the new Mussolini leading a right-wing movement to overturn our government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=123.8s)]
*  But have something to say. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  You're certainly willing to go out and talk to the crowds that show up for your rallies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=132.28s)]
*  Why won't you talk to the United States Congress when you have a legal obligation to do so? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=138.28s)]
*  And I would think a patriotic duty to meet as well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  We spoke today with the brother of Officer Brian Sicknick, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=147.4s)]
*  one of the officers who gave his life defending the Capitol. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  And his brother told us today that he was surprised and pleased by the vote of the committee [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  to get Trump to testify, to try to compel his testimony with a subpoena. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  He also told us he doesn't expect that Trump ever will have to testify. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=164.36s)]
*  Told us I'm not holding my breath. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=167.88s)]
*  He's glad that you're trying, but he doesn't expect it will ever come to fruition. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=169.24s)]
*  What would you say to Officer Sicknick's brother and to other Americans who are wondering what this means [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=173.2s)]
*  in practical terms, if this means that Trump ever will be sworn in and compelled to talk? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=178.32s)]
*  Well, first, I would thank Brian and I would thank his mom who is there today. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=185.8s)]
*  Mrs. Sicknick was there and I know there were other members of the family and friends as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=190.4s)]
*  And I want to thank so many of the families of officers who suffered through this, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  who've hung tough with us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=202.68s)]
*  And it means a lot to the members of the committee and to our staff. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  But I would say this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  What kind of snowflake is Donald Trump that he's willing to send hundreds and hundreds of other people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  to go and do his battle and to attack police officers with Trump flags and Confederate battle flags [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=217.52s)]
*  and turn American flags into weapons. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  And he's very happy to do that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=228.28s)]
*  And he won't even come and explain himself why he thought he had a right to do that or why he thought [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=230.44s)]
*  that was the right thing to do. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=236.44s)]
*  What is he afraid of? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=237.72s)]
*  One thing he might be afraid of, of course, is that under the Fifth Amendment privilege against [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  the Supreme Court has determined that in a criminal trial, the prosecutors cannot comment on someone's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=245.36s)]
*  failure to testify, much less draw an adverse inference from it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  You can't even mention it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=257.2s)]
*  And that's grounds for mistrial. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=258.52s)]
*  But in a civil proceeding, the Supreme Court has found unanimously and this is Justice Scalia's big commitment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=260.24s)]
*  He was the one always writing these decisions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=267.68s)]
*  He said, if you don't show up for a civil proceeding, it's perfectly fine for that not only to be mentioned [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=269.48s)]
*  and talked about, but used against you and for to be the basis for drawing an adverse inference. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=276.4s)]
*  So if Donald Trump wants the entire country to draw the most negative adverse inferences from his not showing up, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=283.0s)]
*  well, he's free to do that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=292.2s)]
*  But at that point, also, the committee can say if there are any remaining gaps or conflicts or ambiguities in the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=293.8s)]
*  testimony, we're going to resolve it against him because, as Scalia would say, he has every incentive and motivation [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=301.56s)]
*  to show up. And if he doesn't do so, he's basically confessing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  And you can say that in the civil context, whereas you could never say it in the criminal context. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=313.04s)]
*  In terms of the mechanics of how the subpoena would be enforced, can you just tell us the next steps? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  We saw the committee vote live on TV today. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=322.6s)]
*  Can the committee do this on its own? Does it now go to the full House? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=325.72s)]
*  How does this how does this work out? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=328.6s)]
*  And at what point does it eventually end up in court? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, the committee can act. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=335.68s)]
*  It will go through the House of Representatives and then we have the right to issue the subpoena, as we've done for [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=337.72s)]
*  lots of other people like Scavino and Navarro and Steve Bannon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=343.88s)]
*  And Steve Bannon, of course, has been criminally convicted of contempt of Congress for just blowing off the subpoena. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=348.92s)]
*  So I don't recommend that to the former president or to the moms and dads of the country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=357.36s)]
*  If you know, if your kid gets a subpoena, that is something that you can't just hide under the couch, you know, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  that's something you've got to respond to. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  So I look, we we have every reason to believe that he will come forward the way that the vast majority of patriotic [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  Americans have come forward. If he doesn't, well, then obviously that creates a different set of problems. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=381.16s)]
*  And we don't have a lot of time to act on it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=385.72s)]
*  But there are criminal ways of enforcing subpoenas. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=388.6s)]
*  There are civil ways of enforcing subpoenas. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=391.8s)]
*  And then also we have the inherent powers of Congress to enforce a subpoena. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly throughout our history that Congress has the authority to enforce its own subpoenas, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=399.84s)]
*  as if we are a court ourselves. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efJUwu1YKaM&t=406.64s)]
