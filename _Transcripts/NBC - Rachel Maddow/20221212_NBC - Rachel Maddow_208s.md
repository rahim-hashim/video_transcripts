# Why 'Obstructing An Official Proceeding' Is Important To Keep An Eye On
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8)
*  But here's something to keep an eye on when it comes to charges against January 6th defendants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=0.0s)]
*  When you had those convictions of the oath keepers on seditious conspiracy, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=6.68s)]
*  That's the headline charge that got all the most attention and for good reason. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=12.32s)]
*  But when you got those seditious conspiracy convictions of two members of the oath keepers, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=16.36s)]
*  you should know that those two members of the oath keepers and also all of the other [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=21.44s)]
*  charged in that same trial, they were all also convicted of a different felony, obstructing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=25.72s)]
*  an official proceeding. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=32.64s)]
*  In other words, they were convicted of a felony charge for preventing Congress or trying to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=35.04s)]
*  prevent Congress from doing its job that day, which was certifying the presidential election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=39.48s)]
*  And that charge obstructing an official proceeding, that hasn't just been used against these [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  organized paramilitary groups like the oath keepers. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=50.28s)]
*  About 300 different defendants from January 6th have been charged under that specific [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=53.76s)]
*  felony statute, obstruction of an official proceeding. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=59.68s)]
*  That specific statute, obstruction of an official proceeding, it has also been seen by many [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=63.32s)]
*  legal experts as one of the most likely felony charges that could be brought against Donald [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=67.76s)]
*  Trump himself if he were ever to be charged personally in connection with the January [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=74.44s)]
*  6th attack. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=79.2s)]
*  That's why it's worth sort of memorizing that phrase, obstruction of an official proceeding. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=81.92s)]
*  It's worth keeping an eye on that as a specific felony charge that has again been used hundreds [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=86.6s)]
*  of times and has been used to get hundreds of convictions thus far against January 6th [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=91.64s)]
*  defendants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=98.28s)]
*  Because in a Washington, D.C. federal appeals court today, a panel of three federal appeals [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=99.56s)]
*  court judges started considering whether that specific charge should essentially be nullified [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=104.64s)]
*  when it comes to January 6th, whether it shouldn't be allowed to use that charge against [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=110.12s)]
*  January 6th defendants. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=115.08s)]
*  At a lower level, at the district court level, in the federal court system in D.C., there's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=117.68s)]
*  one Trump appointed judge who has ruled that that felony charge, that obstruction of an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  official proceeding charge, can't be used against January 6th defendants. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Lots of other judges, including judges in that same federal court, in that same D.C. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=131.56s)]
*  district court, have said it's fine to use that charge. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=136.4s)]
*  And in fact, I've overseen trials in which it has been used and it has been used to secure [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=139.12s)]
*  convictions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=143.76s)]
*  But there is this one Trump judge who says it shouldn't be used. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=144.76s)]
*  And when that Trump appointed judge ruled that way, the Justice Department appealed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=148.72s)]
*  And so today it was the next highest level of court. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=154.08s)]
*  It was a federal appeals court, the D.C. circuit court of appeals, which heard oral arguments [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=156.08s)]
*  on whether or not that specific felony charge can essentially be obviated for January 6th [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=160.16s)]
*  defendants. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=166.8s)]
*  And that has very wide consequences for everybody all the way down the line, not only people [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  who have already been convicted of that charge, but people who are facing charges on that, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  facing that felony charge. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  And potentially, the consideration of whether or not a charge like that might be used against [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=179.68s)]
*  people who are at the very top of the alleged conspiracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0OhaBi6s8&t=184.66000000000003s)]
