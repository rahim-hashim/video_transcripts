# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 11
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY)
*  Now, I mentioned there might be more videotape tomorrow than we were otherwise expecting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=0.0s)]
*  for your typical criminal conspiracy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=6.2s)]
*  Part of the reason I think we should be sort of ready for that tomorrow is because of this, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=9.6s)]
*  which we recently saw from the New York Times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=15.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So what time is the whole political presidential situation happening that day with Pence? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  That I don't know. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I guess we're just going to have to... [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  A lot of the questions are coming in about DC. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=27.8s)]
*  We still haven't formulated a plan for DC yet because we've been trying to formulate... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=29.8s)]
*  We somewhat know. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=34.0s)]
*  We just... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=35.0s)]
*  There's a lot of detailed information that I guess we got to go over. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=36.0s)]
*  But yes, we will have a plan for DC. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=39.4s)]
*  Why is there a tape of that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=43.0s)]
*  Apparently, the Proud Boys, pro-Trump paramilitary group, recorded their video conference calls, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=45.8s)]
*  which is the venue they chose for making their plans for Washington, DC on January 6th. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=53.4s)]
*  The plan for the whole political presidential situation happening that day with Pence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=59.6s)]
*  This is the part where Stringer Bell says, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=66.0s)]
*  Are you taking notes on a freaking criminal conspiracy? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=67.8s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=71.0s)]
*  I mean, I have no advanced knowledge as to what the January 6th investigators have gotten, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=73.0s)]
*  what they don't. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=77.4s)]
*  But Alan Foer at the New York Times reported last month that the Proud Boys paramilitary group [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=78.0s)]
*  not only recorded their video planning sessions for January 6th, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=84.0s)]
*  but at least one of the recordings was seized from the phone of the group's leader by the FBI this year in 2022. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=88.0s)]
*  Quote, And a copy was recently obtained by the Times. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=97.4s)]
*  So these big brains in this pro-Trump fascist group, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=100.4s)]
*  first of all, decided to do their organizing on video conference. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=104.6s)]
*  Then they made recordings of those planning sessions, which is amazing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=108.6s)]
*  Then their leader guy kept the recordings for at least a year after the Capitol attack. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  He then had them seized by the FBI. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=124.6s)]
*  And also they have made their way to at least one reporter who was able to publish pieces of them at the New York Times. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=128.6s)]
*  So, yeah, like I said, I don't know exactly what the January 6th investigation has, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=135.2s)]
*  but it's got to be a help to have guys like this right in the middle of your criminal conspiracy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=139.4s)]
*  I mean, you pray in investigations of all kinds for targets like this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Did you literally leave breadcrumbs too? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's why the leadership of both of these pro-Trump armed fascist groups are about to be put on trial for sedition. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=154.0s)]
*  Part of the way you're able to put somebody on trial for a crime that serious is when they lay out and make records of everything they've done. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=160.4s)]
*  AR-15s, shotguns, tons of pistols, semi-automatic handguns, also bear spray, chemical spray, stun guns, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=172.0s)]
*  flagpoles, spears, flagpoles made into spears, clubs, collapsible batons, bulletproof vests, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=181.4s)]
*  crossbows, machetes, smoke grenades, thousands of rounds of ammunition ranging from shotgun shells to hollow point bullets. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=189.4s)]
*  Plus the nightmare homemade stuff like these mason jars filled with gasoline and styrofoam. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=197.4s)]
*  Basically do-it-yourself napalm. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=203.4s)]
*  Nice that he packed them all together in that tight space. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=206.4s)]
*  Hit any speed bumps on the way? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=210.4s)]
*  On Friday, just a few days ago, the Washington Post did a public service. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=214.4s)]
*  They set several reporters to pull from court filings and public reporting all of the different weapons we now know were at the Capitol on January 6th in the hands of the pro-Trump mob. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=219.4s)]
*  The Post reported on 121 people ultimately charged with using or carrying dangerous weapons that day. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=231.4s)]
*  That reporting of course follows testimony from White House Staffer Cassidy Hutchinson that not only was President Trump warned early on January 6th that the crowds near the Capitol were quite heavily armed, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=237.4s)]
*  that the people choosing to go through the metal detectors had had tons of weapons confiscated from them already, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=247.4s)]
*  but he was warned that the people choosing not to go through the metal detectors were choosing to avoid them, choosing to avoid going through magnetometers in part because they wanted to keep their weapons on them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=252.4s)]
*  Trump responded to that information, allegedly, by saying that he wanted the metal detectors for his rally taken down so the crowd wouldn't have to have their guns taken away for them to be able to attend. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=263.4s)]
*  Because whoever they wanted to use those weapons against, he figured it wasn't him. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=275.4s)]
*  They're not here to hurt me. Let the people in with weapons and then we'll go to the Capitol. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=292.4s)]
*  Again, we have known that information for a couple of weeks because of testimony from White House Staffer Cassidy Hutchinson. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=298.4s)]
*  But that information we can now put in the context of a whole burst of new news about just how armed the crowd was on January 6th. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=305.4s)]
*  I mean, first we learned from her that Trump knew they were armed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=314.4s)]
*  Now we're learning a lot more about how exactly they were armed and how armed they were. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=318.4s)]
*  I mean, in addition to that Washington Post reporting, which is a real public service, on Friday from the Justice Department, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=324.4s)]
*  we also got an update in the seditious conspiracy case against the leaders of the Oath Keepers and alleged members of that group. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=330.4s)]
*  U.S. prosecutors laid out a series of revelations about weapons they say those individuals had brought with them to D.C. on January 6th. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=337.4s)]
*  Quote, the government has evidence that members of the group from Florida and Arizona allegedly staged semi-automatic rifles and other weapons in a suburban Washington hotel. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=344.4s)]
*  While a third team from North Carolina kept their firearms ready to go in a vehicle in the parking lot, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=354.4s)]
*  another Florida member of the group came to Washington with explosives in his recreational vehicle, which he left parked in College Park, Maryland. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=358.4s)]
*  The government later seized from that RV, quote, military ordnance grenades. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=367.4s)]
*  He had them in his RV, which he had used to travel to D.C. on January 6th. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=374.4s)]
*  All of that is information, I think it's worth noting, that is all information we did not have. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=379.4s)]
*  The first time anybody tried to hold Trump accountable for what he set off on January 6th. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=384.4s)]
*  During his second impeachment trial right after January 6th, one of the key pieces we now know was missing was just how armed that crowd was when they stormed the Capitol. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=390.4s)]
*  That makes this kind of fresh new ground. How does it change the job of the investigators? How does it change the stakes? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=400.4s)]
*  Well, joining us now is somebody in a unique position to be able to talk about that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=407.4s)]
*  Barry Burke was counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during President Trump's first impeachment, the one about Ukraine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=412.4s)]
*  Then he was lead counsel in President Trump's second impeachment, which was the one about January 6th. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=417.4s)]
*  Mr. Burke, it is a real pleasure to have you with us here tonight. Thank you for taking the time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=422.4s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. Great to be here. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=426.4s)]
*  Is it fair to say that when Trump was impeached for the January 6th attack, again, for which you were lead counsel, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=428.4s)]
*  is it fair to say that it wasn't yet clear at that time just how many weapons were among the mob that day, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=434.4s)]
*  how many weapons, what types of weapons they had brought to D.C., let alone the fact that Trump was aware of how armed they were? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=442.4s)]
*  That is all true. This is so much more direct evidence that supports everything we were saying during the impeachment seeking to prove [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=449.4s)]
*  and all the circumstantial evidence that we thought proved it. It also shows the lies to all of Trump's defenses. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=457.4s)]
*  If you remember, during the impeachment, we had him saying to the Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=461.4s)]
*  We had him sending out on December 19th the tweet, you know, big protest to Washington, D.C. on January 6th. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=467.4s)]
*  It will be wild. And we had all the other evidence. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=474.4s)]
*  What this shows is that everything we were saying was true and then some. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=478.4s)]
*  Of course, he was summoning these violent domestic extremist groups and should have known or would have known that they were violent. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=482.4s)]
*  When he stood up there, he knew the crowd that he was encouraging because he had received those warnings. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=488.4s)]
*  Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony was so great because it explained what preceded it and what followed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=493.4s)]
*  He knew they had guns but didn't care because they weren't seeking to shoot him. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=499.4s)]
*  And all these folks came prepared. And there's even more evidence of that because they were told the election was being stolen and they were summoned there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=503.4s)]
*  And I remember from the second impeachment, one of the most chilling pieces of film that I saw when preparing was the film when the people who raided it told the police, we're here because the president told us to come here and invited us. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=511.4s)]
*  And that's what they believe. And that's why he is singularly responsible. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=522.4s)]
*  So it is new evidence and it's powerful, further proof of his responsibility for everything that happened and that January 6th was the culmination of his attempt to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after all his other efforts had failed. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=526.4s)]
*  Now in terms of the relationship between these pro-Trump fascist paramilitary groups, members of which have been charged with seditious conspiracy and the culpability of the president, Congressman Raskin, who's going to co-lead tomorrow's hearing, I know you worked with him closely on Trump's second impeachment, he has said that tomorrow's hearing is not going to be about showing explicit evidence that Trump approved directly of these paramilitary groups. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=539.4s)]
*  Plans are that he told them to draw up plans like that. He said that isn't what they're setting out to prove. They're setting out to prove what he described as as a convergence of Trump's efforts and what the paramilitary groups are willing to do with weapons and with with violence. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=568.4s)]
*  Can you help us understand what that what that means? He's not talking about there being coincidentally pursuing the same idea. He's talking about there being converged efforts. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=585.4s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think I can't help but look at this as a trial lawyer because it's so effective to have Cassidy Hutchinson come in as the last witness say she heard Proud Boys oath keepers mentioned in connection with January 6. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=594.4s)]
*  They knew they were warned there was going to be violence. They knew and he was warned not to use the words to encourage the crowd to fight. And yet he sent out, you know, that January, December 19th tweet telling him to be there and be wild. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=608.4s)]
*  He knew what he was coming. So they're not going to say that he may have had direct conversations with the oath keepers or the Proud Boys, but it was all happening in real time. At the same time, he was trying to influence state officials telling him to find the exact amount of votes he needed to win. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=623.4s)]
*  Trying to get his senior DOJ officials just to say just say there's fraud and he'll take care of the rest. It was clear that these efforts were part of that broader scheme. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=639.4s)]
*  So I think what Jamie, who's the best was trying to say is they may not need to show and they won't show a direct communications, but they don't need to because the proof is overwhelming that these were all part of the same effort to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to interfere with the work of Congress. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=648.4s)]
*  And he shouldn't have been surprised that when you're reaching out telling the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by when you know these folks are hearing your messages that they will be armed and heavily armed. He just didn't care because they weren't there to harm him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=660.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was a unified holistic effort where everybody was aware of all of the other elements of the effort and one of the elements of the effort were heavily armed paramilitary trained fascist groups, you know, just another day at the office. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=670.4s)]
*  I think it's so important because it adds the violence to it that he knew and that's something that the American people can understand. The violent overthrow of government is something that we've never seen, let alone by a president United States. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=682.4s)]
*  So to see those efforts, I think really speaks volumes. And I think that's something that we need to be aware of. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=692.4s)]
*  Very Burke was lead counsel for Trump's second impeachment on these matters. Barry, thank you for helping us at the stage for that tomorrow. It's really great to have you here. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=698.4s)]
*  Couple of weeks ago here, just after the Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion in this country, we talked here on the show about one of the ways that abortion providers are trying to keep abortion services accessible to Americans. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=708.4s)]
*  We talked about mobile abortion clinics and abortion access group called Just the Pill announced that there would be they'd be launching a fleet of mobile clinics in the United States. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=721.4s)]
*  And we talked about the ability to access abortion services in the United States. And we talked about the ability to access abortion services in the United States. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=731.4s)]
*  We talked about mobile abortion clinics and abortion access group called Just the Pill announced that there would be they'd be launching a fleet of mobile clinics to park just over the border from states with abortion bans. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=741.4s)]
*  And from those mobile clinics, they'd have providers do consultations for medication abortions and dispensing pills, as well as providing surgical abortions for patients who need that or prefer that or who were too far along in their pregnancy for a medication abortion. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=755.4s)]
*  Just the Pill tells us tonight that they have now deployed their first medication abortion mobile clinic in a pilot program. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=769.4s)]
*  A second larger mobile clinic providing that and also surgical abortions will deploy later this summer. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=777.4s)]
*  Just the Pill's medical director tells ABC News that the vans are both completely unmarked and bulletproof. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=785.4s)]
*  These vehicles, these mobile clinics thus equipped take about eight months to build. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=793.4s)]
*  That's the main thing slowing their expansion to other states so far. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=797.4s)]
*  But that's what they're planning to do. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=800.4s)]
*  So that's one on the ground response to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=803.4s)]
*  Put abortion clinics on wheels and drive them to state borders to be as close to close as possible to women in these states where abortion is now banned. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=806.4s)]
*  But now there's another doctor who looked at a map and realized that for women in certain places like the deep south and south Texas, there is a place that is much closer than the nearest state where abortion could still be legal. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=814.4s)]
*  And that nearest place would be the sea, the ocean, the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=828.4s)]
*  Dr. Meg Autry is an OBGYN and professor at the University of California at San Francisco. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=835.4s)]
*  She plans to launch a floating abortion and reproductive health care clinic in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, a few miles off the coast and therefore a few miles out of reach of repressive state laws. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=840.4s)]
*  The idea is that for many women in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, it might be closer and easier and cheaper to get to a get to a boat to get to a floating clinic a few miles off the coast rather than trying to fly or drive to the nearest state where abortion is legal. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=852.4s)]
*  Now this project is still in the fundraising stage. For starters, Dr. Autry needs a boat to be able to make this happen. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=869.4s)]
*  But as sort of high in the sky and crazy as this idea might sound at first blush, there is really salient and extensive experience of doing this sort of thing for women who are seeking abortions. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=875.4s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago we spoke here on this show with Dr. Rebecca Gompertz, a Dutch doctor who has spent decades figuring out innovative ways to get abortion services to women in countries where abortion is illegal. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=888.4s)]
*  Her organization, Women on Waves, has spent years providing abortions on ships floating in international waters. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=898.4s)]
*  And the work that Dr. Gompertz has been doing globally, figuring out how to get women abortion services where their countries have made it illegal, well that is now work that needs to be done here inside the United States. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=905.4s)]
*  Figuring out how to get abortion services to women in states where it is illegal. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=917.4s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Meg Autry. She's a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Autry, I really appreciate you making time to be with us tonight. Thank you. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=923.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=932.4s)]
*  Am I explaining this, the basics of it, correctly and is there any important nuance here that I'm missing in terms of conveying this to our audience? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=935.4s)]
*  No, I think you pretty much got it. It is, I think one of the really important things to remember is that wealthy individuals in our country will be able to get the care that they want and how they want it whenever and wherever they want it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=943.4s)]
*  And this is serving a portion of our population that in these restricted states that are potentially unable to access those resources. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=958.4s)]
*  How daunting are the logistics of what you are proposing, what you're trying to do? I mean obviously there's the matter of acquiring a boat and getting it properly equipped and staffed and all that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=969.4s)]
*  But it just, it seems to me as somebody totally ignorant as to how something like this would work that there's also the very serious challenge of how you get women out to the facility that you're going to have to have several miles offshore, how you handle follow-up care and things like that to the extent that that's needed. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=980.4s)]
*  Can you talk to us a little bit about what is most daunting and what feels most doable about those logistics? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=998.4s)]
*  So the most daunting part is all aspects of this are incredibly daunting. And so although we're just going public, we've done an extensive amount of research and detail looking at this option and what seems to be the best way to go about it, both logistically from a security standpoint, from a legal standpoint. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1006.4s)]
*  What is most doable is we have, we know that the majority of our country doesn't believe in what is happening and that we must have bodily autonomy. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1027.4s)]
*  And because of that, we have an amazing amount of incredible people that you've already talked to about in your show that are determined to improve or create access for individuals who don't have it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1041.4s)]
*  Is this plan, is this project based at all off the kinds of similar work that has happened internationally? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1054.4s)]
*  We had Dr. Rebecca Gompertz here on the show talking about her international experience doing this for women in other countries where abortion has been illegal. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1062.4s)]
*  Have you, is this consciously based on that? Are you informed at all by her experience doing this in other countries? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1069.4s)]
*  So I came up with the idea completely separately, but was quickly alerted to Dr. Gompertz efforts and have spoken to her. So it's a little bit different. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1076.4s)]
*  She, as you know, had women on waves, which was on international waters off the coast of Ireland. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1086.4s)]
*  And my understanding focused mostly on medical abortions. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1093.4s)]
*  And so this is federal waters in the U.S. and different legal and different security issues, but very similar. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1097.4s)]
*  And she was, she's a visionary, a pioneer, and she was incredibly helpful in giving me advice going forward. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1106.4s)]
*  Dr. Meg Autry, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1114.4s)]
*  This is obviously an intriguing, extreme and also extremely necessary idea. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1119.4s)]
*  I think it's caught a lot of people's imagination because it is such, it's so mind blowing that this is the sort of thing that might be needed. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1126.4s)]
*  But you're working to do it practically. We'd be interested in hearing from you as you start putting together both the funds and the logistics to make it happen. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1133.4s)]
*  Please come back. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1139.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1140.4s)]
*  All right. Thanks for your time tonight. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1142.4s)]
*  For the past six and a half months, the most powerful telescope in the history of the world has been on its one million mile mission to look at the very first galaxies and stars ever formed. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1143.4s)]
*  Tonight, we finally got to see the first full color, full resolution images, our first image from that telescope. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1154.4s)]
*  It's the deepest look into the universe ever from the most powerful telescope ever made. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1161.4s)]
*  Some of the biggest, brightest lights in this image took four point six billion years to get to the telescope. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1167.4s)]
*  So looking at those lights on this image is like looking that far back in time. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1174.4s)]
*  NASA says actually some of the faintest lights in this image are almost as old as the universe itself. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1179.4s)]
*  They're over 13 billion years old. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1183.4s)]
*  Tomorrow at 1030 a.m. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1187.4s)]
*  Eastern, NASA is going to unveil more photos from the Webb Telescope. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1189.4s)]
*  That's the first one. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1192.4s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1193.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1196.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08SlZR97ZY&t=1219.4s)]
