# Putin Lashing Out At NATO Backfires As Interest In Membership Grows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ)
*  One of the easy and I think basically false cliches about the media, about the news media, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=0.0s)]
*  is that the news used to be way better. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=6.16s)]
*  That the news used to not be controversial. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=9.28s)]
*  That the news used to be always spoken in a calm, authoritative voice, with no snark [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  and no attitude, and everybody agreed it was just the facts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=18.54s)]
*  That's as far as it went. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  You hear that kind of facile cliché about what the news used to be like. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=24.88s)]
*  You hear it all the time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=28.64s)]
*  You hear even very smart people assert that that was true about the media in the good [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=29.64s)]
*  old days and couldn't we just go back to that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=33.84s)]
*  The problem with that is if you actually go back and listen to what the news was like [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=37.6s)]
*  in the good old days, it blows that thesis out of the water almost instantly. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=42.16s)]
*  Take for example the dripping sarcasm in this newsreel from the aforementioned good old [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=47.84s)]
*  days. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=53.96s)]
*  Peaceful Finland, that distant northern country of lakes and fjords, of sailing ships and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  summer bathing beaches, has been invaded and bombed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=61.52s)]
*  The long crisis of apparently futile negotiation with Moscow has ended in attack by overwhelming [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=65.84s)]
*  power. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=71.4s)]
*  The reason for this? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=72.4s)]
*  The Soviet, a nation of some 180 millions, has been threatened by the 4 millions in Finland. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=73.4s)]
*  The huge Russian air force, probably the biggest in the world, fears for its very existence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=78.92s)]
*  And the Red Fleet no doubt has been gravely menaced by Finland's two or three warships. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=84.96s)]
*  What are the real facts? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Ah, the good old days of voice of God authoritative news with no snark, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  That was a 1939 British newsreel just dripping with sarcasm as to why on earth the Soviet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=99.96s)]
*  Union felt like it could convince anybody that the reason it needed to invade the neighboring [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  nation of Finland was that Finland was some sort of threat to it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=112.36s)]
*  When Finland obviously was no threat. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=115.68s)]
*  I mean, Soviet Union, just like Putin is claiming about Ukraine now, the Soviet Union did claim [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=119.12s)]
*  that they were somehow in mortal danger from the much, much, much smaller country on their [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=124.96s)]
*  border. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=130.0s)]
*  This country with a much, much, much smaller military, a country that was doing nothing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=131.0s)]
*  at all to menace its much larger neighbor to the east. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=134.2s)]
*  Just like what Putin is saying about Ukraine, the Soviet Union said the same thing about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=138.8s)]
*  Finland in 1939. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=142.12s)]
*  But the Soviet Army did invade Finland in late 1939. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=143.84s)]
*  And it appears that their plan was to topple the government in Finland, probably in a matter [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=149.44s)]
*  of a few days. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=154.12s)]
*  They thought it would not be hard. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=155.44s)]
*  The Soviet military went in by land, by sea and by air. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=157.52s)]
*  They used about 100,000 troops, which is huge. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=161.16s)]
*  Their military just dwarfed the military force that the Finns had to defend themselves. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=164.68s)]
*  And their plan was that the Soviet Union would basically just take Finland and install their [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=170.0s)]
*  own puppet pro-Soviet government or maybe just even annex Finland, make Finland part [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  of the USSR, erase it as a sovereign country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  And again, they didn't think it would be hard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=183.6s)]
*  They thought it would take maybe a few days. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  It did not work that way. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=187.72s)]
*  The Finns in 1939 fought them off furiously. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=189.92s)]
*  I mean, there are, at the time, there were four million, less than four million people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=193.64s)]
*  in Finland, 180 million people in the Soviet Union and proportionate militaries to those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=197.84s)]
*  populations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  The Finns were outnumbered. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=205.24s)]
*  They were wildly outgunned. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=206.96s)]
*  But they were also resourceful. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=209.44s)]
*  They were fighting on their own home turf and they were more motivated than you can [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=211.2s)]
*  possibly imagine. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=214.28s)]
*  They were defending their homes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  That was called the Winter War. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  It started when the Soviets invaded in late 1939. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=222.2s)]
*  I'm sure Stalin thought his forces would be home for the new year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=225.32s)]
*  Instead, it stretched on into 1940. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  The Finns wore this remarkable white winter camouflage. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  They fought on skis and snowshoes and they just cut down the invading Soviet forces. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=237.92s)]
*  Finland, in fact, didn't have its own air force at all, but they still managed to shoot [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  down dozens of Soviet airplanes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=251.24s)]
*  In one famous battle in central Finland, it was 6,000 Finnish troops versus more than [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=254.64s)]
*  20,000 Soviet troops. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=259.4s)]
*  And the Finns just routed them, despite being outnumbered to such a massive extent. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=261.92s)]
*  The Soviets suffered huge casualties, hundreds of thousands of casualties, ultimately, in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=267.4s)]
*  their Finland invasion. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=273.96s)]
*  And the Western world was shocked. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=276.24s)]
*  The Western world had thought that the Soviets would have won in just a few days, too. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=277.92s)]
*  The Soviets thought that, but everybody else looking in thought that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=281.44s)]
*  When the Finns put up this unexpected and incredibly effective resistance, they became [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=285.04s)]
*  a cause celeb all over the United States. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  Even though our government didn't send them nearly as much practical help as they wanted, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  we still cheered them on. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=296.8s)]
*  Well, in the end, although it didn't go the way he expected it to at the beginning, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  Stalin regrouped. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=305.6s)]
*  He sent in not another 100,000 Soviet troops, but more like half a million Soviet troops [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  to get the job done. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  The population of Finland was less than four million people in the whole country. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=314.56s)]
*  Stalin had to send in a half million troops to finish the invasion in the end. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=318.48s)]
*  But the Finns still fought. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=324.44s)]
*  They held their ground for weeks, even after the half million Soviet troops arrived in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=325.98s)]
*  that second wave of the invasion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=330.48s)]
*  The Finns were able to hold on, ultimately, for more than 100 days. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=332.52s)]
*  And in the end, it did end. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=338.68s)]
*  The Finnish government was not toppled. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=340.52s)]
*  They negotiated a peace with the Soviets. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=342.88s)]
*  And the negotiated settlement was bad for Finland, but it was nowhere near as bad as [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=345.4s)]
*  what Stalin had intended for when he invaded in the first place and just thought he'd [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  run a rough shot over the place. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=353.47999999999996s)]
*  In the negotiated settlement that ended the Winter War, Finland did have to cede about [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=355.7s)]
*  10 percent of its territory to the Soviets, which is bad. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  But they stayed Finland. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  They kept their independence as a nation. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=368.92s)]
*  They kept their sovereignty. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=370.8s)]
*  They kept their way of government. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=371.8s)]
*  They even got to keep their army. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  They got to stay who they are. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=375.92s)]
*  And they also never forgot it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=379.1s)]
*  And because Russia invaded Ukraine, support has spiked in Finland and also in neighboring [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  for those two countries to now join NATO. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=388.2s)]
*  They never wanted to before, but now they do. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=391.44s)]
*  One of the million different contradictory justifications Putin's given for why he [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=395.4s)]
*  needed to invade Ukraine, one that you often hear parroted by people in this country apologizing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  for Putin, is this idea that Putin felt cramped by NATO, that too many countries to the west [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=404.18s)]
*  of Russia had joined NATO. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  They were too close to Russian borders. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=413.8s)]
*  So he had to invade Ukraine to ensure that Ukraine would never join NATO. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=415.96s)]
*  He's made this case that the reason for the war, at least one reason for this invasion, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  is that Putin couldn't stand the feeling of having any NATO countries right up against [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  Russia's borders. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=429.0s)]
*  Well, congratulations, Mr. Putin. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=430.96s)]
*  Guess what you got for invading Ukraine? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=433.52s)]
*  Even if Finland alone joins NATO, you will have just more than doubled the amount of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=435.64s)]
*  Russian land border with NATO countries. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=440.84s)]
*  Well done. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=444.68s)]
*  Sweden's ruling party, the Social Democrats, they've always been against Sweden joining [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=447.6s)]
*  NATO, as has the Swedish public. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=451.8s)]
*  But now both the Swedish public and that ruling party in Sweden have changed their minds. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=456.04s)]
*  In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party put out a statement yesterday that said, quote, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=460.92s)]
*  when Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden's security position changed fundamentally. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=464.16s)]

*  soon as this summer. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=480.32s)]
*  Even sooner than that, it looks like Finland is going to make its request to join. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=481.88s)]
*  And NATO will say yes when these countries ask. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=486.28s)]
*  One recent poll in Finland shows that even though just a couple of years ago, a majority [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=489.76s)]
*  of the Finnish public didn't want their country to join NATO, since Putin invaded [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=494.32s)]
*  Ukraine, they're sure in favor of it now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=499.56s)]
*  The Finnish people are now 68 percent in favor of joining, and that number spikes to 77 percent [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=501.71999999999997s)]

*  it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=511.76s)]
*  Well, next week, the Finnish government is going to present a security review on this [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=512.76s)]
*  issue to their parliament. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  A recent survey of members of the Finnish parliament says that of the 200 MPs, they've [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=517.1999999999999s)]

*  That's 194 in favor, six against. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=529.6s)]
*  Which means the Finnish government is going to recommend that they join NATO, and the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=535.12s)]
*  Finnish public is going to support them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=541.16s)]
*  And it's going to pass. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=543.28s)]
*  And it's going to pass soon, apparently. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  A former prime minister of Finland tells the AFP this week that it is a foregone conclusion [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=546.4s)]
*  that Finland will request NATO membership and the request will happen within the next [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=552.16s)]
*  few weeks. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=556.76s)]
*  It'll happen in time for the next NATO summit in June. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=557.76s)]
*  Now, Russia has responded by threatening that there's going to be consequences if that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=561.68s)]
*  happens, consequences including military consequences if two new nations join NATO. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=566.24s)]
*  But these aren't just any two countries. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=573.12s)]

*  Since the Winter War in 1940, Finland has been getting ready for those kinds of threats [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=576.8s)]

*  And at least now is implicitly threatening that they might do it again. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=586.88s)]
*  Finland is actually remarkably ready for those threats. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK1l56l9UQ&t=591.4399999999999s)]
