# Maddow: 'This is not a normal election between two normal candidates'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE)
*  One of the things that strongman leaders do when they do get control of a country is they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=0.0s)]
*  shut down independent media. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=6.12s)]
*  They make it a crime or they make it otherwise impossible for anybody to report or say or [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=7.76s)]
*  broadcast anything that is independent of the strongman or that is critical of the strongman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=12.76s)]
*  And that, of course, is not how the American system of government works. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=19.2s)]
*  With our robust First Amendment and freedom of the press protections, that's not at all [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=21.88s)]
*  how we are set up as a government and as a country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  But again, what's on the table from Republicans in this election is scrapping our system of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=31.24s)]
*  government and instead doing it the strongman way instead. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=36.72s)]
*  You say CBS should lose its license. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=40.92s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=44.96s)]
*  Well, I've never seen anything like it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=45.96s)]
*  The head of the FCC says we would never yank a license because the politician didn't like [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=47.56s)]
*  his or her coverage. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=53.72s)]
*  Well, this isn't a politician. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=54.72s)]
*  This is nothing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=56.2s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=57.36s)]
*  Now, what we're doing is we're going to subpoena their records. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=58.36s)]
*  Sixty minutes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  No, I think 60 minutes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  I think it should be taken off the air, frankly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=64.8s)]
*  This comes in the wake of that same candidate, Donald Trump, saying that ABC News should [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=67.84s)]
*  also have its broadcast license revoked. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=73.4s)]
*  And it comes in the wake of that same candidate saying that this network, MSNBC and NBC News, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=77.04s)]
*  should have its broadcast license revoked. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=82.0s)]
*  And it comes in the heels of him saying that the head of Facebook should be put in prison. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=84.92s)]
*  And it comes on the heels of him saying, just you wait, just you wait to see what he's going [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=89.86s)]
*  to do to the New York Times. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=93.86s)]
*  Wait until you see what I'm going to do to them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=95.78s)]
*  This is not normal American stuff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=99.98s)]
*  This isn't American at all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=103.08s)]
*  This is strongman authoritarian form of government stuff, which our Constitution protects us [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=105.44s)]
*  from explicitly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=110.6s)]
*  I mean, what Trump is proposing to do here in America to the media is what Putin, of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=112.28s)]
*  course, has already done in Russia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=117.08s)]
*  In Russia, it is state-controlled media only. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's the case everywhere. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  You've got an authoritarian in charge. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=125.56s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, the state-controlled media there includes Al-Arabiya TV. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=127.84s)]
*  You get a handy reminder of the fact that it's state-controlled media if you watch any [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=133.04s)]
*  of their clips online. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump loves Saudi Arabia, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  One of the many under-reported things in the presidential campaign this year, I think, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  was that in the midst of our presidential campaign just this summer, Trump signed a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=146.04s)]
*  deal to build Trump Tower Saudi Arabia in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=150.62s)]
*  That is a huge real estate deal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=156.4s)]
*  That is the Saudi government doling out a huge financial favor to Trump while he is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=159.66s)]
*  in the middle of his presidential campaign. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=165.9s)]
*  They are expecting, presumably, that if he does get back into the White House, that huge [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=167.96s)]
*  personal financial favor they just did him will still be fresh in his mind when it comes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=172.04000000000002s)]
*  to making American policy, American government policy, towards Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=176.32s)]
*  The Saudi royal family, you will recall, also stuffed $2 billion, billion with a B, $2 billion [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=182.88s)]
*  into the pockets of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner as soon as he left the White House. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=190.16s)]
*  The New York Times recently reporting that the Saudis have seen precisely zero return [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=195.48s)]
*  on that supposed investment in Jared Kushner. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=200.62s)]
*  He's just kept all the money and skimmed out over $100 million in fees for himself while [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=203.28s)]
*  returning nothing to them, at least so far. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=209.54s)]
*  But presumably that's because they're not expecting to be paid back by him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=214.6s)]
*  They're expecting to be paid back by the White House, by the American people. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=218.24s)]
*  The Saudis don't seem to be all that eager to get any of that money back from old Jared [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=224.28s)]
*  because they know they'll get it back another way. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  From us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=233.54s)]
*  From policy at our expense to pay back the people who have paid him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=235.12s)]
*  So the Trump relationship with Saudi Arabia is very well-oiled. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=239.0s)]
*  Honestly, if you wanted to create like a kindergarten-level textbook, one of those books where the pages [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=243.08s)]
*  are cards, card stock. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=249.14s)]
*  You wanted to create a kindergarten-level textbook to explain to a kindergartner what [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=252.16s)]
*  corruption is. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=255.84s)]
*  This is how you might spell it out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=257.24s)]
*  Now, imagine your friend is running for president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=259.28s)]
*  Somebody gives your friend a huge, sweet business deal while he's running for president. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=262.36s)]
*  And that same someone then gives your friend's family billions of dollars while he's running [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=266.64s)]
*  for president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=270.96s)]
*  C is for corruption. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=271.96s)]
*  Your friend is corrupt. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=274.68s)]
*  And then if it was like a good children's book, it would say, oh, but don't worry, this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=278.04s)]
*  could never happen in the United States of America. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=281.64s)]
*  Now, we'd have to update that textbook. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  But anyway, today, Al-Arabiya, Saudi state-controlled media, posted a new interview with Donald [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=288.76s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=297.44s)]
*  And this new interview with Donald Trump, it was just published today, it got basically [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=298.8s)]
*  zero pickup in the United States, which is kind of amazing, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=302.32s)]
*  interview gets zero pickup two weeks before Election Day. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=306.48s)]
*  But I think the reason this interview didn't get any pickup might be because of the headline [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  that Saudi state-controlled Al-Arabiya slapped on the video when they posted it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=318.32s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=324.26s)]
*  They put on this, quote, Trump says Middle East peace possible if elected. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=325.26s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's what we're all expecting, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  Elect Donald Trump. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=333.8s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=334.8s)]
*  Well, for starters, you'll get peace in the Middle East. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=335.8s)]
*  It's evaded the geniuses of many generations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=340.56s)]
*  But that six-dimensional chess player, I'll be able to sort it out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=344.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=350.2s)]
*  Peace and Trump will bring about peace in the Middle East if he's elected. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  You will be surprised to learn that that was not the actual newsworthy takeaway from that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=356.12s)]
*  interview with Saudi state-controlled media. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=360.68s)]
*  What is the actual newsworthy takeaway from that interview? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=363.2s)]
*  Is that in that interview, Trump just flat out said that there aren't hostages being [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  held by Hamas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=372.0s)]
*  He says they're all dead. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=373.68s)]
*  Imagine if you're the family member of one of these hostages who's been held for a year [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=376.84s)]
*  now by Hamas. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=381.08s)]
*  And a presidential candidate in the United States comes out and says, yeah, well, they're [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=383.0s)]
*  pretty much all dead. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=387.0s)]
*  Most of them are dead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=388.0s)]
*  Oh, well. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=389.0s)]
*  That is what he said today. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=391.2s)]
*  That is what he said. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=392.34s)]
*  Now, still, you have hostages, but many of them have been killed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=393.34s)]
*  And I'm sure many of them are dead. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  I think even early on, I think a lot of those hostages were dead. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=400.46s)]
*  I think they were dead. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=405.02s)]
*  Imagine the cruelty of that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=406.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=408.14s)]
*  If you're the family of a hostage in Gaza, you've been working for a year now desperately [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=409.14s)]
*  to get your loved one out of there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=415.34s)]
*  Imagine you're the family of an American hostage held in Gaza, and you are counting, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=417.82s)]
*  among other things, on the American government to do all it can to get your brother or your [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=423.82s)]
*  mother or your daughter out alive as a hostage. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  And here's a man running to be president of the United States saying, yeah, I'm sure, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=434.14s)]
*  you know, I'm sure they're all dead. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=437.74s)]
*  I'm sure they're all dead. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=441.86s)]
*  Trump also said in his Al-Arabiya Saudi state-controlled media interview today that he would have done [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=445.62s)]
*  a deal with Hamas, that if Hamas wanted to do something like October 7th, Trump would [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=451.42s)]
*  have stepped in and done a deal with them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=457.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=459.46s)]
*  So if you liked it when Trump invited the Taliban to come to Camp David, well, now here [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=460.46s)]
*  he is two weeks before the presidential election saying if he were president again, he'd make [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=464.82s)]
*  deals with Hamas. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=469.46s)]
*  That's how he would have solved the October 7th problem. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=471.7s)]
*  I would have made a deal with them and they wouldn't have done October 7th. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=475.66s)]
*  You know, Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign cratered because he put on a helmet that made [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDmMYGhHoNE&t=481.54s)]
