# Maddow: Trump, Acolytes Are Working To Turn Republicans Against Elections (And Succeeding)
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo)
*  Even as President Biden was calling the new president-elect, the newspapers in Brazil [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=0.0s)]
*  today carried a statement from Trump adviser Steve Bannon, saying there's no possibility [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=4.4s)]
*  that the election result is correct, that Bolsonaro should start a months-long ballot-by-ballot [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=9.68s)]
*  audit of the results, and that whatever he does, he definitely shouldn't leave office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=15.4s)]
*  He should stay in office despite the election results. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  In a livestream last night responding to the election results in Brazil, Steve Bannon said [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  it more bluntly. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=28.68s)]
*  He said Bolsonaro, quote, can't concede. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=29.68s)]
*  Can't concede. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=34.04s)]
*  Why not? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=37.88s)]
*  Why can't he concede? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=39.32s)]
*  And why do you care, Steve Bannon? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=40.32s)]
*  I mean, this is the part that's about us, that's about us and our country and our election [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=43.04s)]
*  next week. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=49.6s)]
*  Because why do you think it is that this top White House adviser to former President Donald [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump, why do you think it is that he's telling this guy in Brazil, this Trump-like, far-right, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=56.88s)]
*  buffoonish, unpopular Brazilian president who's just been voted out of office, why [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=63.6s)]
*  is Steve Bannon telling him that he shouldn't admit to the election results, he shouldn't [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=68.08s)]
*  admit that he's been voted out, he cannot concede? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think Bannon is doing that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=77.68s)]
*  Do you think that Steve Bannon has some substantive fact-based beliefs about the integrity of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Brazil's elections? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=84.72s)]
*  Do you think he has some facts that he knows that have made him concerned about how votes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=85.76s)]
*  are counted in São Paulo? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=90.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=91.68s)]
*  Do you think he has important information about something being wrong with a voting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=92.68s)]
*  machine in Santa Catarina or some other place in Brazil he's never been to that I'm probably [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=95.92s)]
*  mispronouncing? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean, why do you think Steve Bannon cares? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  Why did Trump endorse Bolsonaro and endorse his voter fraud claims even in advance of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=106.64s)]
*  the election? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  Why is it that we can be absolutely, 100% sure that if Trump were still president instead [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=112.96s)]
*  of Joe Biden, the U.S. government itself would be refusing to acknowledge that Bolsonaro [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=117.8s)]
*  just lost this election? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=122.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=124.44s)]
*  Why do they do this? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=125.44s)]
*  It is not about Brazil. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=128.32s)]
*  It is about us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=130.2s)]
*  It is about propagating and inculcating into us, or at least inculcating into their supporters, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=132.34s)]
*  this belief, this conviction that elections are bad, that elections are suspect, that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=141.06s)]
*  elections are for suckers. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=148.54s)]
*  And anybody who's not a sucker shouldn't believe any election result anywhere. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=150.48s)]
*  Elections suck. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=155.48s)]
*  They're a hoax. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=157.9s)]
*  They're a racket. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=158.9s)]
*  We shouldn't use them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=159.9s)]
*  We know better. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=160.9s)]
*  And this line of attack, it isn't about any one election. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  It's not about any particular allegation of something being wrong with some particular [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=166.3s)]
*  election. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=170.34s)]
*  It's about elections as elections. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=171.34s)]
*  It's about elections as a category. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=173.62s)]
*  And you can see it at work in all these different instances, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=176.86s)]
*  That's how you can see it sort of. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=180.66s)]
*  There's no exceptions here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  It's a rule. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  You can see it at work with Trump and his remoras, like Steve Bannon insisting that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  Trumpy guys all around the world shouldn't have to abide by election results. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=188.8s)]
*  You can see it at home coming into sharper focus now, now that we're eight days out [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=193.0s)]
*  from the next national election. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=197.86s)]
*  Trump issuing a new endorsement of the Republican candidate who's running against Senator Maggie [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=200.06s)]
*  Hassan in New Hampshire in this election. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=204.44s)]
*  Trump endorses him now by saying outright that what he likes about the guy is that he [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=207.2s)]
*  is quote, a strong and proud election denier. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=211.04s)]
*  So they're embracing that term now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=217.12s)]
*  You must be a strong and proud election denier. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=220.14s)]
*  Those are Trump's words in order to get his endorsement as the de facto leader of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=222.98s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  You also see it in that odd footage that's being aired by Fox News over the past few [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  days of Trump calling the Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, this guy, Blake Masters, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=234.44s)]
*  the one who's running against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=239.72s)]
*  Trump tells him on the call that, hey, Blake Masters, you're doing great, but you need [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  to go harder and louder and more insistent on the issue of election denial. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=246.48s)]
*  You need to be more out there volunteering all the time saying that elections shouldn't [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=251.0s)]
*  count. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  And Blake Masters says, oh, yes, I'll do that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=256.58s)]
*  I'll go hard on that issue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  Why does Trump need that? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=260.14s)]
*  Why does Trump need that from this Senate candidate in Arizona or the Senate candidate [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=261.82s)]
*  in Nevada? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=266.14s)]
*  They're not going to be voting on anything related to the 2020 election where Trump lost. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=267.14s)]
*  Why does Trump want to do this? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=271.86s)]
*  Why does he want all Republican candidates at every level to insist that elections are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=274.64s)]
*  for suckers and that election results don't count? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=281.28s)]
*  The reason he wants to do this is so this idea that elections shouldn't be the way [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=287.52s)]
*  we do things anymore becomes the rallying cry in the operating principle of the Republican [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=291.82s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's working within the Republican Party. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, ever since Trump won the Republican nomination for president in 2016, thanks to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=301.18s)]
*  a Republican primary system, he said was rigged and fraudulent. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=305.96s)]
*  And then he won the general election that year and still said there was fraud in that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=309.8s)]
*  election. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=313.64s)]
*  There were millions of illegal votes cast in that election. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=314.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=316.76s)]
*  I mean, even in elections that he wins, he says there was fraud, right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=317.76s)]
*  Right through to the 2020 campaign, or even before the election, he claimed that election [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=321.0s)]
*  was fraudulent and that it shouldn't count. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=325.1s)]
*  Why would you try to undermine faith in an election that you won? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=329.4s)]
*  Why would you try to undermine faith in elections in other countries that most Americans can't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  spell? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=338.26s)]
*  Why would you try to get everybody in your party to say that election results don't [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=339.26s)]
*  count, even when they're not in a position to reverse some sort of election result to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=343.82s)]
*  put you back in power? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=348.56s)]
*  It's so that the idea that elections don't count becomes the operating principle of the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=350.94s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  Say elections are messed up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=358.1s)]
*  Insist that you have proof of some kind that you can't show right now, but you have it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  Proof that the elections are messed up. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=365.76000000000005s)]
*  On the basis of your false claims that the elections are messed up, then set about actually [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  messing up elections to prove your point. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=372.36s)]
*  That's the phrase that we're in now, right? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=377.44s)]
*  There's 67 counties in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  In 50 of those 67 counties, the elections chiefs have left office since the last election [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=381.32000000000005s)]
*  because of threats and intimidation. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=387.26s)]
*  50 out of the 67 counties in the state. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=388.8s)]
*  How smoothly do you think elections are going to go in that state this year? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=393.36s)]
*  In Nevada, there's 17 counties. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  Election supervisors in 10 of the 17 counties in the state have left already or announced [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=399.04s)]
*  they are leaving, again, ahead of threats and intimidation from the political right. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=403.36s)]
*  You may have seen the news over the weekend about this Republican-controlled county in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=409.72s)]
*  that is breaking its election system so profoundly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  They are swearing in dozens of citizens to be citizen hand counters of their ballots, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  and that's the only way they want to count. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=423.38000000000005s)]
*  This is a system they are newly inventing that last week took 60 people one full day [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=425.26000000000005s)]
*  to count 900 votes poorly. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=431.0s)]
*  60 people counting. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  A full day's work, less than 1,000 votes counted. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=435.88000000000005s)]
*  Here's the Associated Press. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=440.42s)]
*  Two groups of five counters that the AP observed spent about three hours each counting 50 ballots. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=442.1s)]
*  Mismatched tallies led to recounts and occasionally to more recounts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=449.5s)]
*  Several of the counters noted how arduous the process was, with one volunteer lamenting, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  I can't believe it's two hours to get through 25 votes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=457.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=461.86s)]
*  If this is how you're going to count them, this is a county with 33,000 registered votes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=463.46000000000004s)]
*  Took 60 people a full day to get through less than 1,000 votes. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=468.9s)]
*  They've got 33,000 registered voters in that county. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  They're getting rid of the election system there, effectively. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=482.23999999999995s)]
*  They're having randos just personally rifle through the ballots and see what they might [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  come up with. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=488.67999999999995s)]
*  To get through 33,000 votes on actual election day, where there's a tight Senate race and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=489.84s)]
*  other stuff that's really important on the ballot, yeah, it might take them a few months, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=494.2s)]
*  I don't know, maybe a year to get some kind of tally. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=497.86s)]
*  Nobody will have much faith in it when they do. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  It's a system, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=502.74s)]
*  Say the elections are messed up. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  On the basis of that, actually do mess them up. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=507.78s)]
*  Then, when the elections are messed up, claim vindication. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=510.97999999999996s)]
*  And show everyone, hey, look, this election thing we used to do, it's just too broken [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=515.98s)]
*  to even try to use that anymore. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=519.3s)]
*  Wow, what a mess. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=520.86s)]
*  Why would anybody believe those results? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=521.86s)]
*  Let's throw the results out. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILnLEt1Thuo&t=524.78s)]
