# Activists set sights on House Republicans in Biden-won districts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k)
*  For 2023, there is an updated indivisible guide. And just like the first one, it is very, very, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=0.0s)]
*  very nuts and bolts. It is practical, actionable advice. Check this out. This was a joint protest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=6.88s)]
*  held by indivisible members and members of the Working Families Party who live in New York [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=15.68s)]
*  Republican Congressman Mike Lawler's district. You can see from their signs that what they're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=20.0s)]
*  protesting here are the very, very unpopular Republican proposals to cut Medicare and cut [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=25.04s)]
*  Social Security. And what Mike Lawler's constituents are doing here tracks with the advice from the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  new indivisible guide, page 13, what to do if you have a Republican member of Congress. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=36.4s)]
*  Step one, focus on their unpopular ideas and relentlessly tie them to their least appealing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=41.36s)]
*  positions or controversies. The guide goes on to say you should use every possible opportunity [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=46.64s)]
*  to get your member of Congress on the record on those issues. And true to form, just as the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=52.8s)]
*  indivisible guide predicted, in response to that protest, Congressman Lawler had to go on the record. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=60.0s)]
*  He had to release an on the record statement to a local news outlet saying that he opposes any cuts [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=66.24s)]
*  to Social Security and Medicare. There it is in black and white. They got him on the record. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=72.0s)]
*  Congressman Lawler now on the record opposing cuts to those programs. That is a form of progress [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=77.52s)]
*  in trying to save those programs. Indivisible has now in March launched a new campaign targeting 18 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=83.28s)]
*  Republican members of Congress, including Mike Lawler, who represent districts that President [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Biden won in the 2020 election. So they are Republican members, but their district voted for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=96.56s)]
*  The reason those 18 are being targeted by indivisible in this new campaign is because, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=102.72s)]
*  practical as ever, indivisible believes that that's the start of the road for Democrats to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=108.72s)]
*  take back the House in 2024. You start with picking off those 18 and you move on from there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Ezra Levin, who's co-founder of indivisible, who has joined us from time to time [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=120.88s)]
*  over the past few years to talk about the progress of this group and how this very practical approach [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=126.0s)]
*  to organizing is working in our divided and easily distracted society. Ezra, it is nice to see you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=131.2s)]
*  Thanks for being here. Great to see you, Rachel. Was that an appropriate way to describe the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=136.88s)]
*  trajectory that this is a there's a new indivisible guide for 2023. It's specific to the fact that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  Republicans are in control of the House and it's about sort of protecting progressive priorities, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=149.44s)]
*  but also trying to orient Democrats toward taking back control of the House as soon as possible. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=155.28s)]
*  Gosh, Rachel, you did such a good job. I'm going to struggle to add to it, but I'll try. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=162.4s)]
*  And that is this. We really have I'm not I'm not trying about it. We have a top level goal. I would [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=167.6s)]
*  like to see us retake the House, hold the Senate, hold the presidency, reform the filibuster, codify [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=172.16s)]
*  row, pass democracy reform. That's my North Star. That's the North Star of indivisibles [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=178.64s)]
*  all throughout the country. The theory is exactly as you laid out. We are not going to take every [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=183.44000000000003s)]
*  single one of the 435 House districts in 2024. That's not the pathway to victory. The pathway [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=188.56s)]
*  to victory is where is the low hanging fruit? And it turns out, just as you said, there are 18 [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=194.4s)]
*  Republican members of Congress who represent districts that Biden won in 2020. So what do you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  do in those districts? How do you take on these folks? Now, there's this guy, Michael Aller, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=206.08s)]
*  you just covered. I'm going to go out on a limb and say probably 99 percent of people have not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  heard of Representative Mike Lawler. They've heard of Marjorie Taylor Greene. They've heard of Matt [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=216.0s)]
*  Gates. They've heard of Lauren Borburt. Why haven't they heard of Mike Lawler? And it's because this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=220.4s)]
*  guy who represents a Biden won district knows that he's got one path to reelection that. And that is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=225.52s)]
*  you've got to raise a whole bunch of money from donors like he was. You got to vote more or less [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=234.24s)]
*  the way those donors want you to vote. He votes 94 percent of the time with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=239.92s)]
*  And three, this is the tricky part. This is the really tricky part. You've got to convince your [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=245.6s)]
*  constituents that you're not one of the bad guys in Congress. And so that means keeping your [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=250.32s)]
*  constituents in the dark, trying to not say that you vote 94 percent of the time with Marjorie [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=255.76s)]
*  Taylor Greene. And the good news is sunlight is the best disinfectant and constituents based in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=260.64s)]
*  that 17th congressional district were able to show up and say, hey, you got to represent us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=267.84s)]
*  Don't side with Marjorie Taylor Greene. And in this one instance, we were able to help [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=273.28s)]
*  limit the harm from this member of Congress. Now, we are going to try to do that in every single one [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=277.52s)]
*  of these 18 districts. Sometimes we're going to get them to go on the record. Sometimes they're [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=283.44s)]
*  going to vote against us. And so it's going to depend on constituents in those districts to hold [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=287.2s)]
*  them accountable and make sure there is a political price to pay for their extremism. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Ezra, over the past six years that you've been involved in this organizing effort, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=298.08s)]
*  which, again, started small and turned into this big thing, do you feel like there are big lessons [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=302.96s)]
*  learned in terms of what works, what's effective, what you might have thought from the outset would [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=308.0s)]
*  work that doesn't or things that you've steered more toward because they have had [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=312.64s)]
*  multiplicative effects? They've been more effective than you thought. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, one thing that we always say is pictures are didn't happen. You can call your [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=320.4s)]
*  unrepresentative one of these 18 and they are going to have a staffer take down your message [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=324.88s)]
*  and say, oh, we are really concerned with what you have to say. But if that doesn't go anywhere, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=330.0s)]
*  then there will be no accountability. So seeing what these constituents actually did in the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=335.36s)]
*  districts to get local attention, they got local press coverage of their event, they got him on [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=340.8s)]
*  the record. That's what moved him. So as much as possible, I do think it is important to lean [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=346.32s)]
*  into public pressure. That's what a member of Congress running in the district really cares [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=352.72s)]
*  about. It's one of the reasons why if you go to indivisible.org, you can check out the resources [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=357.6s)]
*  we've got. If you're in district, you can connect with other local groups who are doing this work [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  and do the work in real time. If you're out of district, we are working to connect folks out of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=366.88000000000005s)]
*  district to support real constituents in those districts. So I hope everybody knows that it [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=372.16s)]
*  doesn't mean you've got to be in the district to be supportive of this effort. We think everybody [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=377.36s)]
*  has a role to play. And that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to empower everybody to make [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=383.36s)]
*  sure Congress is truly representative. As relevant co-founder of indivisible, as always doing some [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=387.68s)]
*  of the most practical, strategically interesting organizing in the country. Thanks for being with [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=394.24s)]
*  us again, as it's nice to see you. Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=398.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWFbSDNh1k&t=407.36s)]
