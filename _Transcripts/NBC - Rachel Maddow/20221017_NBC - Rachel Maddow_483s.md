# Report Reveals Greater Extent Of Trump Admin Interference In CDC Than Previously Known
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0)
*  Two and a half years ago, in the spring of 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic was just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=0.0s)]
*  starting to rage, the White House installed a Trump campaign aid to take over the CDC. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=7.24s)]
*  Somebody with zero public health experience, somebody with zero science experience put [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  that person in there to basically ride herd at the CDC. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=19.82s)]
*  With that appointment, the CDC had to run everything through this Trump campaign aid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=23.56s)]
*  Everything they wanted to say to the American public about the pandemic first had to be [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=28.42s)]
*  approved by that random guy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=31.46s)]
*  And that included the CDC's gold standard scientific reports, which are called MMWRs, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=34.38s)]
*  morbidity and mortality weekly reports. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  MMWR is written by career scientists. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=42.82s)]
*  And during the pandemic, just as in every public health crisis before it in the modern [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=46.38s)]
*  era, MMWR has served to inform doctors and researchers and the public about the latest [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=51.1s)]
*  crisis. In this case, it was COVID-19, how it was spreading, who is at risk, the best [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=57.74s)]
*  proven ways to protect yourself. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  MMWR is the international gold standard for public health communications. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=64.38s)]
*  It is often described as the voice of the CDC. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=69.66s)]
*  As a rule, MMWR reports are never reviewed by political staff. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=72.34s)]
*  They are purely science. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=76.3s)]
*  But then this Trump appointee comes in and he starts berating CDC scientists because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=79.22s)]
*  their purely scientific information about COVID is making Donald Trump look bad. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=84.62s)]
*  While the congressional investigation into the government's COVID response has just today [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  released new emails they obtained from this period. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=93.68s)]
*  Here for example, is the top staffer to that Trump campaign guy responding to a new MMWR [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=97.26s)]
*  report about COVID risks to children. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=102.42s)]
*  He says, quote, who writes this garbage? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=105.34s)]
*  He says the CDC director, quote, gots to start firing people in large numbers there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=108.44s)]
*  This agency is working against the president daily. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=114.32s)]
*  Yeah, he gots to do that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=117.52s)]
*  There's dozens and dozens of emails like this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=119.88s)]
*  At one point, Trump's own chief of staff, White House chief of staff, personally calls [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  the deputy director of the CDC to dress her down and yell at her over a different MMWR [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=126.88s)]
*  he thought made Trump look particularly bad. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=132.24s)]
*  That deputy director at CDC said she'd never gotten a call from a White House chief of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=135.12s)]
*  33 year career at CDC before that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=139.4s)]
*  But again, these were scientists writing scientific reports about an ongoing worsening pandemic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=143.84s)]
*  The Trump administration said those scientific reports had to go, they had to be changed [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=150.36s)]
*  to make Trump not look so bad. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=154.62s)]
*  The science be damned. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  And today we learned the extent to which they succeeded in meddling with that science. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=159.52s)]
*  According to this new report from the investigation into the Trump administration's COVID response, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  Trump political appointees weighted into metal with at least 19 different scientific [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=168.76s)]
*  reports about the pandemic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Today's report concludes, quote, the degree of control and hostility that the Trump administration [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=177.0s)]
*  exerted over the historically independent agency not only demoralized CDC officials, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=181.12s)]
*  but also undermined Americans trust in public health. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=186.68s)]
*  As we now head into our third winter living with COVID and new variants continue to evolve [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=191.2s)]
*  and less than 10% of Americans have gotten the latest vaccine booster. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=196.4s)]
*  Reminded every day that that eroded trust in public health will take a long, long time [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=201.0s)]
*  to rebuild if we ever can. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  Quote, the previous administration engaged in an unprecedented campaign of political [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=207.84s)]
*  interference in the federal government's pandemic response, which undermined public [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=213.64s)]
*  health to benefit the former president's political goals. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=217.28s)]
*  That is the conclusion today from the chair of the congressional investigation into the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=221.9s)]
*  Trump administration's COVID response. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=225.44s)]
*  They've just released a new report detailing how bad political interference was with the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=227.24s)]
*  CDC and the lasting damage that it did. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=232.28s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  He is the chair of that investigation, which released this report today. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=238.68s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=242.32s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=244.0s)]
*  Well, thank you very much for having me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  While it was happening here on the show, we we tried to pretty closely cover what appeared [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=248.84s)]
*  to be political interference in the CDC's work. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=254.0s)]
*  Even still, reading your report today, it is way worse than I thought. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=256.88s)]
*  I wonder if you felt that way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=263.2s)]
*  Was there more damage done than you were expecting to find at the outset of this inquiry? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=264.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=270.4s)]
*  We had a two year investigation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=271.4s)]
*  We attempted to pull back the curtains so that the people can see exactly what was taking [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=274.8s)]
*  place. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=280.96s)]
*  We knew from the general reports that there was some kind of interference taking place. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  We had no idea the extent to which this administration was going in suppressing information, submitting [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=288.68s)]
*  misinformation, doing whatever they could to make this administration or that administration [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  look better than they should have looked. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=305.88s)]
*  It was just incredible what they were doing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=309.44s)]
*  Even deleting information, we had people to testify that they were ordered to delete certain [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=312.88s)]
*  things. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=319.52s)]
*  And in at least five instances, we saw where there was deletions and delays. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=320.52s)]
*  It was absolutely incredible. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=328.28s)]
*  I was struck in looking at the report how many times when you interviewed CDC officials [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=331.72s)]
*  and CDC scientists, they would all say some version of, you know, I've worked at CDC [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=336.8s)]
*  for X years, for X decades. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=341.56s)]
*  Nothing like this had ever happened before. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=343.64s)]
*  I'd never been confronted with this kind of interference before. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=345.32s)]
*  The fact that this was so unprecedented, that the CDC was previously so walled off from [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=348.48s)]
*  political interference, I wondered if you came to think that that might have been something [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=352.86s)]
*  that actually made them more vulnerable to this kind of meddling, because basically they [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=357.64s)]
*  didn't have antibodies against it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=361.92s)]
*  They didn't have defenses because they'd never had to confront this kind of this kind [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=363.36s)]
*  of corruption before. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's a fair conclusion to draw. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=369.6s)]
*  These are scientists. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=373.36s)]
*  These are people who believe that their purpose is to protect the American people. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=375.0s)]
*  We had the worst medical problem in this country in 100 years, and they were dedicated to learning [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  from past experiences and doing the things that are necessary to protect the public. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=390.28s)]
*  They were not prepared to have to deal with political interference. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  In fact, that's not their long suit. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=399.67999999999995s)]
*  Their job is to simply do the research, do the science, inform the public, and then hopefully [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=402.23999999999995s)]
*  the leadership would be there by the politicians to do as necessary to protect the public. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=411.28s)]
*  They had their information supplanted and deleted, and in many instances they were insulted [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=419.2s)]
*  and embarrassed. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  The importance of this kind of inquiry, the importance of this kind of report, is to get [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=431.2s)]
*  the history right about what happened. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=434.5s)]
*  But the next step, of course, is making sure, using that history to make sure this doesn't [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  happen again and that the CDC does have defense. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=441.02s)]
*  They do have people to go to. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=444.16s)]
*  They do have a way to defend themselves if anybody ever tries to do this to them again. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=445.48s)]
*  You've given us as a country the ammunition to do that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  Congressman James Clyburn, chair of the committee investigating the government's COVID response, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=454.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you for being with us tonight and thank you for this important work. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka7wWsG2PW0&t=461.8s)]
