# 84-year-old charged in shooting of Black teen who went to wrong house
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs)
*  On Thursday this past week, a 16-year-old boy was sent out by his mom to go pick up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=0.0s)]
*  his two younger brothers. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  His two younger brothers had been at a friend's house, but this young man, 16-year-old young [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=7.76s)]
*  man, his name is Ralph, he got confused by the address. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=14.64s)]
*  He accidentally rang the doorbell at the wrong house on a nearby street. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=20.72s)]
*  One street over, he was going to what he thought was the house where his younger twin brothers [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=26.44s)]
*  were staying with a friend. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=32.28s)]
*  He went by accident to the wrong house on a neighboring street. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=33.28s)]
*  An 85-year-old white man who lived at that house answered the door, and according to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=37.64s)]
*  court documents, when the man saw 16-year-old Ralph Yarle on his doorstep, he shot him [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=41.04s)]
*  twice. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=47.16s)]
*  Shot him once in the head, then opened his door and shot him once in the arm. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=48.16s)]
*  According to prosecutors, Ralph Yarle never entered the man's home. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=51.32s)]
*  He was shot through the glass of the front door for the first shot. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=54.82s)]
*  Miraculously, Ralph Yarle survived. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=59.74s)]
*  He got up and he ran away. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=62.86s)]
*  He reportedly had to go to three different homes before someone agreed to help him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Yarle has been in the hospital since Thursday night, but he was discharged this afternoon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=68.78s)]
*  He's now at his home recovering. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  His mom is a nurse, and she's been caring for him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=74.94s)]
*  Tonight, Monday night, four days after the shooting took place, the county prosecutor [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=77.42s)]
*  announced that the man who shot Ralph Yarle will be charged in the shooting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=81.78s)]
*  He'll be charged with two felony counts, including first degree assault. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  When the prosecutor announced the charges, he said there was, quote, a racial component [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  to the case. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=95.14000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Quentin Lucas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=96.5s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=100.34s)]
*  I know this is a difficult time for your city. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=106.78s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if I explained that in a way which is in keeping with your [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=108.22s)]
*  understanding of these events, if I got anything wrong, or if there's anything important that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=112.7s)]
*  I left out here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  You know, I've read the probable cause charging statement, and probably just the most heinous [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=120.94s)]
*  part is that the gentleman who shot, I shouldn't say gentleman, just the criminal, the defendant, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=125.38s)]
*  an 85-year-old man shot because he claimed he was scared of this black teenager. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=132.02s)]
*  And I say a black teenage boy, not because of an insult, more because of the fact that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=138.5s)]
*  this is a kid. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=143.94s)]
*  This is a kid who's sent out by his mother to pick up his younger brothers, the sort [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=145.38s)]
*  of thing that should be normal and routine and indeed is. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=149.74s)]
*  And in our community, tragically, last week, it was something that could have taken this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=153.66000000000003s)]
*  boy's life. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=157.34s)]
*  This young man is accomplished. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=159.1s)]
*  He's a musician, superintendent of North Kansas City Schools today, said he's an excellent [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=162.62s)]
*  student, maintains a stellar GPA while taking college-level courses. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=167.3s)]
*  Lots of people going on about his talent as a musician, his affiliation with the Metropolitan [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  Youth Orchestra and the marching band. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about his condition and how he and his family are doing? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=181.54s)]
*  I talked to his mother today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=188.5s)]
*  She is a strong woman. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=190.3s)]
*  I could tell during our time just visiting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=192.54s)]
*  The last several days, I know, have been overwhelming for them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=195.1s)]
*  So many people who have reached out, so many people in support, but also a number of questions, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=198.46s)]
*  questions about why. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=203.82s)]
*  Why delay in charges? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  I know that's a question that's come up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=206.34s)]
*  Why and how can something like this happen? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  And the neighborhood in Kansas City, which is predominantly white, this question that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  I know many black parents face, and black people generally. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=214.86s)]
*  They move there because of good schools, because of good opportunities. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=218.6s)]
*  But what do you lose in exchange? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=221.84s)]
*  Does your child, do you lose your humanity in exchange just from existing while black [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=224.36s)]
*  in certain areas? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  What we need to work on in Kansas City, and I would say nationwide after this, is how [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=231.36s)]
*  do we make sure that we get, first of all, that it's clear that this is not right, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=235.24s)]
*  that this is not something that's accepted, and this fear, this fear of black youth, of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  black people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  You talked about it through the entire show. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=245.48000000000002s)]
*  It's something that we need to confront, that we need to call out, that we need to address. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=247.96s)]
*  And we need to not have the narrative just be state legislatures that are against diversity [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=251.16s)]
*  training, including in my own state. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=255.48s)]
*  But instead, frankly, people recognizing the bias that lives within so many of them, so [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=257.8s)]
*  we don't see things like this happening again and again. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=262.48s)]
*  One of the things that I've seen discussed in the wake of this shooting is the so-called [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=266.08s)]
*  Stand Your Ground law, which Missouri's had for a number of years now, since I believe [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=270.38s)]
*  it was 2016. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=276.64s)]
*  Is there any sense in which that Stand Your Ground law is implicated here? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=279.4s)]
*  Obviously, this is a gun crime. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=284.4s)]
*  If this is, in fact, being prosecuted as a crime, this is a shooting that existed, was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=287.12s)]
*  only able to exist because of the gun owner's possession of this weapon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=292.88s)]
*  But the way you are allowed to use your weapon is governed in Missouri according to a law [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=296.08s)]
*  that's designed effectively to prevent home invasion. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=301.28s)]
*  Is something like that going to be implicated here in terms of this young man just having [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=305.48s)]
*  rung the doorbell, posing no threat to this family or this home? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  But nevertheless, those sorts of laws are seen in other places as having muddied the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  waters around encounters like this that end in shootings. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=318.6s)]
*  We have seen the gun lobby change what is core common sense. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  I said this earlier, but I'll repeat it again. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=328.8s)]
*  If this is the sort of thing where Stand Your Ground can be enforced, then every U.S. postal [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=331.36s)]
*  worker, every Amazon delivery person, every pizza delivery person, every Girl Scout volunteer, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  anybody knock it on your door, now becomes somebody who's subject to be shot. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=342.16s)]
*  And I think particularly—and I say this as not just a mayor, not just a person in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  this community, but as a black man and a black father—to recognize the additional risk [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  that black people disproportionately will face because of defenses like this, it concerns [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=357.16s)]
*  me greatly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=363.48s)]
*  So I do hope that this is a case where there is a conviction. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  But more than that, I hope and I pray—I don't know if it will happen—but that some of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=367.98s)]
*  these legislators that have tried to basically allow guns to be everywhere and used in any [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=372.04s)]
*  circumstance and any situation finally say, you know what, this is a kid. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=376.6s)]
*  This is a good kid who did not deserve this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  And what their fetishization of gun laws has done, this expansion of gun rights and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=385.04s)]
*  protections so people are using them outside their cars, outside their homes, now standing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=391.32s)]
*  inside his home, because this guy I think was frankly just scared of a black person [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  at his door, this needs to be pushed back against so we actually have responsible common [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  sense laws that aren't threatening the lives of our sons and daughters in our community. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH--qw-RESs&t=405.28000000000003s)]
