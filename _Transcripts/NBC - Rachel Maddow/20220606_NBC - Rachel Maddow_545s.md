# Ambassador Bridget Brink: U.S. Support For Ukraine 'Now More Important Than Ever'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A)
*  Joining us now is the new United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=0.0s)]
*  She joins us live from the U.S. Embassy in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=4.2s)]
*  Ambassador Brink, I really thank you for being here tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=8.4s)]
*  I appreciate you making the time, especially given what time of the night it is right now [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=10.36s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  RACHEL BRINK, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine to Ukraine [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  Rachel, thanks so much. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=17.04s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=18.04s)]
*  Let me ask you first about the decision to move the embassy back to Kyiv. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=20.96s)]
*  Obviously, that is something that the Ukrainian government wanted and that some other countries [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  have done. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  The United States has done this just within the past few weeks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  You're just there within the past week. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  Is it a physical danger to yourself and other U.S. personnel to have the embassy there, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=36.42s)]
*  particularly with those missiles that we saw Russia shoot into the Ukrainian capital this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=41.18s)]
*  weekend? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=45.82s)]
*  BRIDGET BRINK, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine to Ukraine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=46.82s)]
*  Well, I would just say diplomacy is risky. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=48.82s)]
*  And we are here because we think it's important. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=52.54s)]
*  It's in our national strategic interest to try to ensure that borders are not changed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=56.08s)]
*  by force. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  And to do that job, in part, you need people on the ground. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=62.92s)]
*  So myself and my team, we're very aware of the risks that are at play. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=67.14s)]
*  We very much try to mitigate them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=73.48s)]
*  President Biden, Secretary Blinken, we all have total confidence in efforts that they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=75.92s)]
*  are making to mitigate those risks. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=81.14s)]
*  We tried to do it and I tried to do it myself as ambassador. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=83.54s)]
*  But what I heard on the Hill during my confirmation hearings was from Congress was a lot of interest [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=87.22s)]
*  in getting us back. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  I personally wanted to get back and the president wanted us to be present. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=94.22s)]
*  So I'm proud to be here with a group of very patriotic Americans and to represent the U.S. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=98.5s)]
*  Foreign Service, the diplomatic arm of our government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=104.9s)]
*  We don't fight with weapons. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=109.04s)]
*  We fight with ideas and words. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=111.04s)]
*  My number one job here is to try to help Ukraine defend itself. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=113.12s)]
*  In terms of Ukraine's ability to defend itself, I think that so many Americans who have been [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  horrified by the invasion and who are supportive of the people of Ukraine and what they are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=124.42s)]
*  contending with in this war. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=129.3s)]
*  I live in western New England and in multiple states driving around this part of the country, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=132.02s)]
*  I see people putting out Ukraine flags in front of their houses, not with other political [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=136.3s)]
*  messages or anything, just support for Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=141.4s)]
*  I think because there is so much support for Ukraine in the United States, I worry that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  perhaps the U.S. government, that perhaps the U.S. media is telling the American people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=150.64s)]
*  what they want to hear about Ukraine's likelihood of succeeding in this effort and that we are [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=156.6s)]
*  more interested in hearing about Ukrainian bravery and Ukrainian success and the Russians [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=161.92s)]
*  falling short of expectations than we are in hearing news to the contrary. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=168.1s)]
*  Is that fair to worry about that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  And do you have a different view of how things are going in the war now, these 100 days into it? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=174.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually a great question. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=182.18s)]
*  I mean, there is no doubt that due to Ukrainian bravery and ingenuity, the Russians have had [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  to pull back and refocus on the East and the South of the country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=190.3s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=194.58s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=195.58s)]
*  It's a David and Goliath story that's in real life. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  The president, the president is incredibly brave and is leading his people in this resistance [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  to this unprovoked aggression. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  But also the average person on the ground is resisting as well. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=209.44s)]
*  So I think that it's what's happening now in the East is the fighting, as your intro [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=215.24s)]
*  said, is very close, very difficult. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  The Americans are losing a lot of soldiers every day. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=224.86s)]
*  It's why it's so important that we work with partners and allies to continue to provide [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=227.74s)]
*  as much security assistance as they need to prevail, to defend themselves. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing on the ground and working with, of course, Washington and then [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  other allies and partners that are on the ground here in Kiev. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=244.02s)]
*  But yes, this is going, I guess what I would say to the American people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  I felt this overwhelming support just for our presence, for our team that is here, for [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=251.36s)]
*  our people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=256.96s)]
*  When I was back in America, I felt it obviously from the administration, but also from Congress [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=258.52s)]
*  and also from the Midwest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=263.24s)]
*  And I felt it from friends and family that I grew up with. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=265.56s)]
*  So that's great. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=269.4s)]
*  I would just say this is not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=270.4s)]
*  And I think it's now a very difficult battle in the East. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's now more important than ever that we continue to offer this support. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=279.54s)]
*  With the Russian Federation handing out Russian passports to Ukrainians who live in the East, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=286.94s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin recognizing the purported independence of parts of Eastern and Southeastern [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=292.62s)]
*  Ukraine, with Russian occupying forces telling Ukrainians they need to trade in the ruble [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=300.14s)]
*  and replacing Ukrainian education and media outlets with those that are derived from Russia, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=306.72s)]
*  it does seem like Putin is trying to make the Russian takeover of large parts of Ukraine [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=314.92s)]
*  the de facto way of life in that part of the country. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=320.88s)]
*  President Zelensky has talked about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory now being occupied [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=326.24s)]
*  by Russian forces. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=330.92s)]
*  Is it the position of the U.S. government that any diplomatic solution, any potential [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  ceasefire has to respect the original integrity of Ukraine's borders? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=338.46s)]
*  Or is it possible that Ukraine is going to lose large swaths of its territory in negotiations [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=343.73999999999995s)]
*  to end the war? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=350.02s)]
*  Well, you've got it exactly right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=353.82s)]
*  This is part of the Russian playbook in terms of the giving out passports and incorporating [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=356.02s)]
*  parts of countries into Russia. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=362.36s)]
*  This is what has happened in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, among other places [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  in this part of the world. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  So it's not surprising. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=372.36s)]
*  The United States has long recognized Ukraine, Ukraine within its international borders, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  and we also consider Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=380.68s)]
*  So we are letting the Ukrainians decide when or how they will negotiate, as President Zelensky [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=387.62s)]
*  said and President Biden also affirmed. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=394.74s)]
*  All wars end in some kind of negotiation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=398.3s)]
*  But we're supporting Ukraine as it fights right now to defend itself. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=400.94s)]
*  How important are the new advanced weapons that President Biden has approved sending [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=407.66s)]
*  to Ukraine? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=413.14s)]
*  I think for those of us who don't come from a military background, we hear about, you [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=414.14s)]
*  know, anti-tank weapons. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=417.42s)]
*  We hear about artillery. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=418.72s)]
*  We hear about howitzers. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=421.88s)]
*  We're now hearing about guided rocket systems. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=423.72s)]
*  As the type of weapons and the amount of weaponry that the United States sends continues to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=427.0s)]
*  expand, is there something that we civilians should understand in terms of the enhanced [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=431.76s)]
*  capability that we are offering the Ukrainians by giving them these more advanced weapons [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=438.04s)]
*  that are newly arriving now? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=442.94s)]
*  Well, they are very important, and it really signifies, I think, our support because they [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  are advanced weaponry. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=451.26s)]
*  They also signify the way in which the battle has changed from what was required in Kiev, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=453.34s)]
*  in the capital, when there was fighting in urban areas, where now it's fighting in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  Donbas, which is the area in the east, and it's very flat. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=467.9s)]
*  And so the fighting is basically artillery. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=471.62s)]
*  And it's from many from far away. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=474.62s)]
*  Positions are far away from each other. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=478.72s)]
*  So this this weaponry is more appropriate for the current fight. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=480.68s)]
*  We also hope that allies and partners will also support Ukraine with this kind of weaponry. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=484.56s)]
*  And we will continue our very, very close consultations with them in order to adjust [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=492.16s)]
*  the security assistance that we're providing to meet the needs that they have. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  The United States Ambassador to Ukraine is Brigitte Brink. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fsc5o4dI5A&t=502.68s)]
