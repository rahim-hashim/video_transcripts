# Classified Documents At Heart Of FBI Search Of Trump's Mar-a-Lago
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ)
*  I mean, the former president is at least potentially implicated in an ongoing federal grand jury [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  criminal investigation into sending forged sets of fake electors to the electoral college [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=5.04s)]
*  to keep him in power. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=12.36s)]
*  There's a federal grand jury looking at that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=13.52s)]
*  He's also potentially implicated in another federal grand jury investigation into efforts [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=15.52s)]
*  to use the Justice Department itself to overthrow the election results from 2020 and keep him [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=19.76s)]
*  in power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  A second federal grand jury is reportedly looking at that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  He's also potentially implicated in another federal grand jury investigation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=29.44s)]
*  This one first reported in May by the New York Times into the alleged serious mishandling [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=33.44s)]
*  of classified information by the former president. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=38.04s)]
*  Now, the Times was first to report the existence of the federal grand jury investigation into [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=41.24s)]
*  this matter, but it was the Washington Post that was first to report six months ago in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=45.56s)]
*  February that Trump had taken boxes and boxes and boxes of government documents and materials [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=49.64s)]
*  with him to South Florida to his house club hotel thing called Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=55.0s)]
*  The Post reported, again, back in February, that many of the documents that he took with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=61.84s)]
*  him to Mar-a-Lago were definitely and unequivocally classified. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=66.52s)]
*  Now, that's important because there are criminal penalties that attach to mishandling [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=71.28s)]
*  or allowing unauthorized access to classified government documents. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=77.8s)]
*  get in trouble for mishandling classified government documents all the time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=81.68s)]
*  Washington Post reporting team, led in part by Jackie Alamany, was first to report on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=87.56s)]
*  how highly classified some of these documents were that Trump took with him to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=92.28s)]
*  I mean, a classified document is a classified document and criminal penalties sort of therein [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  attach just by the fact that something is classified. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=105.78s)]
*  But Jackie Alamany and her colleagues at the Post were first to report that some of these [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=109.64s)]
*  documents that he took were really, really, really classified. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=114.16s)]
*  And we know that in part because the National Archives subsequently had to go retrieve them [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=119.28s)]
*  and make an inventory of what they found. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=124.16s)]
*  Some of these documents were so classified they couldn't even list them in an inventory. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=126.08s)]
*  They couldn't describe what kind of documents they were if the inventory itself was going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=130.32s)]
*  to be an unclassified document. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=136.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=138.6s)]
*  I mean, here's the headline from Jackie Alamany and her colleague Tom Hamburger from February [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=139.6s)]
*  25th of this year. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=143.44s)]
*  Quote, some records taken by Trump are so sensitive they may not be described in public. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=144.56s)]
*  Quote, some of the presidential records recovered from former President Donald Trump's residence [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=151.0s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago are so sensitive they may not be able to be described in forthcoming inventory [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=155.36s)]
*  reports in an unclassified way. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=160.76s)]
*  According to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=163.0s)]
*  to discuss a sensitive topic, there are records at the very highest levels of classification, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=166.28s)]
*  including some that can be viewed by only a small number of government officials. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=172.6s)]
*  Quote, there are records that only a very few have clearances to review. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=176.6s)]
*  The documents are so sensitive that officials may not be able to describe them in an unclassified [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=181.08s)]
*  way according to the two people who spoke to the Washington Post. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=187.44s)]
*  In other words, one of the federal grand juries looking into former President Donald Trump [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  has been looking at this issue of potentially mishandling classified information. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  The existence of the federal grand jury looking into that as a potential criminal matter was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=201.76s)]
*  first reported in May by the New York Times. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=205.64s)]
*  But the Washington Post reported back in February that what he took to Mar-a-Lago, these boxes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=208.1s)]
*  and boxes and boxes of documents, which the National Archives tried for a long time to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  get back before they were finally able to get them from him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=219.24s)]
*  This is apparently such a, some of this at least, is stuff of such high classification [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=222.36s)]
*  that not only can you and I not know the content of these documents, you can't know any of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=227.3s)]
*  the words that are in the document, you can't know about the existence of the document, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=232.3s)]
*  you can't have the type of document it is described to you unless you have a very high [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=236.58s)]
*  level government clearance. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=241.22s)]
*  It's that classified. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=242.9s)]
*  And that's what he took to like the golf course, golf club thing or whatever it is, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=243.9s)]
*  the supper club, whatever it is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  His gold thing in South Florida. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=253.1s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting tonight that it is the classified documents investigation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=257.38s)]
*  that led to today's FBI raid, that led to the execution of this search warrant at the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=261.94s)]
*  former president's property. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=265.78s)]
*  It was Jackie Alamany and her colleagues at the Post who first reported the existence [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=267.54s)]
*  of this problem and its seriousness. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=270.82s)]
*  As we continue to follow this breaking news story tonight, it is a remarkable advance [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=272.98s)]
*  that the FBI is taking public-facing steps in this investigation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=280.22s)]
*  We've known this investigation was underway for several months. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=284.38s)]
*  Them executing this search warrant today in South Florida has all sorts of implications [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=287.18s)]
*  as to the seriousness of this matter. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=291.62s)]
*  In broad historical terms, today will always be the day that you and I and all of us learned [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=294.22s)]
*  that a former president of the United States had been raided by the FBI. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=298.94s)]
*  Joining us now is Jackie Alamany, Investigations Reporter for The Washington Post. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=304.94s)]
*  Ms. Alamany, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=308.5s)]
*  This feels like maybe not full circle, but quite a ways around the arc from your initial reporting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=316.66s)]
*  I know that you and your colleagues have been continuing to report this story. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=320.26s)]
*  You were first to break the news of this scandal six months ago. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=322.86s)]
*  What do you understand about the latest here, about the scope of the FBI's action and what [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=326.1s)]
*  it says about this investigation as a whole? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=331.42s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=334.26s)]
*  Well, we're trying to get new details right now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=334.82s)]
*  And what we've heard so far is that at which the former president confirmed himself is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=338.46s)]
*  that the FBI did raid the premises today. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  This is an especially newsworthy development, though, because obviously six months ago, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  we reported that the National Archives had sent people down to Mar-a-Lago to recover [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  about 15 boxes worth of documents, classified information and various mementos, things, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=360.74s)]
*  records that belong to the American people from former President Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  The FBI revisiting him today indicates that there might have been documents that have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=372.58s)]
*  yet to have been recovered. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=380.1s)]
*  We have no reporting yet on what exactly might have been taken, what FBI agents were looking [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=381.66s)]
*  for. But some new reporting that we do have is that the inventory that was turned over [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=388.38s)]
*  to the FBI of those 15 boxes was actually 100 pages long. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=393.86s)]
*  And that was only of the unclassified information, unclassified items that were improperly taken. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=399.1s)]
*  Although if you if you asked any archivist, they would say that that information is just as [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=405.62s)]
*  important to our historic record as some of the classified information that was taken. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=410.46s)]
*  We have a source telling us that if you quantified the unclassified version of the classified [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=415.58000000000004s)]
*  inventory, which would be a separate inventory from the list of unclassified items, that it would be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=422.82s)]
*  around three pages long. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=429.38s)]
*  But the source added that volume is just one way to quantify the damage that might have been done, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=431.22s)]
*  and that even just one page or one portion of a top secret or classified item that might have been [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=438.74s)]
*  improperly archived could do very grave damage to national security of the U.S. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=446.02s)]
*  Let me make sure that I understand this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  So the National Archives was able to retrieve about 15 boxes of material from Mar-a-Lago already. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  They then produced two different inventories of that material that they recovered and handed it to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=462.94s)]
*  the FBI, a 100 page inventory of just the unclassified material that was improperly taken and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=468.02s)]
*  then a three page inventory of the classified material that was taken. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  And that, again, the National Archives made that inventory and gave it to the FBI. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=478.46s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=481.85999999999996s)]
*  That that's right. We don't actually know how many inventories exist overall, but we do know of at least [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=483.46s)]
*  two unclassified inventories, one of the unclassified items and then the unclassified version of the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=490.14s)]
*  classified items, because even describing classified items can sometimes needs to be classified. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=496.42s)]
*  And these are these are rough estimates around 100 pages worth of items. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=504.26s)]
*  We actually have some descriptors of some of the unclassified items, things like birthday dinner menu was taken, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=509.86s)]
*  schedules, calendars, speeches, agendas, talking points. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=516.98s)]
*  We were still digging into this again every minute sitting here getting text messages and new intel just as we speak. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=522.5s)]
*  But it's helping at least understand the full scope of what the FBI could be looking for here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=532.46s)]
*  I don't want to keep you. I know this is an actor. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=542.18s)]
*  Here's the story you're actively working on right now, and I promise I will not keep you too long so you can look at all those [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=544.02s)]
*  text and advance your work with your colleagues. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=548.5799999999999s)]
*  But I do I do want to make sure that I understand what we know about this in terms of the National Archives and what they've done already. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=551.4599999999999s)]
*  Did the National Archives have a fight with Trump over some of these things that he did not believe were improperly taken, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=556.9399999999999s)]
*  that he thought he had a right to? Was it hard for them to get stuff back from him? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=564.38s)]
*  Is is that perhaps the origin of any things that were held back? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=569.02s)]
*  That sort of conflict, the origin of any things that were held back by him that the FBI might have been looking to retrieve today. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=575.5s)]
*  So that is a really good question. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=581.54s)]
*  And clearly you have been reading the reporting extremely closely because six months ago when we first broke this story, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=583.34s)]
*  the reason why it actually became an issue was because the National Archives, as they do for the public record, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=590.22s)]
*  is they go through all of the documents from a presidency, put it all together, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=597.54s)]
*  make sure it's very clearly organized. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=603.5s)]
*  And during that process, which takes decades, there are still at times these archivists are going back to former presidencies [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=605.3s)]
*  that in the 70s and the 80s is when they find new historic records that need to be preserved correctly. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=615.3s)]
*  But what they realized when they were going through the Trump White House's record was that there were documents that were missing, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=623.18s)]
*  that were publicly known and fairly infamous, had gained notoriety throughout the course of the Trump presidency, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=630.1800000000001s)]
*  including, for example, that letter from Kim Jong Un, that the North Korean dictator that famously wrote former President Trump a letter [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=636.94s)]
*  while he was in office, that it was missing from the records. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=646.26s)]
*  And that prompted them to get in touch with Trump's counsel that was representing him post presidency to say, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=650.1800000000001s)]
*  hey, guys, we're missing a bunch of records. Do you have them? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=658.18s)]
*  There was then back and forth that that was fairly extended. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=662.22s)]
*  I'm not quite sure. I'm not quite remembering the time period. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=666.9399999999999s)]
*  But, you know, this is a president that that left the White House in January and these records were not retrieved until the beginning of this year. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=670.62s)]
*  So there was some extensive back and forth. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=678.66s)]
*  And the former president was very reticent about giving up some of these documents. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=680.66s)]
*  And the volume of 15 boxes alone was quite an astonishing number at the time. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=686.34s)]
*  And there was in that back and forth an agreement that the former president would continue to hand over documents as they found them. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=692.7s)]

*  Again, I know that you are in the middle of ongoing reporting on this story, which, of course, you and your colleagues helped break from the first place. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=706.34s)]
*  Call us back over the course of this hour as you as you learn more. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=712.14s)]
*  Obviously, we're going to be covering this as closely as we possibly can. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=716.4200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EajmUKVzLLQ&t=719.02s)]
