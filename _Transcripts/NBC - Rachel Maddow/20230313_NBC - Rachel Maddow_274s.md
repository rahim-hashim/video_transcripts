# As Florida county bans Holocaust book, actual neo-Nazis grow bold in U.S.
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE)
*  Chances are you've heard of an American author named Jodi Pico. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=0.0s)]
*  Perhaps you've read one of her books or a bunch of them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=4.68s)]
*  There's a whole bunch. She's published nearly 30 books. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=7.0s)]
*  She sold tens of millions of books. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=9.0s)]
*  She's a New York Times bestselling author many times over. She's huge. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=10.76s)]
*  A few days ago, Jodi Pico was shocked to learn that one of her books has now been banned. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=14.96s)]
*  The book is called The Storyteller. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=20.16s)]
*  It's a book about the Holocaust. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=22.36s)]
*  A county in Florida has now banned it from its school libraries [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=24.16s)]
*  under Republican Governor Ron DeSantis' broad, vague new laws [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=29.52s)]
*  covering what kids can and cannot read. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=33.92s)]
*  Jodi Pico responded with this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=36.8s)]
*  She said, quote, The Storyteller is a novel about the Holocaust. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=39.56s)]
*  It chronicles the growth of anti-Semitism and fascism in Nazi Germany. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=42.4s)]
*  It was a strange irony that a parent wanted this particular book removed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=46.32s)]
*  because it felt a bit like history repeating itself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  That feeling, that stuff we thought maybe we had left behind is rearing its head again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=53.96s)]
*  That feeling is happening a lot these days. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=58.64s)]
*  Last week, House Republicans held a hearing supposedly on the origins of COVID-19. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=61.76s)]
*  They invited as their expert witness this guy, famous for writing a book that claims, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=68.0s)]
*  among other things, that Jewish people are genetically evolved. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=73.0s)]
*  They are biologically programmed to love money. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=77.08s)]
*  That was their expert who they brought in on the science of COVID. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, here's a picture of former President Trump's adult son, Eric. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=85.2s)]
*  He's the one on the left, the blonde one there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=90.64s)]
*  Here he is hanging out with a guy who he's now traveling the country with. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=93.0s)]
*  The guy on his left, our right, is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=96.48s)]
*  who says the Jews did 9-11 and that Hitler was fighting, quote, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=100.92s)]
*  and that Hitler was fighting, quote, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=106.64s)]
*  Eric Trump and this Jews did 9-11 guy are traveling the country now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=114.44s)]
*  as part of something called the Reawaken America Tour. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=118.48s)]
*  In May, that roadshow will be taking over one of Donald Trump's Florida properties for a weekend. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=122.12s)]
*  This weekend in Florida, police issued citations to five men [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=128.76s)]
*  for dumping hundreds of anti-Semitic neo-Nazi flyers around a neighborhood in West Palm Beach. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=132.6s)]
*  The men were not arrested. They were ticketed for littering. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=139.16s)]
*  NPR this weekend just reported on a group of self-described Nazis [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=143.04s)]
*  who have been projecting giant five-story tall swastikas and other anti-Semitic imagery [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  on tall buildings in the city of Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=153.12s)]
*  And then there was Ohio this weekend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=157.76s)]
*  Right-wing extremists, white supremacist groups have lately been targeting drag queen story hours. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=159.76s)]
*  But what happened in Ohio this weekend was a different order of magnitude. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=166.52s)]
*  One drag queen storytelling event in a park in the town of Wadsworth, Ohio, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=170.04s)]
*  drew hundreds of protesters, including lots and lots of full-on neo-Nazis, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=175.4s)]
*  many of them armed, lots of them carrying swastika flags and shouting, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=182.16s)]
*  I'm going to show you a little bit of footage that we've obtained from the event, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=187.8s)]
*  just a little bit, because I don't really want to give these guys the publicity they crave. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=190.8s)]
*  But I do want to show you just a few seconds so you can get a sense of how unnerving this must have been for that community. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=194.4s)]
*  Probably goes without saying, you may find this footage upsetting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=205.52s)]
*  So they're doing sig-hile, sig-hile, and you hear them saying Weimar conditions, Weimar solutions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=216.8s)]
*  They're talking about Hitler, right? Hitler overthrew the Weimar Republic. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=223.8s)]
*  You all know what Hitler's solution was. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=227.8s)]
*  Again, these guys are out in numbers and in force screaming at Ohio kids this weekend. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=230.8s)]
*  We've got some folks on the right trying to ban books about the rise of Nazism and the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=238.8s)]
*  In 1930s Germany, while others are literally trying to make it happen all over again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYLvZs-crzE&t=245.8s)]
