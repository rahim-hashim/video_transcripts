# Race Hard To Ignore In Sentencing Differences In Voting Cases
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM)
*  The messages read, quote, This fight is about the fundamental fairness and integrity of our election system. The nation is depending upon your continued resolve. Stay strong and keep fighting Mr President. And we need ammo. We need fraud examples. We need it this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=0.0s)]
*  As we've been talking about tonight, those are just two of about 100 messages sent by Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Republican Congressman Chip Roy of Texas to then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows shortly after the election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=16.0s)]
*  The texts were reported by CNN. NBC News has not independently verified those texts. The two lawmakers were encouraging Meadows to do everything he could to bolster the president's claims that the 2020 election was stolen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=28.0s)]
*  Find the proof. Find the ammo. We know for sure now that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in any state that impacted the election results. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=40.0s)]
*  But we learned this week that Mark Meadows might have been able to offer up his own ballot as the example of voter fraud his friends so desperately sought. The former chief of staff was removed from the voting roles in North Carolina after state election fraud investigators found that he was registered in both North Carolina and Virginia. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=49.0s)]
*  He last voted in North Carolina in 2020. His registration is tied to a single wide mobile home that there is no evidence of him ever actually living in. The State Bureau of Investigation is still investigating. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=67.0s)]
*  We will see if he faces any consequences, which is an open question when you look at the history of who tends to face real consequences for behavior like this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=79.0s)]
*  Over in Florida, two men from a retirement community called the Villages are facing their own consequences for their admitted voter fraud. The two men pled guilty this week to casting multiple ballots for the 2020 election, a felony that carries a maximum five-year prison sentence. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=88.0s)]
*  They were sentenced to 50 hours of community service and a 12-week adult civics class, among some other requirements. As long as they manage that, they will face no further punishments for voter fraud. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=104.0s)]
*  Those kinds of light sentences for white guys who knowingly cast fraudulent ballots seem to be a trend. There was Bruce Bartman of Pennsylvania who cast an absentee ballot for Donald Trump under his dead mother's name. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=115.0s)]
*  He got five years probation. Then there was Edward Snodgrass, a Republican official from Ohio. He cast an extra ballot for his dead father. He got three days in jail and a $500 fine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=127.0s)]
*  Then there was another man from Pennsylvania, Robert Richard Lynn, who applied for an absentee ballot under his dead mother's name. He got six months probation. There was also Donald Kirk Hartle from Nevada who cast a ballot for his dead wife. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=139.0s)]
*  He got a year's probation. And then there's Crystal Mason, a black woman from Texas who cast a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. She was on supervised release for a federal conviction at the time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=153.0s)]
*  She did not know she could not vote. She maintains that no one told her that she could not vote before her federal supervised release ended. Her ballot was ultimately never counted. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=165.0s)]
*  Again, it was provisional and it was rejected. And yet she was sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to vote. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=174.0s)]
*  Late in 2020, Crystal Mason filed a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to review her conviction. And last year, the All Republican Court agreed to the review. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=183.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Crystal Mason, the Texas woman who is appealing her five-year prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=193.0s)]
*  Crystal Mason, thank you so much for joining us on the show tonight. We know that Mark Meadows is being investigated. We know that Mark Meadows is being investigated for voter fraud. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=202.0s)]
*  The former Trump White House Chief of Staff. I mentioned a bunch of other men who were investigated, charged, found guilty, pled guilty, and they didn't really get any prison time or prison sentences. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=211.0s)]
*  And then this happened to you. The outcome for them so different to your outcome. What do you make of it all? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=221.0s)]
*  This really saddens me. Saddens me on what type of justice system we have here today. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=228.0s)]
*  Obviously, it shows that I was pretty much target. And right now, five years later, go ahead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=234.0s)]
*  No, I was just wondering if you think it's I'm going to ask. I'm just going to ask the question straight up. Do you think it's because they're white men and you're a black woman? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=246.0s)]
*  Of course. Of course, you can see plain as day that it is. It's a different system. It's a different system. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=254.0s)]
*  It is indeed. And I wonder what is happening in terms of the system that you're dealing with right now. What is the latest on your fight to get your conviction overturned? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=264.0s)]
*  We know that last year, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed to review your case. They're going to rely on legal briefs rather than oral arguments. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=276.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about what you've heard from them? What happens next? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=284.0s)]
*  Well, right now, five years later, I've been out on a pill for five years fighting to stay free. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=289.0s)]
*  And I'm at the criminal courts of appeal. And just imagine waking up every Wednesday to see if you stay free or if you go to prison. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=295.0s)]
*  It's overwhelming for me and my family. I think we lost you for a moment there, Crystal. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=306.0s)]
*  Let me let me ask you this before we run out of time very quickly. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=312.0s)]
*  Does it worry you that if someone can so easily make an innocent mistake at the polls as you did and be sent to jail for five years while other people are deliberately carrying out fraud and nothing's happening to them? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=315.0s)]
*  People like yourself, people who look like you from backgrounds like yourself, who might be not not be obviously Republican voters, as some of these guys were that I mentioned, they're going to be intimidated into not voting. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=324.0s)]
*  They're going to say, well, it's not worth the hassle to go out and vote. And maybe that's the goal of all this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=335.0s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. I feel like the goal is to scare the black and brown away from the poll. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=340.0s)]
*  And if you look at the cases, you can kind of see from little to no consequences at all on true real voter fraud cases. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=347.0s)]
*  And yet I filled out a provision of ballot and never counted. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=356.0s)]
*  And I'm sentenced to five years for illegally voting, but never voting. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=360.0s)]
*  Crystal Mason, we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=365.0s)]
*  We wish you well with your appeal against your sentence for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=368.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the show tonight. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=373.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=375.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BqYBgaddqM&t=395.0s)]
