# Disgraced Trump NSA Flynn Proposed Using National Guard To Seize Voting Machines: NYT
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA)
*  The show has been tracking all week the different ways Donald Trump and his allies were actively trying this whole seize the voting machines thing in the wake of the 2020 election as part of their kitchen sink strategy to overthrow the government. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, today, another layer of the onion peeled off. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=14.0s)]
*  Emails and records obtained by CBS News suggests there were multiple versions of draft orders that called for the seizure of voting machines after the 2020 presidential election. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=18.0s)]
*  This draft order dated December 17th would have empowered the Secretary of Homeland Security to seize, collect, preserve, protect, retain and analyze all machines. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=29.0s)]
*  A day earlier, another draft order reviewed by CBS News looked to grant similar powers to the defense secretary. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=40.0s)]
*  The draft, which contains one typo and no signature line for President Trump, is dated December 16th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=48.0s)]
*  Now that draft executive order apparently prepared for President Trump, that would have approved the seizure of voting machines. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=55.0s)]
*  It was sent to a small group of the president's supporters who were working to overthrow the election. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=62.0s)]
*  One of the people on that seize the voting machines email chain was Michael Flynn, Donald Trump's disgraced national security adviser. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=67.0s)]
*  CBS News obtained an email from Michael Flynn back then in regard to that draft executive order. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=74.0s)]
*  He wrote, quote, Fix the spelling error in the title and sure it gets a legal review, but this is ready to go from my standpoint, end quote. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=80.0s)]
*  Paired with that report from CBS, we also today learned in this deeply reported piece from Robert Draper at the New York Times magazine that Michael Flynn was not just a proofreader on the seize the machines plan. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=89.0s)]
*  He was an active participant with a very specific strategy in mind. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=100.0s)]
*  Quote, while Trump friendly lawyer Sidney Powell was pursuing legal options for reversing the election results, Flynn was beginning to envision a military role. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=105.0s)]
*  By mid-December, Flynn was calling for sending in the military to the content contested states. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=115.0s)]
*  By December 16th, one of the president's allies had lined up a series of options for the president to consider, including using uniformed officials to confiscate voting machines and ballots in six states. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=121.0s)]
*  Flynn suggested that the National Guard and U.S. Marshals in combination would be the most suited to the job. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=135.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=143.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Robert Draper, continuing contributing writer for the New York Times magazine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=144.0s)]
*  He's the author of this new deeply reported piece about Michael Flynn out in the Times today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=148.0s)]
*  He's also the author of the book To Start a War, How the Bush Administration Took America into Iraq. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=154.0s)]
*  Mr. Draper, thank you for being with us this evening. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=160.0s)]
*  My pleasure, Ali. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=163.0s)]
*  I have to say in reading your story, if I didn't know that most of this was true based on leaks we'd have or things we'd understood, it feels made up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=165.0s)]
*  It feels like a screenplay. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=175.0s)]
*  I actually want to read a passage for our viewers just to set the scene. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=177.0s)]
*  You say that Flynn was encamped at the historic estate in South Carolina owned by Lin Wood, the Trump supporting defamation lawyer who sued over Georgia's election results. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=181.0s)]
*  Flynn had flown to South Carolina on the private jet of the former Overstock chief, Executive Patrick Byrne, and set up camp where he threw himself into the project of reversing the results of the election that Trump had just lost. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=191.0s)]
*  Sidney Powell brought along two law associates. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=203.0s)]
*  The other guests were there to gather and organize election information alongside her and Flynn. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=206.0s)]
*  Among these was Seth Keschel, a 36-year-old former Army military intelligence captain who told me he got Flynn's attention three weeks earlier by sending what he believed were suspicious election data to Flynn's LinkedIn page. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=211.0s)]
*  Another, Jim Penrose, was a cybersecurity specialist who had worked for the National Security Agency. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=225.0s)]
*  A third, Doug Logan, was an associate of Byrne and the chief executive of a Florida-based software security firm called Cyber Ninjas. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=232.0s)]
*  Wood and Byrne said the group had brought computers, printers, and whiteboards. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=241.0s)]
*  Quote, it looked like Election Central, Wood recalled. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=246.0s)]
*  That's remarkable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=249.0s)]
*  Yeah, basically they spent Thanksgiving there and several days beyond that compiling supposed evidence of fraud that they were getting over the transom through open sources, through people submitting affidavits and the like. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=252.0s)]
*  And once they were compiling all of this, Ali, after they had done that, then they began to imagine, OK, since we believe we've conclusively proved fraud, then how can this be used as a basis for President Trump to reverse the election? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=265.0s)]
*  And that in turn is what led to this military option he referred to before, where General Flynn was promoting the idea that voting machines and backup ballots could be seized in six contested states using the National Guard because they had a very good cybersecurity unit in them and the US Marshals. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=278.0s)]
*  And then once they had these machines and these ballots, then if President Trump wanted, he could have on live stream TV all of them to be hand recounted and then the chips would supposedly fall where they may. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=302.0s)]
*  But Flynn had said on a TV show roughly around this time, look, this is not that big a deal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=314.0s)]
*  Marshal laws happen 64 times or so. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=320.0s)]
*  But of course, the idea of sitting president, having just lost an election, essentially saying I don't like the outcome of this election and therefore seizing using the military, all of the ballots on the contested states to order a recount truly unqualified is exceptional. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=323.0s)]
*  There were, according to your reporting, there were enough people around there who were trying to outdo each other for who had the most dubious legal advice. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=340.0s)]
*  But what was happening with Donald Trump? Was he trying to find the answer he wanted that would keep him as president? Or did he really believe there was fraud? What would all these recounts and seizing the machines do? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=349.0s)]
*  You know, it's a bunch of different questions. There's a bunch of different answers on the question of whether or not President Trump believed that there was fraud. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=361.0s)]
*  It's hard to get into the guy's psyche. I have talked to people who said that at times when they spoke to the president, they felt like he was kind of in on the joke, knew basically that election fraud had not occurred. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=369.0s)]
*  But he certainly put on a convincing case of believing that there was fraud to other people. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=379.0s)]
*  I don't think that he was willing, however, to go to every conceivable means for whatever reason, though, as you referenced, Trump was interested in looking at, say, the Department of Justice, perhaps seizing the machines than the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=383.0s)]
*  The military option was one that seemed to bother him. And Patrick Byrne, the Overstock CEO, told me that he had a conversation later with Rudy Giuliani, and Giuliani had told Byrne why he had advised Trump not to go with the military option. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=395.0s)]
*  He said, we will all end up in prison if we do that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=411.0s)]
*  Robert, we cannot do justice to the amount of reporting that you did in that fantastic piece, so I do recommend to our viewers that they read it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=414.0s)]
*  But thank you for being with us. Robert Draper is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=420.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWO--Y1d6SA&t=441.0s)]
