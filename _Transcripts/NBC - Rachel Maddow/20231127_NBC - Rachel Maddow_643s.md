# Republican threat to Fani Willis runs into legal wall at state supreme court
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28)
*  Hey, so here's some good news that you may not have heard anywhere else. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=0.0s)]
*  Good news in terms of us being a small d democracy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=3.94s)]
*  So as a general matter, one big fundamental threat to democracy and the rule of law is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=9.4s)]
*  when the justice system and law enforcement has to bow to the powerful. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  When prosecutors who investigate powerful people or who bring charges against powerful [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=21.26s)]
*  people find themselves targeted for doing so. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=25.16s)]
*  When prosecutors learn to expect that if you investigate or indict someone with political [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=29.52s)]
*  power that will likely get you attacked and potentially removed from your job. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=33.4s)]
*  That dynamic is a very dangerous, very corrosive thing to the rule of law and therefore to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=39.44s)]
*  democracy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  And this past year, Republicans in the great state of Georgia gave themselves the ability [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  to pursue that exact course of action. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=53.06s)]
*  Around the time that the high profile, high stakes investigation of former president Donald [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=56.82s)]
*  Trump was starting to bear fruit in the state of Georgia, the Republican dominated legislature [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=61.3s)]
*  in that state drafted a new law giving themselves new power, giving themselves a new commission [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=66.7s)]
*  that they would populate that they would direct. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=74.22s)]
*  And that commission would have the power to remove prosecutors in the middle of their [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=79.42s)]
*  terms in office. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=83.96s)]
*  And the legislators who proposed this, some of them at least, were not shy about saying [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=86.82s)]
*  explicitly that the purpose of this or at least their intent once this thing passed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=94.13999999999999s)]
*  would be to use it to go after Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis, who has been [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=101.78s)]
*  leading the giant racketeering prosecution against former president Trump for allegedly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=106.25999999999999s)]
*  interfering in Georgia's elections. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=110.74s)]
*  They've given themselves the power effectively to remove prosecutors and they did so right [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=113.46s)]
*  when a prosecutor brought charges against Donald Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  Are they going to try to use it? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, we might just have gotten an answer to that question very quietly on Thanksgiving [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=125.36s)]
*  Eve while almost no one was looking. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  A very big deal thing happened in Georgia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=134.92s)]
*  The Georgia Supreme Court ruled on this issue and they said that this law that the Republican [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  passed that effectively gave them the ability to remove prosecutors, the Supreme Court [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=143.46s)]
*  said that this law cannot work as written. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=149.34s)]
*  The court fundamentally declined to approve specific rules for how this commission would [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=153.22s)]
*  function in the real world. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=160.0s)]
*  That decision has the practical effect of at least looking like it might kill this effort [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=162.46s)]
*  to oust Fannie Willis as the Fulton County prosecutor unless Georgia Republican lawmakers [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=167.82s)]
*  go back to the drawing board and kind of start over with this thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=172.68s)]
*  Here's how the Atlanta Journal-Constitution described it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=176.76s)]
*  Oh wait, they can still overhaul the measure? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=197.16s)]
*  Are they going to try to do that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=199.44s)]
*  Joining us now is Professor Clark Cunningham. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  He's a professor of law at Georgia State University. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=203.66s)]
*  He's an expert in legal ethics and constitutional law and he is a professor we have called on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  in the past to help us understand this dynamic at Georgia. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  Professor Cunningham, I'm really grateful you could be here tonight. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=213.62s)]
*  Thanks for your time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=216.18s)]
*  Glad to be with you, Rachel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=217.18s)]
*  So the ruling from the Supreme Court on Thanksgiving Eve on Wednesday effectively said, we do not [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=220.18s)]
*  believe that we as the court have the power to establish the rules by which this commission [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  would do this work. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=233.36s)]
*  Is that a fair layman's way to summarize what they did? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=234.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  The law that was passed by the Georgia legislature last spring provided that the rules that would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=240.28s)]
*  put the commission into business had to be first approved by the Georgia Supreme Court [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=247.16s)]
*  and the Georgia Supreme Court announced on Thanksgiving Eve that they weren't going to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=252.56s)]
*  do that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=256.36s)]
*  And therefore the commission cannot proceed at this point. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=257.36s)]
*  In terms of the overall, like sort of where that puts us on the board game, like on the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  shoots and ladders here, how close we are to the end, if the ultimate goal of this that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of observers like me worry about is that this would give the legislature effectively, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=273.38s)]
*  indirectly but would effectively give them the power to remove prosecutors who are doing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=280.3s)]
*  things they don't like. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=284.18s)]
*  Does this bring things right back to square one, right back to the beginning of the board? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=286.24s)]
*  Or is there an opportunity for the legislature to respond to the court effectively and in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=291.92s)]
*  short order in a way that would put this back on track? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=299.64s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not clear what the next steps are going to be. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen before the end of the year because the Georgia legislature is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=308.68s)]
*  a part time legislature and so they won't be back in business for this probably until [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=312.2s)]
*  the new year. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=317.32s)]
*  They're meeting for redistricting right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=318.32s)]
*  You know, one legislator who was very much a proponent of the bill has apparently been [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=321.28s)]
*  quoted as saying this is a quick fix that they can get it done in January. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=327.26s)]
*  But this bill has really brought an outlash of criticism from some unexpected places. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=331.48s)]
*  Both the district attorneys association and what are called the solicitor generals in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Georgia, both those associations have come out strongly opposed to the bill. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  The national prosecuting attorneys council has come out opposed to the bill. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  And I don't know that the legislature expected prosecutors, who are generally I think favorites [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=354.04s)]
*  of our legislature, to be so strongly opposed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=360.88s)]
*  And there are a lot of problems with the bill which was passed in a very hasty way, not [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=364.48s)]
*  just the glitch that the Supreme Court identified, but there are other problems with the bill [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=369.36s)]
*  as well. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=373.6s)]
*  And I think it's quite possible that it might be the legislature will abandon this project [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=374.8s)]
*  or if not, they'll have to do some significant reworking of the bill so that the commission [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=380.24s)]
*  doesn't have as much unregulated power as it seems to have under the bill that was passed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  last year, this past year. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=390.72s)]
*  In terms of public interest and public pressure and how the legislature might sort of assess [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  its own appetite for going back and trying to do this again, reopening this against the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=398.34s)]
*  kind of elite pressure that you were describing there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  I was recently in Atlanta for just to stop on my book tour. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=406.85999999999996s)]
*  I was talking about a totally different matter and this came up in conversation during the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=411.02s)]
*  event and there was kind of a roar from the audience where I was surprised that people [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=415.05999999999995s)]
*  felt very connected to this issue, seemed very worried about it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=422.97999999999996s)]
*  I was asked about it a number of times when I was in Georgia. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=425.17999999999995s)]
*  Now that may be a self-selecting sample of people who've heard me talk about it on television, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=427.9s)]
*  but is it your sense that this is something that the press is following, that the public [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=432.46s)]
*  is following, that people know about the potential seriousness of what this could mean if this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=435.98s)]
*  was allowed to go into effect given what the legislature would have to do to get there? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=443.44s)]
*  Well, and Republican leaders, particularly in the state Senate, really I think overplayed [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=448.66s)]
*  their hand because within a couple of days after the effective date of the law, they [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=453.94s)]
*  filed this pretty, pretty venal complaint against the district attorney Fannie Willis [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=459.29999999999995s)]
*  to try to get the commission to remove her from office. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=466.41999999999996s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think it did themselves and the law a real damage in terms of credibility [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=469.7s)]
*  because the complaint they filed was quite obviously political. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=475.38s)]
*  It didn't have much merit to it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=480.46s)]
*  So I think that was an immediate signal to people that in fact the bill could be abused. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=482.74s)]
*  And that's what the Prosecuting Attorneys Association here in Georgia had been warning [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=487.54s)]
*  about that it could be misused for political purposes. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=491.90000000000003s)]
*  And sure enough, within a couple of days, the Republicans in the state Senate, the majority [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=494.82000000000005s)]
*  leader, I guess, proved them to be right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  Professor Clark Cunningham, law professor at Georgia State University, expert in legal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=506.70000000000005s)]
*  ethics and constitutional law. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  I know that we bug you about this, this bill, this law, this commission all the time to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=512.64s)]
*  help us stay abreast on it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=519.36s)]
*  We really appreciate your help. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=521.16s)]
*  Well, I compliment you guys for staying on top of this issue. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=522.16s)]
*  It's an important one. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=525.04s)]
*  Well, I think it's important too. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=526.4s)]
*  And I realize that it's not exactly a huge media scrum that's following this issue, but [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=528.52s)]
*  I think this is an absolutely crucial ethical issue. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=533.04s)]
*  And you've helped us more than anybody in understanding it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=536.5s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=538.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=539.7s)]
*  Thank you for having me here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=540.7s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=541.7s)]
*  Again, this situation in Georgia, you know, one of the things that's being adjudicated [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SPx_OdWt28&t=542.7s)]
