# Trump failure to consolidate Republican vote hints at 'ceiling' for general election | Super Tuesday
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY)
*  And then, overall, just overall, when I look at the exit polls, and particularly it was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=0.0s)]
*  in California, Virginia, North Carolina, around 35, 36 percent of Republicans, people [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=4.88s)]
*  voting in the Republican primary, saying they're not willing to guarantee that they will support [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=12.32s)]
*  the Republican nominee. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=17.52s)]
*  You know, that tells me Trump still has a problem consolidating his support. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=18.52s)]
*  And it's interesting, because, you know, the — let's assume the New York Times poll [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=22.96s)]
*  from the other day was correct. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=26.42s)]
*  That said, that Trump was getting 93 percent of the vote that he had in 2020, yet still [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=27.98s)]
*  people voting — you know, somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of people voting in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=32.54s)]
*  Republican primary are not voting for him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=36.22s)]
*  So who are those people? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=39.14s)]
*  You know, maybe they're independents, but they're people that are open to voting for Joe Biden. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=40.14s)]
*  So I feel I'm coming out of this sort of primary season feeling more optimistic about Biden's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  room to grow and Trump hitting some kind of ceiling. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=51.46s)]
*  Jen, I have to give you the opportunity to say California Senator Alex Padilla, because [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  Kevin DeLeon ran for it but didn't get it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  Oh my gosh, thank you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=63.58s)]
*  Thank you so much, Senator Alex Padilla. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=64.58s)]
*  Yes, I knew you would want to say that, and I wanted to give you a chance before we got [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=66.54s)]
*  too far down the road. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=69.9s)]
*  Oh, that's so nice of you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=70.9s)]
*  Claire, let me ask you about — I mean, the points that Jen was just making there in terms [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=71.9s)]
*  of the overall strength of the general election candidates in the presidential tonight and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=75.42s)]
*  what we're learning about that from these primaries. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=79.7s)]
*  Hey, listen, I think the thing I take away from today is looking at the margins and deciding [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=81.74s)]
*  which party is really more united. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=87.18s)]
*  And all the states that voted today, if you look at the results that we know right now, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=89.86s)]
*  there was only two states where Biden won by less than 70 points. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=94.82s)]
*  OK? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  Everything else, 80 percent, 82 percent. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=104.06s)]
*  You know how many states Donald Trump won by more than 70 points? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=106.82s)]
*  One, Alabama. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=111.94s)]
*  So there are more people voting against Donald Trump than are even thinking about voting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=114.66s)]
*  against Joe Biden. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=120.5s)]
*  And I get the uncommitted is sending a message, and I think it's one that needs to be heard. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=121.58s)]
*  I think it's important for our party. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  But really, there is a Republican war going on behind the scenes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=127.78s)]
*  It's playing out in primaries all over the country tonight, where big money is going [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=132.26s)]
*  in against MAGA candidates. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=136.58s)]
*  They have a problem in the Republican Party in terms of how unified they are. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=139.42s)]
*  I don't think we have near as far to go. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=142.98s)]
*  Well, Claire, let me let me just ask you to engage with something that's been happening [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  here on set tonight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=148.85999999999999s)]
*  We've had some hot, hot criticism of Nikki Haley staying in the race from my beloved [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  friend Alex Wagner, who's sitting here with me, saying highlighting the fact that Haley's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=154.7s)]
*  endgame is if she thinks she's going to win, that's not going to happen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  If she thinks she's doing any damage to Donald Trump, there's no evidence of that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=164.06s)]
*  That she continues to talk smack about Joe Biden in a way that potentially suppresses [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=169.3s)]
*  enthusiasm for Biden or possibly sort of serves as a sort of heat sink for Democrats who might [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=174.62s)]
*  otherwise put themselves in Biden's camp, but can put themselves sort of uselessly in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  Haley's camp as long as she's still in the race. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=187.94000000000003s)]
*  So listen, she's my beloved Alex Wagner, too. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=188.94000000000003s)]
*  But let me just say, I don't think it really matters. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  I think it matters for Nikki Haley's future. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=195.5s)]
*  What does she want to do? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  Does she want to make a bunch of money like Stephanie was talking about, giving speeches [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  and being on corporate boards? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=203.05999999999997s)]
*  Does she see some way forward in this Republican Party? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=205.14s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  She's done in this Republican Party. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  It's over. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=210.5s)]
*  She makes Mike Pence look popular in this Republican Party. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=211.5s)]
*  So I don't think Haley has a future in this Republican Party. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=215.42s)]
*  And I don't think her talking trash about Biden necessarily hurts Biden. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=219.76s)]
*  I think she's going to look silly if she comes out and endorses Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=225.94s)]
*  She's going to look pretty phony. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=229.82s)]
*  Not good for her political legacy if she comes out after saying the things she said and endorses [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=231.78s)]
*  him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=237.82s)]
*  Jen, what do you think along those same lines? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=238.82s)]
*  I think it doesn't. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=240.46s)]
*  I mean, I think she's helpful. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=241.46s)]
*  You know, it's just I think it's very helpful for voters, independents, Republicans, Democrats [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=242.46s)]
*  to hear a Republican make criticisms of Donald Trump. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=246.86s)]
*  And even though she also says bad things about Biden, I think it's worth it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  I think that that is a that's a valuable thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=253.66s)]
*  And if she endorses Trump in the end, she's just going to look as it's going to be. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  She's going to look like she has no integrity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=260.38s)]
*  I don't really think that's going to hurt Biden. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=261.82s)]
*  What we need are effective arguments against Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  And she's making those. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=267.02s)]
*  She's making those from somebody from the perspective from a perspective that people [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=268.5s)]
*  think is a credible Republican perspective in lots of ways. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=273.06s)]
*  And you can't manufacture that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=276.5s)]
*  That has to come from an authentic Republican place. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=277.76s)]
*  Jen Palmieri and Claire McCaskill, our dear friends. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=281.26s)]
*  Great to have you with us tonight. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=283.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N8qQA9WDBY&t=284.82s)]
