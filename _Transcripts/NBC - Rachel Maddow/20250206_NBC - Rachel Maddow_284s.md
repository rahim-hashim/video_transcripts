# Judge drops hammer on the Trump-Musk Treasury takeover gambit
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo)
*  You know what else got blocked today? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump and Musk gambit that turned out these thousands of people at the Treasury [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=2.22s)]
*  building this week to protest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The news that Trump had let his top campaign donor inexplicably access the payment system [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  at the U.S. Treasury that sends out everything from your Social Security check to your tax [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=16.86s)]
*  refund to everything else the government pays for, that news in particular had caused pretty [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=20.96s)]
*  understandable and pretty widespread freak out in this country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=27.26s)]
*  First, among Treasury employees, including the acting Treasury secretary, somebody who's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=31.98s)]
*  been employed at the Treasury Department for decades, who's a career, nonpartisan civil [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=38.1s)]
*  servant. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  He tried to stop them from getting their hands on this payment system, and then he resigned [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  when he couldn't stop them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=48.22s)]
*  But it caused a big freak out inside Treasury. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=49.78s)]
*  It also caused a significant freak out among members of Congress. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=52.8s)]
*  It also caused a significant freak out among members of the public. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=56.52s)]
*  We know that in part because members of Congress have been telling the press this week that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=60.36s)]
*  as the numbers of phone calls to House and Senate offices have skyrocketed over this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=64.04s)]
*  past two weeks with people complaining about Trump's actions and demanding that their [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=68.98s)]
*  members of Congress and their senators stand up and do whatever they can to stop Trump, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=73.76s)]
*  a significant proportion of the calls they've been getting, according to members of Congress, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=79.0s)]
*  calls from regular Americans specifically about this thing at Treasury, about the payment [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=84.16s)]
*  system at Treasury being handed over to Elon Musk's little unsupervised playgroup. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=90.28s)]
*  And this was made worse, frankly, when Trump's newly confirmed Treasury secretary, Scott [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  Besant, assured everybody repeatedly that the access that he had allowed Elon Musk and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  his team to this particularly sensitive payment system at the Treasury, he assured everybody [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=110.72s)]
*  that their access to the system was read-only, meaning that they weren't even trying to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=116.44s)]
*  use their access to the system to cut off any payments of any kind. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=121.9s)]
*  They'd never even had that in mind. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=126.0s)]
*  Well, despite those assurances from Scott Besant, reporting in The Washington Post and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=129.0s)]
*  in The New York Times and in the Associated Press and elsewhere would now seem to indicate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=135.28s)]
*  that Scott Besant was either lying or wrong when he gave everybody those assurances that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  their access was, quote, read-only. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  In fact, according to this recent reporting, from the very outset, from their very first [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=149.24s)]
*  demands to get access to that incredibly sensitive system that partisan actors have never before [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=153.8s)]
*  had access to, Elon Musk's people made clear that the reason they wanted access to that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  system was specifically because they intended to use it to stop funds from going out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=165.04s)]
*  On their own say so. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=172.4s)]
*  Funds they thought shouldn't go. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=173.98s)]
*  So we're starting to get a sense, two and a half weeks into this new Trump term, about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=178.76s)]
*  the fact that pushback definitely works, but the different forms that pushback can take. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  So, like in this case, with the Treasury payment system, we get direct action. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=192.28s)]
*  We get a big, impressive, basically impromptu protest organized on very short notice at [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=198.44s)]
*  the Treasury. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=204.72s)]
*  We get Treasury officials doing what they can to stop what they're trying to do and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=206.64s)]
*  then sounding the alarm about why they resigned when they weren't able to stop it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=212.84s)]
*  We get regular Americans calling their members of Congress and blowing their stacks about this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=218.48s)]
*  We then get Democratic members of Congress blowing their stacks and going to the protest [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=223.44s)]
*  and calling press conferences and demanding answers from the administration. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=228.32s)]
*  We get the press blowing up, the press doing reporting and blowing up this calm down, calm [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=231.9s)]
*  down, nothing to see here, apparent set of lies from the administration about what, in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=238.48s)]
*  fact, they have been up to with this scheme at Treasury. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=243.6s)]
*  All these different forms of pushback. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=247.56s)]
*  And now, hello, as of today, we get a federal judge throwing down a court order and blocking [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=250.52s)]
*  them from doing anything inside the Treasury payment system. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=255.8s)]
*  Pushback works. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=262.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGq9IWLMNdo&t=277.44s)]
