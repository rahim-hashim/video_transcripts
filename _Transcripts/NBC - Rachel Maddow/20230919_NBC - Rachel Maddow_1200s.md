# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Sept. 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs)
*  That dynamic that I'm describing at work in the news today, that indication that, you know, well, for all our faults, we must be doing something right. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=0.0s)]
*  If even the people who other countries spring from our prisons through diplomatic negotiations nevertheless want to stay here after they are sprung. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=8.0s)]
*  I feel like that dynamic is. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=17.0s)]
*  It's also a reminder that what we do have in this country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=21.0s)]
*  Is unique. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=26.0s)]
*  And it's not inevitable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=29.0s)]
*  What sets us apart as a country is loseable. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=31.0s)]
*  It's fragile. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=34.0s)]
*  It needs protecting. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=35.0s)]
*  And you can see that in the other headlines. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=38.0s)]
*  In today's news headline threats mount against prosecutors and FBI agents working on Hunter Biden probe prosecutors and FBI agents involved in the Hunter Biden investigation have been the targets of threats and harassment, according to government officials and congressional testimony obtained by NBC News. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=42.0s)]
*  Quote. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=59.0s)]
*  It's part of a dramatic uptick in threats against FBI agents that has coincided with the tax on the FBI and the Justice Department by congressional Republicans and former President Donald Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=60.0s)]
*  The threats have prompted the FBI to create a standalone unit to investigate and mitigate mitigate them, according to previously unreleased congressional testimony. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=70.0s)]
*  There's another one headline FBI investigating violent threats against officials in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=81.0s)]
*  In the saga of the the multiple criminal trials that are ahead for former President and Republican leading congressional presidential candidate Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=89.0s)]
*  One major thing we're waiting on for we're waiting on right now could happen at any time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=98.0s)]
*  Is news on whether the federal judge overseeing Trump's case in D.C. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=104.0s)]
*  The one about him trying to overturn the election. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=108.0s)]
*  Will that judge grant the prosecutors request for an order that restricts the kinds of statements that Trump can make about that trial so as to not prejudice the jury pool so as not to intimidate witnesses. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=111.0s)]
*  It's very striking. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=125.0s)]
*  We're waiting on that order for the judge right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=126.0s)]
*  But you know in in in their request for that order from the judge prosecutors had to give examples to the court of some of the times that Trump's overheated public statements have led his followers to commit violence or to threaten violence on his behalf. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=128.0s)]
*  They included in their court filing the recent arrest of a Trump supporter in Texas who called the chambers of the federal judge who was overseeing that trial and threatened to kill the judge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=142.0s)]
*  Because Trump is on trial in her courtroom. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=153.0s)]
*  I mean all of these things the court filing about the potential gag order the threats to Fulton County officials the threats to the FBI itself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=157.0s)]
*  I mean these are all just in the past few days. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=165.0s)]
*  But but but but these headlines are just now the ambient mood of public service in in the Trump era of Republican politics. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=168.0s)]
*  Right. It's it's Fulton County officials being threatened. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=177.0s)]
*  It's the Fulton County Sheriff having to investigate that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=179.0s)]
*  Then it's the Fulton County Sheriff being threatened and the F.B.I. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=187.0s)]
*  Having to investigate that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=190.0s)]
*  Then it's the FBI being threatened FBI officials and FBI agents themselves being threatened and the F.B.I. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=192.0s)]
*  Having to investigate that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=196.0s)]
*  It's the judge in one of the Trump cases being threatened. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=200.0s)]
*  It's the grand jurors in one of the Trump cases being threatened. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=205.0s)]
*  It's the prosecutor in one Trump case being threatened. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=208.6s)]
*  It's the prosecutor in another Trump case being threatened. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=211.4s)]
*  It's a federal prosecutor in the Hunter Biden investigation getting, quote, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=214.4s)]
*  such a barrage of credible threats that she had to seek security help from the U.S. Marshals Service. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=218.6s)]
*  It's public health workers being threatened and harassed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=224.8s)]
*  It's the head of the CDC getting death threats. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=228.4s)]
*  The head of the CDC. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=231.6s)]
*  It's the staff of the National Archives being threatened. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=234.6s)]
*  Sure, why not? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=238.2s)]
*  Quote, the National Archives has been hit with a wave of threats [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=239.2s)]
*  since the FBI retrieved classified records from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=243.2s)]
*  It's the IRS being threatened. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=247.2s)]
*  Quote, IRS launches safety review after right-wing threats. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=249.0s)]
*  Republicans in Congress repeating baseless claims long made by extremists, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=252.2s)]
*  experts say, potentially puts federal workers in danger. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=256.2s)]
*  It's more than a dozen people now federally criminally charged [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=260.4s)]
*  with making threats to election workers all over the country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=264.0s)]
*  Now it's Republican U.S. Senator, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=269.0s)]
*  telling his biographer about serving members of Congress in both the House and the Senate, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=273.4s)]
*  confiding in him that they have taken specific votes in Congress that benefited Trump, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=278.2s)]
*  specifically because they were afraid for their physical safety if they did not. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=285.0s)]
*  They would have voted in a way not beneficial to Trump, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=289.2s)]
*  but they felt physically threatened and so they voted in a way beneficial to Trump. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=292.8s)]
*  Quote, think of your personal safety. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=298.2s)]
*  Think of your children. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=300.2s)]
*  Why put your wife and children at risk? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  If public life, public service, even just regular citizen participation in regular politics [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=308.8s)]
*  is suffused with threats of violence now, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=315.6s)]
*  one of the things that for sure does is it forces regular people out of politics [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  and out of public service. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  Right? It is common sense. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  If politics and public service are being made into something that is quite literally dangerous, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  then in the normal course of events, normal people will steer clear. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  That's part of why we have a protected right to associate with others, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=341.6s)]
*  even for political purposes in this country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  Right? You ought to be able to gather with others. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  You ought to be able to assemble. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=351.6s)]
*  You have the right to assemble peaceably, to seek the redress of grievances. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=353.6s)]
*  Why do we have a right to peaceably assemble? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=358.6s)]
*  So that people can assemble peaceably, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=361.0s)]
*  so that you don't feel like trying to redress your grievances with the government [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  is something that's going to expose you to physical danger, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  either from the government or from anyone else. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=369.6s)]
*  We protect protesters. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=372.8s)]
*  We protect people assembling peaceably to say their piece, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  so that we can all peacefully say our piece, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=378.8s)]
*  so that we will, so our government will be accountable to us, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=382.6s)]
*  so our government will continue to adapt to the needs and the wants and the voice of the people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  What we have now is an atmosphere of ultra-right-wing political violence and threat. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  Which doesn't only affect the individual politicians and civil servants and poll workers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=399.4s)]
*  and law enforcement officials who are being directly targeted by Trump supporters. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=404.2s)]
*  It has a systemic effect too, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=409.0s)]
*  Systemically, over time, it thins out, it hollows out the public sphere and government. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=412.2s)]
*  So it's no longer for anybody. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=418.4s)]
*  It's only for the brave and the militant [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  and those who themselves are willing to either [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=424.4s)]
*  abide threats of violence or issue them themselves. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=426.9s)]
*  And that is not the kind of democracy we are. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=430.3s)]
*  That is not what we are supposed to be. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=433.2s)]
*  We are supposed to have a rollicking free press. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  We are supposed to have the constitutionally protected freedom to associate, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=440.4s)]
*  freedom to assemble, including for political reasons, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=445.4s)]
*  for redress of grievances from the government. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  We are supposed to have a vibrant, rollicking civil society. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=451.4s)]
*  We're supposed to have no barrier to entry, participatory democracy at every level. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  From student government to school board to city hall to your locally elected dog catcher [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  and alderman and state rep and president. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=466.4s)]
*  If participation in public life at every level instead is cowed by people wielding guns [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  and threats of mob violence and death threats and intimidation of witnesses [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=480.4s)]
*  and the doxing of grand jurors and all the rest of it, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  then at a fundamental level, we are just doing it wrong. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=487.2s)]
*  We are doing it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=490.2s)]
*  In fact, like way too much of the rest of the world does it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  And the fact that we haven't been that the fact that we have been different. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=496.9s)]
*  The fact that we have been a place where government is by and for the people [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=501.79999999999995s)]
*  is at least until now why so much of the world has been aspiring to come here when they can. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=508.0s)]
*  Last week, we saw Republicans in the state of Wisconsin [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=515.8s)]
*  fire the widely praised technocratic nonpartisan administrator of elections [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=519.9s)]
*  in that crucial swing state. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=525.7s)]
*  After she refused to help Wisconsin Republicans [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=527.7s)]
*  muddle or overturn the results of that state's presidential election in 2020. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=530.7s)]
*  Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature were told by the attorney general of the state. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=536.4s)]
*  They were told by their own lawyers in the legislature that they do not have the authority to fire this election official, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=540.0s)]
*  but they went ahead and they are trying to do it anyway. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=546.3s)]
*  This week, we'll see Republicans in the crucial swing state of North Carolina [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=551.8s)]
*  try to do effectively the same thing as North Carolina Republicans this week are teeing up a vote [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=556.1s)]
*  to take over elections administration in that state too. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=561.1s)]
*  They have been trying to do this in North Carolina, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=564.3s)]
*  but they have been blocked so far by voters in a clear state referendum. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=566.9s)]
*  Also, multiple court rulings are standing in their way too, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=572.5s)]
*  but this week they're apparently ready to go for it again. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  To take over the administration of elections in that swing state [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=579.6999999999999s)]
*  because heaven forbid we hold on to free and fair technocratically sound and boring election administration in this country. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=584.5999999999999s)]
*  Real small d democracy heaven forbid we hold on to that when instead we could trade it in for garbage untrusted elections [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=592.5s)]
*  like everybody else has in so many parts of the rest of the world, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=599.5s)]
*  which again is one of the things that sends good people of all those other countries in the world fleeing to us when they can. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=602.4s)]
*  Because for so long we've done it better because our Constitution has led us to do it better. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=611.0s)]
*  We have a good and rare thing going in this country. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=618.7s)]
*  A republic if we can keep it doesn't mean we don't have our problems. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=624.7s)]
*  We have a good system for fixing her problems. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=628.7s)]
*  We are listed as the in case of emergency contact in the phone of the whole rest of the world. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=632.1s)]
*  Which is something to be proud of and it is something to fight hard to protect. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=641.7s)]
*  Back with us now for the interview is Linda Thomas-Greenfield. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=648.1s)]
*  She is the US ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  This is the week of the United Nations General Assembly along with President Biden, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=652.4s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is going to be speaking with the UN General Assembly this week. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=657.4s)]
*  I think they're both speaking tomorrow. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=663.0s)]
*  I know the president is president speaking. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=665.1s)]
*  I also expect the president Biden, President Zelensky will meet and continue their talks in person on this trip. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=668.1s)]
*  I have to ask you about something that I realize is a thorny sort of thing, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=674.8s)]
*  which is that one of the things we've learned in the news in the past week or so is that as America is supporting Ukraine [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=679.0s)]
*  in its war to defend itself against Russia, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=687.0s)]
*  a single American citizen has business interests of such a type that he has been able as an individual to make decisions [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=691.9s)]
*  to constrain Ukraine's military from carrying out operations against Russia. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=702.7s)]
*  And I'm talking of course about Elon Musk. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=708.7s)]
*  It is, it's, I'm sure this is not an unprecedented thing in American history, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  but in Mr. Musk's case, we've got somebody who is an American businessman who effectively has foreign policy sway on his own [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  and who for whatever reason has effectively decided to conduct competing and I would say oppositional foreign policy to the United States, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=725.0s)]
*  a country of which he is a citizen. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=734.3s)]
*  Who does President Zelensky come to to complain about that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=736.9s)]
*  I mean, you are the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=739.6s)]
*  but Mr. Musk appears to be competing with his own country in terms of what his foreign policy is, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  and he has the technological resources to do it in a materially significant way. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, I would assume that President Zelensky will raise that with the United States [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=753.9s)]
*  and having served as an ambassador overseas and served here, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=760.4s)]
*  I do have countries come to me to complain sometimes about the actions of an American company in their country [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=764.8s)]
*  and we do try to address those issues when they're brought to our attention. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=777.1s)]
*  So I assume if President Zelensky has a complaint, he will bring that to us. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=782.0s)]
*  If he hasn't already, he hasn't brought it to me. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=788.1s)]
*  With the kind of technology that we're talking about here, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=791.7s)]
*  this Starlink technology linked to Mr. Musk's SpaceX company is an integral, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=794.1s)]
*  effectively information supply line for Ukrainian military forces, an irreplaceable asset for them. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=800.1s)]
*  And that's bad in one sense, we now know, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=806.5s)]
*  because the United States as a government effectively can't make a decision [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=809.6999999999999s)]
*  as to how that resource should be deployed to help or hurt our ally in that conflict. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=815.3s)]
*  It's instead being made by a business, which is purportedly an American business, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=820.3s)]
*  but not behaving in a way that is consistent with America's stated interests. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=823.5s)]
*  What are the responsibilities of the American government toward American businesses [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=827.4s)]
*  that are messing with American foreign policy? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=834.2s)]
*  You know, we do two things, working with American companies overseas. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=836.6s)]
*  We support American companies in their efforts to work overseas, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=840.5s)]
*  but we also establish certain parameters for how American companies operate. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  This is a situation that I can't comment on specifically. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=852.6s)]
*  I don't know any of the details of this, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=856.7s)]
*  but I do expect that President Zelensky will raise it, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=859.9s)]
*  and it will be brought to the attention of others to address. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=864.6999999999999s)]
*  I knew you were going to avoid answering me on that question. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  I knew I could tell you before I asked it, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  because I know that you can't answer it in the specific, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=879.0999999999999s)]
*  but I find it to be a confounding situation just as an observer and as an American. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=881.5s)]
*  Another situation that is confounding and concerning [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=887.8s)]
*  is one that the Biden administration has expressed very sharp concern about, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  which is a new law in Uganda which is being called the Kill the Gays Law, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  which establishes, in fact, the death penalty for something they call aggravated homosexuality. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=899.3s)]
*  They've already started to arrest people under this law. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=904.5s)]
*  They're threatening to kill people just for being gay. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=907.0999999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration has been very sharply critical of this. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=908.9s)]
*  The Obama administration was very sharply critical of this in 2013 and 2014 [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=913.7s)]
*  when the Ugandan government tried it the first time around. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=917.9000000000001s)]
*  But there are a couple ways in which U.S. fingerprints are actually on this horrific policy. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=922.0s)]
*  One is that American right-wing evangelical activists have encouraged the Ugandan government to do this. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=925.9000000000001s)]
*  The other is that U.S. funds make up a significant portion of the Ugandan government's operating expenses, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=932.4000000000001s)]
*  specifically the massive assistance we give them through the PEPFAR program [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=938.4000000000001s)]
*  to contradict the effects of HIV and AIDS in that country. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=942.1s)]
*  PEPFAR is, of course, a very successful program. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=945.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think all sort of righteous people want to defend it in terms of how many lives it's saved around the world. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=949.3000000000001s)]
*  But I keep hearing... [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=955.3000000000001s)]
*  25 million. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=956.6s)]
*  20 million. I mean, it's an astonishingly effective American program, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=957.3000000000001s)]
*  perhaps one of the most life-saving American interventions in the world ever. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=960.6s)]
*  And I keep hearing from activists who are trying to keep the gay community from being killed off by their government in Uganda [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=965.3s)]
*  that PEPFAR funds are specifically being routed through the Ugandan government [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=973.8s)]
*  in a way that empowers and rewards the ministries and the individual ministers [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=978.3s)]
*  who are most responsible in Uganda for that policy. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=983.3s)]
*  And given how strongly the administration feels about this, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=986.8s)]
*  isn't there a way that that funding could be directed so that it's still solving the problem in Uganda, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=991.3s)]
*  but it is not making the problem worse for that sexual minority that is facing really, really serious, serious risk? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=997.8s)]
*  You know, I was asked this question by Lawrence O'Donnell when I was on his show the last time after you spoke to him. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1005.3s)]
*  And let me just start out by saying that this law is horrific. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1012.3s)]
*  And we've made very clear in no uncertain terms to the Ugandan government that it is unacceptable. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1016.3s)]
*  And we are doing everything in our power to support the LGBTQ community in Uganda to ensure their safety [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1023.3s)]
*  and to ensure that they are not damaged by this law. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1033.3s)]
*  And we do know that at least one individual has recently been arrested and charged and is in the process of being tried. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1042.3s)]
*  And because it's a capital offense, it's being held in prison awaiting trial. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1052.3s)]
*  It is a capital offense. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1056.3s)]
*  Life-threatening situations. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1057.3s)]
*  So we are looking at, and I said this before, how we can continue to provide the good support [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1058.3s)]
*  that PEPFAR provides directly to individuals to help save their lives without putting that funding through the Ugandan government [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1069.3s)]
*  or through individuals in the Ugandan government who are responsible for implementing this law. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1078.3s)]
*  It's a huge dilemma, but we have to find a way to do that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1086.3s)]
*  And we have to find a way to hold those accountable who are basically violating the human rights of the LGBTQ community in Uganda. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1091.3s)]
*  We engage with them on a regular basis. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1102.3s)]
*  I was involved with the situation during the 2013-2014 period during the Obama administration when I was Assistant Secretary for Africa. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1104.3s)]
*  And we were successful in getting the government to stop moving forward on the law. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1115.3s)]
*  We failed on that this time around. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1123.3s)]
*  But we're continuing to engage the LGBTQ community on how we can help them and also to put pressure on the Ugandan government [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1126.3s)]
*  to push back and urge them not to enforce this horrific law. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1136.3s)]
*  Neighboring countries, of course, watching closely to see what happens in Uganda, to see if they should also pursue legislation like this, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1142.3s)]
*  raising the stakes even further. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1148.3s)]
*  Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Madam Ambassador, our Ambassador to the United Nations, busiest woman in New York this week. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1150.3s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. It's an honor to have as much time with you. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1155.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1158.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYLnHSUSRs&t=1172.3s)]
