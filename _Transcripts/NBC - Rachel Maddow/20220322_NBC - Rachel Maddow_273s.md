# Ketanji Brown Jackson Unperturbed By Republican Insinuations At Confirmation Hearing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw)
*  Joining us now is Janee Nelson, president and director, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=0.0s)]
*  counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=3.36s)]
*  Ms. Nelson, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=7.28s)]
*  I'm puzzled by Senator Graham and Senator John Cornyn of Texas's line of questioning today, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=10.48s)]
*  which was asking Judge Jackson to offer her opinions [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=17.44s)]
*  about the treatment and the process that other black jurists went through. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=21.2s)]
*  What's the point of a line of questioning like that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  It was, it seemed to be the playbook for many of the Republican senators during the hearing, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=30.4s)]
*  and that was to air their grievances about either previous hearings or about other [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=35.68s)]
*  potential nominees that they perhaps would have supported more than they support [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=41.92s)]
*  the very eminently qualified Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=47.2s)]
*  Either way, it was an appalling display of disrespect to ask her to opine on the treatment [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=50.32s)]
*  of other black women in the process. In many ways, it was pitting black women against one [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=57.92s)]
*  another and asking her to offer her opinion about the treatment or the vetting process [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=63.52s)]
*  that she really had no responsibility for and that they wrongly characterized as an assault on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  these two individuals. However, it turned out in terms of whether they moved forward or didn't, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=76.72s)]
*  had nothing to do with the qualifications of Katanji Brown Jackson, which was the only subject [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=82.0s)]
*  relevant at today's hearing. What we saw was a very nasty exercise in trying to create and foment [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  discord among professional, highly qualified women, black women, who should not be maligned [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  in any way. It was very disappointing to see them try to play that tactic and certainly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  inappropriate for a hearing of this sort. Let me ask you about Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=110.4s)]
*  To ask her, ask Judge Jackson about a reference to Nicole Hannah Jones' piece of journalism called [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  the 1619 Project. He was holding up books from a Georgetown school on which she's a board, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  a private school on which she's a member of the board. He was sort of trying to pitter down on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  critical race theory. Tell me a little bit about what you observed in that exchange. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=137.84s)]
*  Yeah, it seems that he thought we would all be impressed by the theater of it all and the props [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=141.52s)]
*  that he brought in to try to link her to the 1619 Project and to be renowned, acclaimed, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  award-winning journalist and I should say LDF client, Nicole Hannah Jones. I think that Judge [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=156.8s)]
*  Jackson explained quite clearly why she referenced the 1619 Project because it is part of the zeitgeist [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=163.12s)]
*  around issues of race currently and she raised it in a speech to students who would clearly be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=171.92s)]
*  interested in it. We know that the 1619 Project is a very popular project and text because of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=178.0s)]
*  number one Times bestseller list that is occupied at the forefront for many weeks. So she mentioned [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=186.88s)]
*  it in a speech. She referenced the author or the actual organizer of the project, Nicole Hannah [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=193.28s)]
*  Jones. But that has nothing to do again with her qualifications as a judge. It has nothing to do [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=200.24s)]
*  with any of the decisions that she wrote or any of the judgments that she's issued or any of her [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=205.44s)]
*  professional work. Now it's not to say that it's off limits to question someone's speech or oratory [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=212.16s)]
*  or writings outside of their judicial background, but to ascribe a negative intention to it or to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=218.88s)]
*  ascribe a particular viewpoint to it was again beyond the pale and completely unjustified. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=226.24s)]
*  What we saw today was an attempt to assail the character of Katanji Brown Jackson because her [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=233.84s)]
*  record itself is so wholly unassailable. They're grasping at straws. They're trying to find some [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=241.52s)]
*  way to make her look less than qualified and they failed miserably. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=247.12s)]
*  So [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=255.68s)]
*  you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fwl3tKaGjw&t=272.48s)]
