# With Fraudulent Trump Financials Exposed, House Oversight Asks GSA To Yank Hotel Lease
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc)
*  Joining us now is Virginia Democratic Congressman Jerry Connolly, senior member of the House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee and one of the authors of that letter that was sent to the General Services Administration [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=4.8s)]
*  today regarding Trump's D.C. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=9.52s)]
*  Hotel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=11.28s)]
*  Congressman Connolly is also the chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=12.36s)]
*  Sir, thank you for being here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=15.72s)]
*  I know you are very busy with important things. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=17.6s)]
*  We very much appreciate your time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  My pleasure, Alex. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=22.56s)]
*  What's the timeline here? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=25.04s)]
*  I mean, when do you expect the GSA to respond to your concerns that Trump has likely violated [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=26.08s)]
*  his contract with the government? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=32.2s)]
*  Obviously, I would hope that they would expedite their review and would come to the same conclusion [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=34.6s)]
*  many of us have already, which is that on its face, the action by Missouri this week [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=40.04s)]
*  negates the validity of any financial information or disclosure Trump has provided to GSA in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=46.4s)]
*  justification for the lease he was granted six years ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=54.24s)]
*  That ought to happen right away. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  This could be fraught, and GSA should have nothing to do with it and ought to do the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=60.88s)]
*  right thing and pull the plug expeditiously. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=65.84s)]
*  I guess I wonder, I mean, this hotel project has been fraught from the beginning, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=68.76s)]
*  It's always been the locus of a lot of lawsuits and consternation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of the Deutsche Bank loan? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=79.92s)]
*  Deutsche Bank agreed to loan Trump $170 million for this hotel property, but it turns out [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=83.2s)]
*  they were only given access to two pages of his tax returns and they weren't allowed to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=89.28s)]
*  keep any copies of financial statements. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=94.52s)]
*  Do you have a theory about why Deutsche Bank would agree to lend him so much money under [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=97.0s)]
*  those conditions which seem extraordinary given the lack of information? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=102.12s)]
*  Deutsche Bank is a very prominent international financial institution, and yet it's always [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=108.4s)]
*  had a strange bromance with Donald Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=115.92s)]
*  It's cut corners, it's loaned when no one else would, it's taken very risky moves to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=120.4s)]
*  finance investments that nobody else would touch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  It has given him favorable treatment as it did in this circumstance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=130.8s)]
*  What bank in its right mind would loan anybody $170 million based on two pages of very thin [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=136.68s)]
*  gruel by way of financial disclosure? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=144.4s)]
*  I mean, that's just reckless behavior by a financial institution. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  So the nature of the relationship between the Trump organization, Donald Trump personally, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=151.08s)]
*  and Deutsche Bank is something that I think is highly questionable and worthy of examination [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=156.36s)]
*  by the DA, by the U.S. attorney, and by, frankly, the Department of Justice. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=164.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, speaking of strange bromances, there's also the group, the hotel group, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=170.88s)]
*  Miami-based CGI merchant group that's trying to buy this lease off of Trump for well over [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=176.68s)]
*  market value, somewhere to the tune of $75 million or $100 million over the market value [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=182.84s)]
*  of the Trump Hotel in D.C. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you know anything about this group and what kind of concerns do you have about GSA [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=190.88s)]
*  approving a sale of this property to an unknown investor that's willing to pay an inflated price? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=195.0s)]
*  I don't have any particulars on this group, CGI management, but again, it just smells. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=202.0s)]
*  Why would anyone pay a premium above any kind of reasonable market value for a lease on a hotel [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=212.24s)]
*  that's been losing money and Trump has been lying about it? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=220.64s)]
*  And that's before the bizarre decision to essentially renounce 10 years of financial disclosures. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  So what is going on here? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=230.0s)]
*  Why do you want to enrich Donald Trump at such a premium? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=232.16s)]
*  And that goes back to your other question about GSA and how quickly they ought to act. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=237.27999999999997s)]
*  No one's above the law. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  GSA should not be an enabler to enrich Donald Trump in clearly falsification of documents [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=244.8s)]
*  by way of financial information and falsification of valuation and falsification of income. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=253.12s)]
*  And he's engaged in all three. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  And that should not be rewarded by this potential investor in the lease and certainly not by GSA. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=261.72s)]
*  GSA can bring it all to a screaming halt and not see Trump rewarded for bad behavior [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=270.08s)]
*  by pulling the lease and pulling it now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think it's an understatement to say the federal government should not be involved [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  in a financial bromance with a former president. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=284.12s)]
*  Virginia Democratic Congressman Jerry Connolly, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=287.36s)]
*  Thank you, Alex. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=292.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMC6gKhlcc&t=300.08s)]
