# Julian Assange agrees to guilty plea in exchange for release, ending years-long standoff
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo)
*  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a territory of the United States, but it is very, very, very, very far from the mainland U.S. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=4.0s)]
*  I think we can show you on a map here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=11.0s)]
*  This is the United States. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=13.0s)]
*  You see over there on the right side of the map, that's the Pacific Coast side of the American mainland. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=15.0s)]
*  You see the state of Hawaii way out there in the Pacific Ocean. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=20.0s)]
*  And then way, way, way, way, way, way, way further out in the Pacific from Hawaii, you find the Northern Mariana Islands. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=23.0s)]
*  They are way out there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=29.0s)]
*  They are way closer to, say, Australia than they are to the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=30.0s)]
*  And that's important. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=36.0s)]
*  That proximity plays a crucial part in a big story that just broke this evening as we were getting on the air. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=37.0s)]
*  Because at 9 a.m. Wednesday morning, local time in the Northern Mariana Islands in a U.S. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=43.0s)]
*  federal courthouse in the capital of Saipan, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is expected to appear [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=49.0s)]
*  and to plead guilty to a single felony count of illegally obtaining and disclosing national security material. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=57.0s)]
*  And the really huge news here is that after he pleads guilty in that federal courthouse in the Northern Mariana Islands, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=64.0s)]
*  after he pleads guilty there, he will be allowed to fly home to his native Australia as a free man. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=71.0s)]
*  For the last five years, Julian Assange has been in prison in Britain. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=78.0s)]
*  He has been fighting attempts to extradite him to the United States to stand trial on more than a dozen charges [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=83.0s)]
*  that he illegally obtained and disseminated classified information on his WikiLeaks website. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=89.0s)]
*  Even once he and the United States Department of Justice reached an agreement under which he would plead guilty to one count, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=94.0s)]
*  essentially be sentenced to time served and released from prison in Britain, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=101.0s)]
*  there was still one last hangup that needed to be sorted out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=105.0s)]
*  Defendants, if they're going to plead guilty to a felony, they have to do it in person. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=108.0s)]
*  Julian Assange has always adamantly refused to set foot in the mainland United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=113.0s)]
*  And so that's where this compromise came from. The Northern Mariana Islands. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=119.0s)]
*  That is where he will enter his plea. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=124.0s)]
*  Julian Assange first made a name for himself, leaking volumes of classified information [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=127.0s)]
*  on America's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq through the site WikiLeaks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=133.0s)]
*  He then in 2016 published leaked material the Russian intelligence services had hacked from the Democratic Party. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=138.0s)]
*  Russian military intelligence stole the material. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=147.0s)]
*  Then they used WikiLeaks. They disseminated the material through WikiLeaks [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=151.0s)]
*  in a specific effort to hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign and help Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=156.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, you will remember, happily accepted the help. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=161.0s)]
*  He cited WikiLeaks nearly 150 times during the campaign. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=165.0s)]
*  At one point, just flat out crowing, I love WikiLeaks. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=169.0s)]
*  Three years later, when Trump's Justice Department indicted Julian Assange, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=173.0s)]
*  Trump claimed that he knew nothing about this organization. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=177.0s)]
*  The Biden administration is the third US administration to try to figure out what to do with Julian Assange. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=181.0s)]
*  The Obama Justice Department ultimately decided that the First Amendment issues were basically too thorny. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=187.0s)]
*  When the Trump Justice Department indicted Assange in 2019, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=194.0s)]
*  many people feared it would have a chilling effect on the ability of journalists to report on national security and classified information. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=197.0s)]
*  That said, lots of other people argued that what Julian Assange was doing was something other than journalism. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=205.0s)]
*  But when it came to the Biden administration, it seems they just wanted to figure out a way to put this case to bed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=211.0s)]
*  And they have figured something out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=217.0s)]
*  And so on Wednesday, in a very unlikely spot in the middle of the Pacific, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=219.0s)]
*  the long saga of Julian Assange versus the United States and the United States versus Julian Assange looks like it is set to come to an end. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=224.0s)]
*  At least that's what it looks like from here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=234.0s)]
*  But watch this space. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=237.0s)]
*  I'm Luke Russert. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JZCzhnSmo&t=241.0s)]
