# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks)
*  The Stormy Daniels pay to cover up the affair hush money case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the only one that's going to go to trial before the election. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Wasn't supposed to be the first one. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=9.6s)]
*  Remember what was going to be the first one? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  What was going to be the first one was a trial of Donald Trump for the big issue, right? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=14.08s)]
*  For him trying to throw out the results of the 2020 election [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=20.32s)]
*  so he could stay in power even though he lost. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=23.6s)]
*  The prosecutors asked the judge to start this trial two months ago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=26.16s)]
*  The first trial date they asked for was in early March 2024. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=33.04s)]
*  That was going to be first. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  What happened to that? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=38.32s)]
*  Well, when it emerged January 2021 that there was a recording of Trump live on the phone [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  demanding that Georgia officials falsify the election results and declare him the winner. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=47.2s)]
*  When everybody heard that tape, everybody over the age of zero in this country [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=51.36s)]
*  knew that there would have to be a criminal investigation of that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=55.2s)]
*  I mean, that very much sounded like the commission of a very obvious crime on tape. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  The district attorney in the county where the phone call took place [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=62.88s)]
*  then opened that criminal investigation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=66.72s)]
*  Of course she did. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  How could she not have? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=71.12s)]
*  But then what happened, right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=72.64s)]
*  They opened the floodgates on her. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  In a way that is underappreciated in this country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=79.2s)]
*  First thing they did, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=82.08s)]
*  Republicans in the state legislature decided that for the first time in the history of that state, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=82.96s)]
*  they needed to give themselves a new power. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  They needed to give themselves the power to remove prosecutors from their jobs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=89.52s)]
*  Even in the middle of a case. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=94.63999999999999s)]
*  Republicans in the Georgia state legislature never wanted that power before now [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=97.52s)]
*  in the whole history of the state. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=101.44s)]
*  But now that Trump's under investigation for a crime, now they want that new power. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=103.36s)]
*  This new law giving themselves that power, they passed it in such a rush, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  it suffered from what you might charitably call constitutional infirmities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=111.04s)]
*  They then had to pass it again. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=115.04s)]
*  So they did. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  And in so doing, they created a board with all Republican appointees. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=118.4s)]
*  It has a brand new power under the laws of the state of Georgia [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  to discipline and remove prosecutors in the middle of their cases. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=125.76s)]
*  A power they never had before, never wanted before. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=129.52s)]
*  Not before Fonny Willis brought a case against Donald Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=132.16s)]
*  But that was only the start. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=136.08s)]
*  Led by one of the Republicans who served as a fake elector in Georgia, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=137.28s)]
*  Republicans in that state then formed a Georgia Senate special committee on investigations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=141.68s)]
*  Oh, what investigations are they wanting to do? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=148.32s)]
*  They are specifically investigating Fonny Willis. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=151.12s)]
*  They formed a new committee just for that purpose. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=154.24s)]
*  The head of that new committee to investigate Fonny Willis [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=156.64s)]
*  went to the Georgia State Republican Convention this weekend [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=159.44s)]
*  to brag about how he's about to subpoena her. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=162.24s)]
*  To testify under oath and force her to hand over evidence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=164.48s)]
*  to the Republicans in the Georgia State Senate. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  They're characterizing it as a financial concern. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  But he's been very explicit that the financial concern he has [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=175.76s)]
*  is that she's expending financial resources on the Trump prosecution. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=179.04s)]
*  Republicans at the county level in Georgia are now saying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  they want to put her office through an audit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=189.28s)]
*  A Republican member of Congress from Georgia has filed an ethics complaint against her. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=197.36s)]
*  Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, has opened an investigation of her in Washington as well [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=200.88s)]
*  and has subpoenaed her and is now threatening to hold her in contempt of Congress, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=206.8s)]
*  threatening to put her in jail. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=210.56s)]
*  And now two Republican U.S. senators are jumping in as well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=213.52s)]
*  Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=216.96s)]
*  Just announcing a few days ago that they too are going to open a new investigation [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=220.08s)]
*  of this Georgia prosecutor, Fannie Willis. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=224.16s)]
*  This time opening this investigation in the United States Senate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  They have created a maelstrom of political harassment and pressure. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=230.0s)]
*  Bringing it down to bear on this one prosecutor like a laser. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=236.08s)]
*  Because she brought this case against someone of their party who has political power. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  This is Republicans using their political power to try to shut off the legal system, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  to try to shut off the rule of law here so it cannot be used against their guy, against Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=254.08s)]
*  Let's get real about this and take it seriously. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=260.24s)]
*  Because what's going on here is they are taking apart the judicial system. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=265.44s)]
*  They are fundamentally changing the judiciary in the state, in the entire state, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=269.12s)]
*  all to protect this one powerful defendant in their own party. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=276.24s)]
*  And she had the temerity to charge. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=280.08s)]
*  Fannie Willis is ably defending herself. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  She is good at this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=287.36s)]
*  And she knew what she was walking into. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=289.68s)]
*  But this story for all of us, this is not a profile in courage. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=292.08s)]
*  This is a profile in cowardice. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=298.0s)]
*  This is a profile in failure and neglect by us, by the people. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=300.32s)]
*  By the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=306.0s)]
*  Because the reason she is out there defending herself so ably [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=307.28s)]
*  is because nobody else is defending her. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  She's standing alone against all of this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=315.76s)]
*  The rule of law depends on the people who enforce it being able to enforce it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  Even when those who are implicated in a legal proceeding are powerful people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=324.32s)]
*  These are human beings. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=328.0s)]
*  They are not magic. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  They are not bulletproof. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=330.64s)]
*  They are not superhuman. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=332.08s)]
*  And right now, they have no one defending them as they are being asked [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=334.0s)]
*  to bear superhuman pressure and threat. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=338.56s)]
*  And I get it that there is a sort of good faith instinct against defending these folks, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=343.12s)]
*  For Americans who believe in the independence and professionalism of the judiciary, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=351.92s)]
*  why step up politically and defend a judge or a prosecutor? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=356.88s)]
*  That's supposed to be a non-political part of our system, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. True. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=362.48s)]
*  But here, in reality, in this era of this Republican Party, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=363.68s)]
*  there is a ton of inappropriate political pressure, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=368.72s)]
*  improper, craven, pretextual, dishonest intimidation being brought to bear on prosecutors [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=372.24s)]
*  and on judges from the right, from the allies of the former president. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  And it is working. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=382.0s)]
*  And there has been no significant countervailing pressure defending them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=384.56s)]
*  If you go after a judge's family, if you demonize a prosecutor, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=389.44s)]
*  and bring bogus allegations and charges against them, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=393.12s)]
*  it is you who are breaking the American legal system. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=395.92s)]
*  And you ought to be the one who pays for that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Thus far, what's the price been? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=403.04s)]
*  Other than getting heckled by fed-up New Yorkers on the sidewalks sometimes, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=405.44s)]
*  the Republicans who are waging war on the legal system, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=410.32s)]
*  proclaiming the illegitimacy of the legal system on behalf of Donald Trump, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=414.56s)]
*  up until now, they are paying no cost for it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=419.12s)]
*  The rule of law in this country, in practical terms, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=421.84s)]
*  is made up of people doing hard jobs who themselves can break when they are attacked. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  And right now, you and I, all of us, we are making history in this country. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=429.84s)]
*  And the history that we are making is that there is no one defending Fannie Willis but herself. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  And in the noble alternate version of this history, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=441.67999999999995s)]
*  that we'd like to imagine we would be part of, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  the whole country would be up in arms about Georgia and about New York, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=448.16s)]
*  and about all of these cases, telling these people to back off the judges, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=451.44s)]
*  back off the witnesses and the jurors, back off the prosecutors, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=455.12s)]
*  back off Fannie Willis, protect these cases, protect the rule of law. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=458.56s)]
*  We imagine that's who we are as a country, but we are not showing it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=465.04s)]
*  We are not standing up to defend these people. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=468.88s)]
*  At least, not yet. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  Let me start by asking you about what your life has been like and how things have changed [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=474.24s)]
*  over the course of this past year. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=485.36s)]
*  I know you have bodyguards. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=487.36s)]
*  I know you had to leave your home because of ongoing threats against you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=489.68s)]
*  I saw footage last week in an event honoring the South Fulton police. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=494.64s)]
*  You got a little bit emotional thanking the police for having kept you safe in what has been a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  remarkably threatening environment for you. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=502.72s)]
*  I wondered what effect the constant threat of violence that you've been living with has had [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  on you and on your ability to do your work? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=514.0s)]
*  Thank you for asking. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=519.36s)]
*  Not many people ask about what is the personal journey that's been going on. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=520.08s)]
*  It really hasn't been happening in the last year. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  It's been happening since about a month after I took office. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=527.76s)]
*  From the time I took office, I began to get threats. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=531.28s)]
*  Those threats come in the way of emails. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=534.4799999999999s)]
*  Those threats come in the way of phone calls, text messages, any which way you can imagine. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=536.7199999999999s)]
*  At some point, the threats became where I had to leave my home. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=544.0s)]
*  I've been out of my home since the first year in office. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=547.52s)]
*  They've come from a variety of sources. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=550.7199999999999s)]
*  One of the first things that ever happened was there was a protest at my house at [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=553.8399999999999s)]
*  five o'clock in the morning. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  People mad because the last administration had left police cases, lots of them, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=560.0s)]
*  and they wanted immediate action on them. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  That was the first thing that happened. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  The threats have certainly been about lots of different kinds of cases that I've prosecuted. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=568.72s)]
*  People are very unhappy with them because of some recent cases that most of them are racial in [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=572.96s)]
*  nature. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  It has cost me to leave my home financially. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=579.5200000000001s)]
*  I'm paying for my mortgage because I refuse to give up the home where I raised my children, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=581.84s)]
*  but also paying for another establishment. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=586.32s)]
*  I have 24-hour protection around me. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  It's a very interesting way to live, but it's well worth it to have the honor of being the first [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=594.6400000000001s)]
*  female district attorney in Fulton County. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=601.6s)]
*  It pales in comparison to what my victims are going through. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=603.7600000000001s)]
*  The reality is one of the reasons we are upsetting people is we are so successful here in Fulton [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  County. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  I have the third largest crime drop in America. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=613.2s)]
*  We have it because we are taking a balanced approach, both unapologetically going after gangs [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=616.16s)]
*  and violent criminals and anyone who should violate the law in my county, but we are also doing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=621.52s)]
*  programs. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=626.0799999999999s)]
*  It has been a huge sacrifice, but it's well worth it for my community. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  We spoke, you did an interview with me earlier in your tenure, and we talked about what it was like [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  to become a national lightning rod and to attract not just all the attention that a district attorney [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=642.16s)]
*  in a big place like Fulton County is always going to get locally for all of the important issues [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=648.16s)]
*  that affect the people of Fulton County, but to become a household name around the country, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=651.76s)]
*  including by people who decided they were going to make your life hell for having brought one [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=656.56s)]
*  particularly very high-profile case. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=661.04s)]
*  Do you feel like you've changed over the course of this term in office, over the course of this [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  four years in terms of having to develop new skills, new resources, develop a thicker skin than you [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=669.6s)]
*  might not have expected when you ascended to office January 1, 2020? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  This job has certainly made me closer to God because you have to go into prayer often. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  That's just the truth. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=690.88s)]
*  That's a positive, right, when you're getting closer to God. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=692.0s)]
*  But I can't explain to you how much I love the work that I do. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  I can't explain to you how loved I feel by my community. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=698.88s)]
*  You really should feel sorry for those that are trying to deter me from my work. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=702.88s)]
*  It doesn't do anything but motivate me to continue to work and to work hard. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=706.7199999999999s)]
*  And so I'm not someone that's going to be broken, but certainly it has caused me to get thicker skin [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=711.3599999999999s)]
*  or to be more resilient, to dig deeper, to work harder. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=716.7199999999999s)]
*  But what it has not done is deter me from my work. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=720.64s)]
*  Let me ask you about an interesting development that happened with a former [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  Democratic governor of Georgia, Governor Roy Barnes. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=727.92s)]
*  It emerged over the course of the Trump case and some of the, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  forgive me, the mischigas around that, that you had asked Governor Barnes if he would consider [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  joining the prosecution, special counsel, in that case. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=743.12s)]
*  And it emerged that he said no, saying, quote, I wasn't going to live with bodyguards for the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=746.7199999999999s)]
*  rest of my life, which is a commentary on what it takes to be part of a legal system in this era, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=751.5999999999999s)]
*  taking on politically powerful people. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=756.64s)]
*  But Governor Barnes, as far as I understand it, has since offered that if the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=759.6s)]
*  Republican-controlled legislature in Georgia comes after you with this new investigative committee [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=764.16s)]
*  that they seem to have formed specifically to come after you, with some of the other ways that they [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=769.76s)]
*  seem to be targeting you, that if you need legal representation of a specialty form as part of the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=774.56s)]
*  way they're coming after you through the legislature, that he will represent you in those matters. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=780.96s)]
*  I just wanted to ask if that's your understanding and what you make of those interactions that [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=785.2s)]
*  you've had with former Governor Barnes. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=790.16s)]
*  No, Governor Barnes is my attorney. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  They have decided in Georgia that they would like to come over after me. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=795.76s)]
*  They use false reasons for wanting to come after me. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=800.24s)]
*  I don't know if you remember, and I believe we talked about it last time, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=804.24s)]
*  Georgia had never had a prosecutorial oversight committee, and all of a sudden 14 minorities were [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=808.0s)]
*  elected to office to serve as district attorney. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they need an oversight committee to look after district attorneys because [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=817.84s)]
*  they want to tell us how to prosecute and who to prosecute and where we should put our resources. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=824.0s)]
*  As opposed to allowing the voters that put us in these seats to make those determinations, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=829.9200000000001s)]
*  the voters in my community are very clear that they want crime out of their communities, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=836.48s)]
*  but they want it done both by removing violent offenders, which is what we have done. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=843.76s)]
*  We've gone after gangs and we've worked with our police departments to do so, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=848.24s)]
*  but they also want second chances for low-level offenders, and we have done those programs. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=851.92s)]
*  What is so ironic is although it's only 14 of the 50 DAs in the state of Georgia, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=858.24s)]
*  most of the citizens report to our jurisdictions. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=864.8s)]
*  Although we're smaller in number than the other 36, most of the population has elected [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=868.24s)]
*  these minority DAs to serve them and has trusted their judgment, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=873.76s)]
*  but apparently we now need daddy to tell us how to do our job. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  The man has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly threatening [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=883.36s)]
*  Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  of Georgia says the man railed against D.A. Willis's prosecution of former President Donald Trump [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=892.0s)]
*  in YouTube live streams. At one point he's accused of saying D.A. Willis will quote, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=897.84s)]
*  be killed like a dog. He's said to be formally arraigned in Atlanta next month. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=903.04s)]
*  California man indicted earlier this month is the second person to face federal criminal charges [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=908.64s)]
*  for threatening to kill Fulton County DA Fannie Willis. The first was a man from Alabama. Together [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=913.52s)]
*  they represent a small fraction of the threats that Fannie Willis has received in the nine months [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=919.52s)]
*  since she began prosecuting Donald Trump and in the couple of years since she first started [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=924.24s)]
*  investigating that matter. She travels with bodyguards. She's been forced to leave her home. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=928.16s)]
*  All this while former President Trump continues to attack her relentlessly to his supporters. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=932.48s)]
*  And as Republicans at the county, state, and federal level do everything they can to undermine [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=938.16s)]
*  and impugn and stymie her work and smear her personally. This level of sustained public attack [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=944.16s)]
*  is not usually the price of entry for doing your job as a district attorney, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=950.32s)]
*  nor should it be in a country where the rule of law is supposedly the rule. The ability of prosecutors [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=954.4000000000001s)]
*  and judges to do their jobs without fear is a fundamental test of our democracy. Whether you [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=961.12s)]
*  like the Georgia criminal case against former President Trump or not, Fannie Willis is one of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=966.96s)]
*  the bellwethers for the rule of law in this country. Back with us now is the Fulton County [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=971.36s)]
*  District Attorney, Ms. Willis. Ms. Willis, I was interested to see in the Atlanta Journal [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=976.4s)]
*  Constitution today there were three Democratic state senators who published an opinion piece [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=981.76s)]
*  saying, quote, we are witnessing a concerted effort by Trump and MAGA Republican politicians [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=987.1999999999999s)]
*  to cast doubt on the legitimate and strong Fulton County election interference case [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=992.48s)]
*  by attacking the prosecutor. It's an effort that takes advantage of every avenue of government [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  power to which Trump's allies have access. Their goal, delay accountability for Trump's alleged [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1001.68s)]
*  attempt to illegally overturn a presidential election. This strikes me very close to my heart [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  because I feel like this is one of the first times I've seen people standing up for you on this point. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1015.04s)]
*  I wanted to ask how it strikes you. Do you agree with their assessment of what's going on? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1020.2399999999999s)]
*  Well, as you know, let's start with the federal government and Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan has time [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1024.32s)]
*  after time after time attacked my office with no legitimate purpose. Anyone who knows Jim [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1035.36s)]
*  Jordan's history knows that he only has the purpose of trying to interfere in a criminal [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1041.52s)]
*  investigation. He has now turned his tricks to he's going to look at grant programs, which I invite [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW33xBAE7Ks&t=1047.04s)]
