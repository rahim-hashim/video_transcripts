# Poland, No Stranger To Russian Aggression, Takes Leadership Role In Helping Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA)
*  Let me sketch out a situation for you and ask you if it sounds familiar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia begins amassing troops on another country's borders. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The United States calls out Russia's belligerent moves and warns it not to invade. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=8.48s)]
*  Everyone is on edge, wondering if Russia is about to invade, and if so, how the United States will respond. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  I could, of course, be describing the situation leading up to the invasion of Ukraine last month, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=20.32s)]
*  but actually I'm describing what was happening right here in this country, in Poland, in 1980. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=24.56s)]
*  Good evening. Poland and the possibility of Soviet military intervention was the subject of an unusual White House statement this afternoon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=33.6s)]
*  In that statement, President Carter said, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  The United States is watching with growing concern the unprecedented buildup of Soviet forces along the Polish border and the closing of certain frontier regions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=43.84s)]
*  The statement also said that military intervention in Poland would have the most negative consequences. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=54.08s)]
*  Senior officials are operating on the assumption that the last thing the Russians want to do is invade Poland, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=60.08s)]
*  recognizing an invasion will make everything much worse. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=65.84s)]
*  But at the same time, the Russians continue to increase their military pressure on Poland. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=69.36s)]
*  For example, on both sides of the East German-Polish border, a 40-mile-wide strip has been closed to foreign observers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=74.32s)]
*  There are 10 Soviet divisions, about 100,000 troops in this area. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=82.24s)]
*  On Poland's Eastern Front, from the Baltic military district in the North to the Carpathian in the South, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  Soviet forces are in what officials here call an enhanced state of readiness. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=93.28s)]
*  The consequences from the point of view of the West, I think, have been made clear to the Soviet leadership in a number of, through a number of channels. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=98.24s)]
*  Now this standoff with the Soviet Union was sparked by the success of a nascent pro-democracy movement here in Poland. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=108.8s)]
*  You'll remember it, the Solidarity Movement, which began as labor strikes in a Polish shipyard [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=118.72s)]
*  and quickly grew into a national phenomenon under its charismatic leader, Lech Walesa. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=124.8s)]
*  The communist government in Poland was being forced into compromises with these democratic labor activists, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=129.6s)]
*  and the Soviet Union didn't like that one bit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=135.92s)]
*  In the end, though, the Soviet Union didn't need to invade Poland. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  The communist Polish government declared martial law and staged its own military invention. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=143.04s)]
*  Protests were brutally put down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=149.92s)]
*  Demonstrators were killed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=152.16s)]
*  Thousands of opposition activists were imprisoned. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=154.56s)]
*  But that wasn't the end of the story. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=156.88s)]
*  Actually, it was just the beginning of the story. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=158.32s)]
*  Because the Solidarity Movement wasn't destroyed, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=161.76s)]
*  it operated underground through years of repression until it burst back into the open in the late 1980s [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=164.4s)]
*  and forced the government into something that had never happened in the history of communist Eastern Europe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=172.16s)]
*  Free and fair elections. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  The unthinkable was happening before their eyes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Poles relished every new result, which taken together added up to a crushing defeat [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  for the previously unquestioned masters of Poland, the Communist Party. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=188.88s)]
*  It's one step in our escape from serfdom, from communism. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=193.52s)]
*  Solidarity computed that its candidates would completely control the new Polish Senate [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  and win every contested seat in the more powerful Sejm, the other house in Poland's parliament. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  In Gdansk, however, Lech Waleso was not gloating. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=207.84s)]
*  We all must rebuild Poland, he said, no matter who won. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=211.28s)]
*  With their first step towards democracy successfully taken, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  Poles descended on the Chinese embassy to protest the repression in that country. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  They had confronted their Communist Party at the ballot box and not a single drop of blood had been shed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=223.28s)]
*  The first domino to fall in the collapse of the Soviet Union fell right here in Poland. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=231.12s)]
*  The leader of Solidarity, Lech Waleso, became Poland's first democratically elected president. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  Anti-communist revolutions swept across Eastern Europe. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=242.72000000000003s)]
*  The Berlin Wall came down. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=246.4s)]
*  In less than three years, the Soviet Union was no more. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OQ7rDGjdnA&t=247.84s)]
