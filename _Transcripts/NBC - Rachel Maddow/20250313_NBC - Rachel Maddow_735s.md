# 'A sham': Federal judge blasts Trump admin on improper firings of federal workers; orders rehiring
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw)
*  Thousands of people fired by Donald Trump are getting their jobs back today because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the first round of proverbial fireworks that went off in a California federal courthouse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And I just, just, just got the transcript of what happened there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=11.18s)]
*  Trying all day to get it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=14.92s)]
*  Finally got it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=15.92s)]
*  I really want to share this with you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=16.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=17.92s)]
*  So let me set the scene. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=18.92s)]
*  Trump administration has sent a lawyer to defend them in this case in federal court [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=21.8s)]
*  in Northern California. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=26.72s)]
*  But they are refusing to send any officials from the Trump administration to testify in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=28.48s)]
*  this case, to explain what they have done and to be questioned about it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=33.92s)]
*  The basis of this case is that the Trump White House, the Office of Personnel Management [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=39.44s)]
*  and the Trump White House told federal agencies last month, essentially, to fire tens of thousands [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=43.32s)]
*  of people who work for the government, potentially hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=49.0s)]
*  And then after the Trump White House, the Office of Personnel Management told the agencies [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=53.88s)]
*  to fire all those people, then all those people got fired. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=58.0s)]
*  And it really does not seem like that was legal. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=62.8s)]
*  It has never seemed like that was legal, that the White House would have the authority to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=65.36s)]
*  make those kinds of mass firings. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=69.62s)]
*  But again, they won't send anybody to testify about what exactly they did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=72.28s)]
*  So this is from the transcript. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=77.6s)]
*  So the lawyer who is suing the Trump administration says this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=79.4s)]
*  Your honor, quote, what we have before the court is record evidence that conclusively [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=83.92s)]
*  establishes that OPM directed the terminations at issue. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=87.82s)]
*  We have a very unusual circumstance where the government has not mounted, has not attempted [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=91.82s)]
*  to say that they factually dispute that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=97.1s)]
*  They have actually withdrawn the declaration by which they were attempting to dispute that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=99.86s)]
*  And there's no record evidence on the other side by which they have disputed this fact. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  The judge. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  I tend to agree with you on that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  And the government, I believe, has tried to frustrate the judge's ability to get at the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=113.1s)]
*  truth of what happened here and then set forth sham declarations to a sham declaration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  They withdrew it, then substituted another. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=124.14s)]
*  That's not the way it works in the U.S. district court, the judge says. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  Quote, I'm going to talk to the government about that in a minute. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=129.94s)]
*  I had expected to have an evidentiary hearing today in which these people would testify. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=133.18s)]
*  And if they wanted to get your people on the stand, I was going to make that happen, too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=138.6s)]
*  It would be fair. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=141.74s)]
*  But instead, we have been frustrated in that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=142.74s)]
*  The judge then says to the lawyer for the plaintiffs, quote, I'd like to hear your views on what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=146.46s)]
*  relief should be issued today. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=150.66s)]
*  T.O.D.A.Y. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=152.9s)]
*  Today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=153.9s)]
*  The lawyer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=154.9s)]
*  Thank you, your honor. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=155.9s)]
*  We are aligned in wanting that to happen as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=159.22s)]
*  He spelled out T.O.D.A.Y. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  And so then they have a conversation that the judge and the lawyer for the plaintiffs, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=166.58s)]
*  the lawyer who's suing the Trump administration on behalf of the fired employees, and they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  talk about what the fired employees who are suing the Trump administration, what they're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=175.7s)]
*  seeking from the judge today, the kind of relief they want. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=179.94s)]
*  They say they want a list of everybody who's been fired that haven't been able to get that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  or even an enumeration from the government of how many people have been fired. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  They also want people to be reinstated if they have been fired illegally. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  So they go through all those details. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=195.1s)]
*  Then it's time for the Trump administration lawyer to make his side of the case. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  And he starts explaining to the judge that all these fired workers, the only reason they [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=200.86s)]
*  were fired is because nobody wanted them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=205.22000000000003s)]
*  Nobody told anybody to fire anything. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  There was no instructions to fire people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=212.06s)]
*  These are just unwanted workers. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=213.82000000000002s)]
*  If anybody wanted them back, they surely would have been rehired by now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=215.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=219.3s)]
*  At which point the judge interjects. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=220.3s)]
*  The judge, quote, Well, maybe that's why we need an injunction that tells them to rehire [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=228.3s)]
*  You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=229.66s)]
*  You are afraid to do so because you know cross-examination would reveal the truth. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=232.84s)]
*  Trump administration lawyer tries to interject. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=237.98s)]
*  Respectfully, the judge continues. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=240.22s)]
*  This is the U.S. district court. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=242.5s)]
*  Whenever you submit declarations, those people should be submitted to cross-examination, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=244.94s)]
*  just like the plaintiff's side should be. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  And we then we we get at the truth of whether your story is actually true. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=255.3s)]
*  I tend to doubt that you are telling me the truth. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=256.54s)]
*  Whenever we hear all the evidence, eventually. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=259.22s)]
*  Why can't you bring your people in to be cross-examined or to be deposed at their convenience? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=261.66s)]
*  I said two hours for Mr. Ezell. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=266.66s)]
*  Mr. Ezell is the acting head of OPM. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=269.14000000000004s)]
*  I said two hours for Mr. Ezell, a deposition at his convenience. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=271.74s)]
*  And you withdrew his declaration rather than do that? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=275.48s)]
*  Come on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=278.18s)]
*  That's a sham. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=279.18s)]
*  The judge says, quote, Go ahead. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm I'm it upsets me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=282.66s)]
*  I want you to know that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  I have been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years, and I know how we [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=286.26s)]
*  get at the truth. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=291.14s)]
*  And you're not helping me get at the truth. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=292.74s)]
*  You're giving me press releases, sham documents. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=294.58s)]
*  All right, he says, quote, I'm getting mad at you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=298.74s)]
*  And I shouldn't. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  The judge then decided in this hearing today that he wasn't going to wait to give a written [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=306.58s)]
*  ruling. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=310.78s)]
*  He decided, you know what, I've heard enough. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=311.78s)]
*  He decided he was going to rule from the bench today. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=314.04s)]
*  T.O.D.A.Y. today. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  We started with this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  The judge, quote, On February 13th, 2025, a briefing paper from Human Resources Management [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  at the Forest Service says this, quote, All that's spelled A.L.L., all federal agencies, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=327.04s)]
*  including the Department of Agriculture, were notified on February 12th by the Office of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=334.6s)]
*  Personnel Management to terminate all employees who have not completed their probationary [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=338.5s)]
*  or trial period. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=343.04s)]
*  That then led to the termination of a lot of people, the judge says. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=344.54s)]
*  But one in particular I will give as an example. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  Leandra Bailey was a physical science information specialist in Albuquerque. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=350.72s)]
*  In September of last year, she'd received a performance review in which she was, quote, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=355.6s)]
*  fully successful in every category, not just some, but every category. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=359.8s)]
*  On February 13th, she was terminated using the OPM template letter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=364.92s)]
*  In addition to directing these terminations, OPM gave a proposed letter. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=370.44s)]
*  And the letter said, I'm reading from it, Memorandum for Leandra Bailey, February 13th, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=374.8s)]
*  from the Director of Human Source Management at the U.S. Forest Service. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=379.88s)]
*  This is just one sentence, quote, The agency finds, based on your performance, that you [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=383.16s)]
*  have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=387.56s)]
*  close quote. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=391.96s)]
*  And then the judge says this, despite the fact that her most recent review was fully [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=392.96s)]
*  successful in every category. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=398.0s)]
*  The judge says, now how could it be, you might ask, that the agency could find that based [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=400.3s)]
*  on her performance when her performance had been stellar? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=406.38s)]
*  The reason OPM wanted to put this based on performance was at least in part, in my judgment, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=410.68s)]
*  a gimmick. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=416.1s)]
*  Because the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=418.02s)]
*  And the judge says this, now what I'm about to say is not the legal basis for what I'm [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=422.1s)]
*  going to order today, but I just want to say it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  He says, quote, it is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=429.38s)]
*  based on performance when they know good and well, that's a lie. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=435.34s)]
*  Excellent in all, fully, what was the phrase? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  I don't want to misstate it, quote, fully successful in every category, yet they terminate [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  her based on her performance. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=445.02s)]
*  That should not have been done in our country. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=451.02s)]
*  It also happens to be that whenever you fire somebody based on performance, then they can't [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  get unemployment insurance. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=458.74s)]
*  So that makes it even worse, doesn't it? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=459.74s)]
*  And then it makes it even worse because the next employer is going to say, well, have [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=461.66s)]
*  you ever been terminated based on performance? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=465.32s)]
*  They're going to have to say yes to thousands of people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=467.66s)]
*  It is illustrative of the manipulation that was going on by OPM to try to orchestrate [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=472.98s)]
*  this government-wide termination of probationary employees. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=477.26s)]
*  Quote, the court finds that OPM did direct all the agencies to terminate probationary [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=481.74s)]
*  employees. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=487.18s)]
*  The court rejects the government's attempt to use these press releases and to read between [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=489.06s)]
*  the lines to say that the agency heads made their own decision with no direction from [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=492.7s)]
*  OPM. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=496.58s)]
*  The relief that's going to be granted is as follows. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=497.58s)]
*  First, the temporary restraining order will be extended. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  The VA shall immediately offer reinstatement to any and all probationary employees terminated [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=503.94s)]
*  on or about February 13th or 14th. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=508.86s)]
*  This order finds that all such terminations were directed by defendant OPM and were unlawful [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=512.1s)]
*  because OPM had no authority to do so. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=517.5s)]
*  Further, the VA shall cease any and all use of the template termination notice provided [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=520.18s)]
*  by OPM and shall immediately advise all probationary employees terminated February 13th and 14th [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=524.9s)]
*  that the notice and termination have been found to be unlawful by the U.S. District [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=531.1s)]
*  Court for the Northern District of California. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=535.14s)]
*  The VA shall cease any termination of probationary employees at the direction of OPM. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=537.82s)]
*  holds that OPM has no authority whatsoever to direct, order, or require in any way that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=544.74s)]
*  any agency fire any employee. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=550.94s)]
*  Now, given the arguments and the facts in this case, namely that defendants have attempted [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=554.54s)]
*  to recast these directives as mere guidance, my order today, quote, further prohibits defendants [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=559.74s)]
*  from giving guidance as to whether any employee should be terminated. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=566.66s)]
*  Any termination of agencies' employees must be made by the agencies themselves if made [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=572.42s)]
*  at all, and they must be made in conformity with the Civil Service Reform Act and the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=576.66s)]
*  Reduction in Force Act and any other constitutional or statutory legal requirement. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=580.6999999999999s)]
*  He says, quote, in seven calendar days, relief defendant VA, the VA shall submit a list of [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  all probationary employees terminated on or about February 13th and 14th with an explanation [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  as to each of what has been done to comply with this order. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=600.18s)]
*  Then the judge says this, now this order so far has only mentioned the VA, the Veterans [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=605.02s)]
*  Administration, but the same relief is extended, and I'm not going to repeat it, but I'm extending [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=608.38s)]
*  the same relief to the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=613.4599999999999s)]
*  of Energy, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Treasury. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=617.66s)]
*  And so it's the VA plus all those other agencies. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=621.18s)]
*  He says, and this is without prejudice to extending the relief later in further, to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=624.18s)]
*  other agencies. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=629.06s)]
*  The judge then closes with this, I will try to get out a short memorandum opinion that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=631.7399999999999s)]
*  elaborates on this order, but this is the order and it counts effective immediately. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=635.2199999999999s)]
*  Please don't say, oh, I'm waiting for the written order. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=640.6999999999999s)]
*  This is the order from the bench. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  And then the judge then closes with this admonition to the Trump administration lawyer, quote, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=648.0999999999999s)]
*  if you want to appeal to the Court of Appeals, God bless you. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=652.78s)]
*  I want you to, because I'm tired of seeing you stonewall on trying to get at the truth. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=656.62s)]
*  And that is how thousands of people who work in our government, who Donald Trump and his [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=666.38s)]
*  top campaign donor tried to fire, that is how thousands of Americans got their jobs [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=672.5s)]
*  back today. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  At the VA, at USDA, at the Defense Department, at the Department of Energy, at the Department [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=679.18s)]
*  of Interior, which includes the National Park Service, at the Treasury Department, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=683.78s)]
*  which of course includes the IRS. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=688.14s)]
*  Court ruling also means that the Office of Personnel Management, which they've been [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=691.5799999999999s)]
*  using as like the central office for all this stuff that Doge has been doing, right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=696.06s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management at the White House can no longer tell anyone anything [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=700.6999999999999s)]
*  about anybody who should be fired for any reason from any part of the US government. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=706.18s)]
*  This is the order. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=089i2Ex5Nlw&t=713.22s)]
