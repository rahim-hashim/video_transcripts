# Trump is a repeat loser as his slash-and-burn rampage collides with U.S. law
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo)
*  Today was yet another really, really bad day for Donald Trump in court. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, 24,000 people who Trump has fired from federal government jobs got reinstated, thanks [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  to a court order from a federal judge in Maryland. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=13.0s)]
*  This is the lawsuit that was brought by 20 Democratic attorneys general in 19 states [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=15.88s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=20.28s)]
*  This judge's order today forces the reinstatement of, again, 24,000 people that Trump has fired [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=21.72s)]
*  from 18 different agencies. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=27.98s)]
*  The Education Department, the FDIC, which is the agency that provides insurance so your [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=29.92s)]
*  bank deposits are insured and you don't have to worry about them going away if you put [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  your money in a bank. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=39.28s)]
*  They're going after FDIC, too. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=40.28s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=42.6s)]
*  The Commerce Department, Health and Human Services, Energy Department, the VA, Interior [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=43.6s)]
*  Department, Labor Department, USDA, General Services Administration, the Small Business [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=47.36s)]
*  Administration, the Transportation Department, the Treasury, the EPA, the Consumer Financial [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=52.28s)]
*  Protection Bureau, USAID. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=56.44s)]
*  Again, 24,000 employees fired by the Trump administration from those entities reinstated [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=59.32s)]
*  by that court ruling today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=66.2s)]
*  And speaking of USAID, additionally, on top of that ruling where USAID employees are reinstated [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=70.12s)]
*  by court order along with all those other agencies, a standalone blockbuster ruling [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  from another federal judge today specifically ordering the Trump administration to reconstitute [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=81.34s)]
*  USAID. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=87.48s)]
*  And stop their efforts to shut it down, even to let them back into their building. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  The judge in this case said that the shutdown of USAID, quote, likely violated the United [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=94.84s)]
*  States Constitution in multiple ways. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=99.84s)]
*  And in his very short two page order today, he ordered that the Trump administration must [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=102.92s)]
*  reopen USAID. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=108.12s)]
*  This is from the order. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=112.36s)]
*  Quote, for purposes of the order, defendants refers to Elon Musk in his official capacity, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=113.36s)]
*  the United States DOJ service and their officers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=119.44s)]
*  Also, all individuals who at any time since the inauguration have served in the role of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=125.48s)]
*  DOJ team member or DOJ leader, regardless of the formal personnel status of that individual. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=131.12s)]
*  So the defendants here, everybody associated with Elon Musk and DOJ. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=138.2s)]
*  And those defendants are, quote, enjoined as follows. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=143.12s)]
*  Defendants shall reinstate access to email payment, security notification and all other [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  electronic systems, including restoring deleted emails to for all current USAID employees [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  and contractors, whether in active status or on administrative leave, meaning for all [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  the people they've tried to force out of the agency to they need to be reinstated. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=164.36s)]
*  They get all their emails back. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=168.9s)]
*  They get all their systems back. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=170.12s)]
*  Defendants shall provide written confirmation to the court that this requirement has been [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=172.56s)]
*  satisfied within seven days of the date of this order. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=176.0s)]
*  Also, defendants shall not take any action or engage in any work relating to the shutdown [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=179.56s)]
*  of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, employee terminations, reductions in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=184.88s)]
*  force, contract terminations related to any USAID employees or contractors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  There can be no termination of USAID contracts or grants, no closures of USAID buildings [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=196.08s)]
*  or bureaus or offices, no permanent shutdowns or terminations of any USAID IT systems. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=202.44s)]
*  Within 14 days, defendants shall submit to this court a written agreement among all necessary [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=211.68s)]
*  parties that ensures that USAID will be able to reoccupy its building, will be able to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=216.76s)]
*  reoccupy USAID headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=223.36s)]
*  So they all get their jobs back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=229.08s)]
*  They get back in the building. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  They get all their emails back and all electronic systems related to the operations of that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=232.8s)]
*  agency, including all contracts and everything that applies both to employees and contractors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=238.68s)]
*  You need to stand that agency back up because what you have done to shut it down thus far, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  quote, likely violated the U.S. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=253.12s)]
*  Constitution in multiple ways. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=255.28s)]
*  Now, this, of course, will be appealed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=257.0s)]
*  This will not be the final word. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=259.08s)]
*  You know, even if Trump and his top campaign donor, Elon Musk, continue to lose this badly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=260.72s)]
*  in court on this case, there's no telling how they'll try to finagle their way out [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=267.32s)]
*  of it anyway. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=270.84s)]
*  But, you know, thinking about thinking about the dimmer switch between democracy and dictatorship, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=273.24s)]
*  thinking about the dimmer switch between democracy and dictatorship, the courts here are drawing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=281.44s)]
*  a line. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=287.88s)]
*  And for all, you know, Trump and Musk's sadistic glee about calling these people who work for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=289.88s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=296.04s)]
*  Government criminals and, you know, removing their name from the building and Elon Musk [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=297.04s)]
*  giggling and talking about putting it in a woodshipper, for all of their glee and sadism [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=302.2s)]
*  about this stuff, they're losing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=307.82s)]
*  They're losing under U.S. law. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=310.44s)]
*  USAID, as of today, is hereby ordered back into existence under federal law. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=312.52s)]
*  Trump was also soundly beaten in court today in his effort to try to throw trans service [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=320.88s)]
*  members out of the military. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=325.04s)]
*  Now, the judge's ruling in this case is very measured and calm, but it just rips the Trump [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=326.56s)]
*  administration for even trying to say this is legal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=332.28s)]
*  Essentially, the judge ruled in this case today that the Trump administration never [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=336.04s)]
*  actually presented a real legal argument for why they think they're allowed to do this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=340.52s)]
*  They just asserted with no supporting evidence that anybody who's trans, by definition, is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=345.24s)]
*  unfit for military service. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=351.24s)]
*  And legally, that's not how it works. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=353.9s)]
*  The judge said the service records of the plaintiffs, the people who brought this case, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=355.96s)]
*  who all have stellar military records, the judge points out that the experience of just [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=360.44s)]
*  these plaintiffs in the military disproves that they are somehow manifestly unfit just [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=365.56s)]
*  because of who they are. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=370.88s)]
*  So the judge issued an injunction against the Trump administration in enforcing this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=373.4s)]
*  new ban on trans people serving in the military. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=378.48s)]
*  The judge wrote this in her ruling, quote, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=381.88s)]
*  And that, of course, is a quote from the Federalist Papers, from Federalist Number 51, by James Madison. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=395.56s)]
*  The ruling continues, quote, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=404.6s)]
*  The military defends every day. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=425.56s)]
*  The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=429.16s)]
*  In the self-evident truth that all people are created equal, all means all. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=432.52s)]
*  Nothing more and certainly nothing less. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=439.52s)]
*  End quote. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=443.8s)]
*  Trump administration just had a terrible day in the nation's courts today. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=447.0s)]
*  They lost in court on their efforts to fire tens of thousands of people who work for 18 [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=453.32s)]
*  different government agencies. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  They lost in court on shutting down USAID. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=461.64s)]
*  They lost in court on discriminating in this way against trans people. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=464.96s)]
*  And Republicans supporting Trump are facing incredible blowback in their home districts [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=470.91999999999996s)]
*  from their own constituents. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO8V1iE82xo&t=476.52s)]
