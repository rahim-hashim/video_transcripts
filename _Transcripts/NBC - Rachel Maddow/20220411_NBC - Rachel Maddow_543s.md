# Kremlin Critic Kara-Murza Reportedly Arrested In Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY)
*  Mr. Kara Mertzah apparently haunts the dreams of Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=0.0s)]
*  The first major opposition figure to emerge as a potential rival to Vladimir Putin was [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=5.84s)]
*  an entrepreneur billionaire who ran the one Russian oil company that actually knew what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=11.0s)]
*  it was doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=16.56s)]
*  His name was Mikhail Khodorkovsky. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=17.56s)]
*  I actually wrote about this extensively in a book that I wrote a couple of years ago [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=19.44s)]
*  called Blowout. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=23.5s)]
*  If you ever want to read this back story here, I think it is an amazing story. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=24.5s)]
*  Basically this guy, this entrepreneur billionaire guy, he became the richest businessman in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=28.98s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=33.94s)]
*  He then challenged Putin. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=35.08s)]
*  He made this public challenge that Russia needs to be a real democracy and the government [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=36.78s)]
*  needs to stop stealing everything and stop being so corrupt. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=40.82s)]
*  That was such a threat to Vladimir Putin that Putin had him arrested on made up charges, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  seized his company and took it for himself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=50.66s)]
*  And then Putin had the guy locked up in prison for a decade. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=54.18s)]
*  After he got out of prison, at the end of a decade, he fled the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=58.14s)]
*  He now lives in exile. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=61.74s)]
*  But Mikhail Khodorkovsky founded a pro-democracy group that operates internationally. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=64.06s)]
*  It's called Open Russia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=68.94s)]
*  And it advocates for democracy in Russia, for civil society. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=70.84s)]
*  It advocates against corruption in Russia. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=73.78s)]
*  That of course is very threatening to Vladimir Putin after Khodorkovsky himself threatened [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=77.34s)]
*  him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=81.26s)]
*  Putin was then threatened by the organization that Khodorkovsky founded. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=82.26s)]
*  And so Putin, of course, had the organization banned. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=86.02s)]
*  He had Open Russia declared illegal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=88.5s)]
*  But until Open Russia was banned, the guy who was running it was Vladimir Kara-Mertzah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=91.34s)]
*  And he keeps popping up in places like this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=97.42s)]
*  The next real credible rival to Vladimir Putin was this man, a charismatic opposition politician [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  named Boris Nemtsov. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=105.64s)]
*  Nemtsov was brilliant, really well spoken. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=107.64s)]
*  He was a physicist by training. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  He was six foot five. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=111.25999999999999s)]
*  He held a lot of different prominent public offices in Russia, including being deputy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=113.5s)]
*  prime minister. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=116.86s)]
*  And he emerged ultimately as this outspoken crusader against corruption in the Russian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=118.94s)]
*  government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=123.66s)]
*  And so naturally, just like Khodorkovsky before him, Boris Nemtsov emerged as a huge threat [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=126.1s)]
*  to Putin. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=132.98s)]
*  For one thing, he was another real credible challenger to Putin. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=134.02s)]
*  And so of course he had to go too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=138.02s)]
*  With him, they didn't go through the trouble that they went through with the oil guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=141.42s)]
*  They didn't go through the trouble of arresting him and jailing him and stealing his company [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=145.5s)]
*  and exiling him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=149.5s)]
*  For Boris Nemtsov, they went a simpler route. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=151.98s)]
*  They just killed him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=154.1s)]
*  Four bullets in the back for Boris Nemtsov as he walked along the street just outside [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=155.1s)]
*  the Kremlin. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=159.77999999999997s)]
*  That was in 2015. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=160.77999999999997s)]
*  But here too, again, we find our friend Vladimir Kara-Mertzah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=164.1s)]
*  There is a foundation named for Boris Nemtsov. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  It supports journalism, supports freedom of the press. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=170.64s)]
*  Every year they give the Boris Nemtsov prize for courage in upholding democratic values. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  Vladimir Kara-Mertzah runs that foundation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  He ran the foundation that was founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=181.76s)]
*  He ran the foundation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  He runs the foundation, founded in the name of Boris Nemtsov. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the pattern here is clear. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=191.27999999999997s)]
*  Part of the way Vladimir Putin stays in power in Russia is that he keeps imprisoning and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=194.16s)]
*  killing all the opposition figures in Russia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=198.92s)]
*  They've got Alexei Navalny in jail now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=201.6s)]
*  After nearly killing him with poison, they had Mikhail Khodorkovsky in jail for a decade. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=204.33999999999997s)]
*  Now he's in exile. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=209.32s)]
*  Boris Nemtsov, they had him just gunned down in the street. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=210.32s)]
*  But the opposition, it keeps trying. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=214.92s)]
*  It keeps going. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=217.2s)]
*  Vladimir Kara-Mertzah, linked to all these opposition figures, a very high profile opposition [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=219.48s)]
*  figure in his own right, carrying on the work of all these killed and imprisoned leaders [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=224.98s)]
*  to keep the opposition alive in Russia, literally alive and politically alive. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=229.5s)]
*  And he has paid the price for it too. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=237.54s)]
*  In 2015, Vladimir Kara-Mertzah was poisoned. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=239.26s)]
*  Him too. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=243.38s)]
*  Multiple organ failure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=244.38s)]
*  He had to learn to walk again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=245.6s)]
*  It took him a year and a half to recover when he was poisoned in 2015. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=246.98s)]
*  But he lived. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=250.92s)]
*  Then two years later, he was traveling in Russia, inside Russia, promoting a documentary [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  about the life and the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=257.24s)]
*  Somehow Vladimir Kara-Mertzah was poisoned again. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=261.4s)]
*  Twice in two years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  Again, in and out of a coma. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=267.08s)]
*  Multiple organ failure. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=268.88s)]
*  Again. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=270.4s)]
*  His wife somehow got him out of Russia and into the United States for him to try to recover [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=271.4s)]
*  here. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=275.68s)]
*  Doctors here told her that he had a 5% chance of survival. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=276.68s)]
*  And he survived. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=281.6s)]
*  And in 2017, as he was still recovering from that second assassination attempt, in fact, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=284.6s)]
*  he was right here on this show. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=290.8s)]
*  We saw the offices of Alexei Navalny's organization get ransacked and have all their computers [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=294.56s)]
*  and all their paperwork and all their staff getting arrested. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=300.74s)]
*  Open Russia getting banned this week. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=304.52000000000004s)]
*  The raid on your offices there this week. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  How do you maintain any sort of momentum, any sort of organizing structure against that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=308.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, the other side, if you just look at it formally, the other side, of course, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=317.8s)]
*  does have a massive advantage, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=321.64s)]
*  They have all the so-called law enforcement agencies. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=322.64s)]
*  They have the entire propaganda machine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  They have the whole power of the state on their side. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=327.12s)]
*  But what we have, I think, is something much more important. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=329.76s)]
*  And that is the truth. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  As Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine grinds on now, we're in what, day 44, day 45? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=334.0s)]
*  As tonight we feel the first unconfirmed reports that Russian forces may have used a chemical [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  weapon in Ukraine. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  As the number of Russians arrested for opposing Putin's war dwarfs the number of arrests [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  we saw even from the big opposition protests in Russia in 2012 and 2017. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=355.17999999999995s)]
*  As Putin has now eliminated the last vestiges of the independent press in that country, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=360.52s)]
*  as he has made it a criminal act to even call the war in Ukraine a war, as thousands, as [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=365.4s)]
*  tens of thousands of Russian citizens have fled their own country, probably permanently, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=370.76s)]
*  to escape Putin and what he is doing now to Russia as he wages this war. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=376.08s)]
*  This man, Vladimir Karamurtza, has stayed to try to keep the opposition to Putin alive. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=381.4s)]
*  Or perhaps to die trying. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=389.44s)]
*  Yesterday he spoke with Ali Velshi from Moscow. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=393.68s)]
*  Today Vladimir Karamurtza was arrested. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=397.8s)]
*  He was seized by the Russian authorities. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=400.64s)]
*  Was first reported by Russian dissident chess champion Garry Kasparov. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=403.0s)]
*  Was later confirmed by the Boris Nemtsov Foundation, which Mr. Karamurtza leads. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=406.52s)]
*  Mr. Karamurtza was taken earlier today by Russian authorities. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=411.88s)]
*  His whereabouts tonight are unknown. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=415.52s)]
*  When he spoke with Ali just yesterday, I don't want to say that he knew it was coming, but [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  he knew it was in Russia at this time, still speaking his mind. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=426.28s)]
*  And he was eyes open, facing it head on. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=431.28s)]
*  Are you worried about speaking out against the Russian government and against this war [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  and invasion from Russia? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=440.12s)]
*  We all know the price. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=441.84s)]
*  We all know the cost. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=442.84s)]
*  But we also know that there are millions of people in Russia who categorically oppose [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  Putin regime and everything it's doing, both in terms of domestic repression and in terms [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=449.32s)]
*  of external aggression. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U6OZDXxQtY&t=453.15999999999997s)]
