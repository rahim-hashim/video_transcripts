# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 25
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc)
*  Joining us now is Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist expert on Russian state intelligence apparatus, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=0.0s)]
*  the author of The Compatriots, the brutal and chaotic history of Russia's exiles, emigres, and agents abroad. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=6.76s)]
*  Andrei, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=14.52s)]
*  There's something so interesting in your reporting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=17.8s)]
*  Your sources do not believe that these disappearances in Vladimir Putin's inner circle are punishment for the war not going the way they planned. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=20.32s)]
*  But they might actually be a mole hunt. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=28.92s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=30.96s)]
*  Yes, we got some reports to actually two to weeks ago that Vladimir Putin decided to attack the FSB, as you rightly mentioned, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=33.56s)]
*  and the head of the espionage unit of the FSB was placed under house arrest. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=44.32s)]
*  And the first report indicated that he was placed under house arrest because the intelligence provided to Putin before the invasion was not extremely accurate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=51.0s)]
*  They didn't expect any resistance for the Russian troops. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=63.36s)]
*  And we know now that's actually what is happening is the fierce resistance from the Ukrainians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=68.8s)]
*  But it looks like now it's becoming something else. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=77.4s)]
*  It's not only about bad intelligence and it's not only about misusing of funds allocated by the government to cultivate political groups in Ukraine, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=80.76s)]
*  which would be more supportive of the Russian invasion, but it's also about trying to find a source of the US intelligence and why this US intelligence before the war was so accurate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  And it started with the FSB and this particular unit because this unit was also in charge of maintaining official contacts with CIA. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=104.16s)]
*  So they started there because these guys were known to have at least some contacts with the American intelligence. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=112.96s)]
*  Now, let's talk about the defense minister Shoigu being out of the public eye. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, this is not a name or a person with whom our Western audiences are familiar. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=126.52s)]
*  Why tell me about why this was such a big deal that he was he seemed to be very active at the beginning of the invasion and then suddenly seemed to have disappeared for two weeks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=131.84s)]
*  And now there's questions about whether this video that he was on is really current or from from two weeks ago. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=140.12s)]
*  Well, first of all, this war is very different from what we had before with Putin. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  And we had a war in Chechnya and Georgia and in Syria. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=153.16s)]
*  And in all these wars, we have a commander who was in charge of the operation on the battlefield. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=157.44s)]
*  This war is different because we do not have such a person. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=163.68s)]
*  The public face of the war from the military side is Sergei Shoigu, the minister of defense, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=167.24s)]
*  despite the fact that he has no military training, no military education, and he's an engineer by his training. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=172.4s)]
*  Nevertheless, because he was always extremely close to Putin, they spent their holidays together. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=180.6s)]
*  And Shoigu is a very popular politician in the country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=186.64s)]
*  He became a public face of the war. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  Now he disappeared for almost two weeks and there is no public explanation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=193.16s)]
*  There are some rumors that maybe he had some problems with his heart. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=198.2s)]
*  Maybe the problem is that the war is not going the way everybody in Moscow wanted to go. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=202.0s)]
*  Let me sketch out a situation for you and ask you if it sounds familiar. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=208.76s)]
*  Russia begins amassing troops on another country's borders. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  The United States calls out Russia's belligerent moves and warns it not to invade. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=217.32s)]
*  Everyone is on edge wondering if Russia is about to invade and if so, how the United States will respond. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=221.88s)]
*  I could, of course, be describing the situation leading up to the invasion of Ukraine last month. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=229.16s)]
*  But actually, I'm describing what was happening right here in this country, in Poland, in 1980. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=233.28s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=242.28s)]
*  Poland and the possibility of Soviet military intervention was the subject of an unusual White House statement this afternoon. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=243.32s)]
*  In that statement, President Carter said, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=250.24s)]
*  The United States is watching with growing concern the unprecedented buildup of Soviet forces along the Polish border and the closing of certain frontier regions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=252.6s)]
*  The statement also said that military intervention in Poland would have the most negative consequences. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=262.8s)]
*  Senior officials are operating on the assumption that the last thing the Russians want to do is invade Poland. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=268.76s)]
*  Recognizing an invasion will make everything much worse. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  But at the same time, the Russians continue to increase their military pressure on Poland. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=278.16s)]
*  For example, on both sides of the East German-Polish border, a 40 mile wide strip has been closed to foreign observers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=283.04s)]
*  There are 10 Soviet divisions, about 100,000 troops in this area. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=290.92s)]
*  On Poland's Eastern Front, from the Baltic military district in the north to the Carpathian in the south, Soviet forces are in what officials here call an enhanced state of readiness. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=295.84s)]
*  The consequences from the point of view of the West, I think, have been made clear to the Soviet leadership in a number of, through a number of channels. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=306.96s)]
*  Now, this standoff with the Soviet Union was sparked by the success of a nascent pro-democracy movement here in Poland. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=316.8s)]
*  You'll remember it, the Solidarity Movement, which began as labor strikes in a Polish shipyard and quickly grew into a national phenomenon under its charismatic leader, Lech Walesa. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=327.2s)]
*  The communist government in Poland was being forced into compromises with these democratic labor activists, and the Soviet Union didn't like that one bit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=338.72s)]
*  In the end, though, the Soviet Union didn't need to invade Poland. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=348.04s)]
*  The communist Polish government declared martial law and staged its own military invention. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=351.72s)]
*  Protests were brutally put down. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=358.56s)]
*  Demonstrators were killed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=360.76s)]
*  Thousands of opposition activists were imprisoned. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=363.12s)]
*  But that wasn't the end of the story. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=365.6s)]
*  Actually, it was just the beginning of the story. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=366.92s)]
*  Because the Solidarity Movement wasn't destroyed, it operated underground through years of repression until it burst back into the open in the late 1980s and forced the government into something that had never happened in the history of communist Eastern Europe, free and fair elections. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  The unthinkable was happening before their eyes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=390.68s)]
*  Poles relished every new result, which taken together added up to a crushing defeat for the previously unquestioned masters of Poland, the Communist Party. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=393.36s)]
*  It's one step in our escape from serfdom, from communism. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=402.2s)]
*  Solidarity computed that its candidates would completely control the new Polish Senate and win every contested seat in the more powerful Sejm, the other house in Poland's parliament. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  In Gdansk, however, Lech Walesa was not gloating. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=416.6s)]
*  We all must rebuild Poland, he said, no matter who won. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=420.04s)]
*  With their first step towards democracy successfully taken, Poles descended on the Chinese embassy to protest the repression in that country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=423.6s)]
*  They had confronted their Communist Party at the ballot box and not a single drop of blood had been shed. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  The first domino to fall in the collapse of the Soviet Union fell right here in Poland. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=439.8s)]
*  The leader of Solidarity, Lech Walesa, became Poland's first democratically elected president. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=445.68s)]
*  Anti-communist revolutions swept across Eastern Europe. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=451.44s)]
*  The Berlin Wall came down in less than three years. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=455.12s)]
*  The Soviet Union was no more. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  One month ago today, it was the second day of the war in Ukraine. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=461.64s)]
*  And on that day, Rachel talked to a restaurant owner in the capital city of Kyiv named Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=465.68s)]
*  Like most of his compatriots, he was new to war. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=472.76s)]
*  He told Rachel that he and some of his neighbors were just learning how to survive. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=475.24s)]
*  They found some pool chairs and pillows and transformed an underground parking garage into a bunker while taking turns guarding the doors with these weapons. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=479.48s)]
*  Now, much has changed since then. Alexander is no longer sleeping in the underground garage. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=488.6s)]
*  Most of his neighbors are gone and he doesn't have the guns anymore. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=493.32s)]
*  He donated them to men on the front lines. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=497.12s)]
*  Alexander didn't leave Kyiv because he couldn't leave his parents behind. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=499.84000000000003s)]
*  But that has changed, too. They left the city a week ago. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=503.36s)]
*  He stayed. He told us today, I'm not allowed to leave the country and I don't want to be anywhere else. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=507.04s)]
*  At peace with his decision to stay in Kyiv until the end, Alexander decided to be of service. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=513.6s)]
*  He started by driving people to train stations so they could escape. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=518.36s)]
*  He then worked with other restaurant owners to prepare meals for Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=521.96s)]
*  And then one day, suddenly he received a text message from a friend that put him on a new path. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=526.64s)]
*  His friend told Alexander his relatives needed food and medicine. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=532.72s)]
*  So Alexander found the supplies and delivered them. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=536.68s)]
*  And this initiated a chain of help supported by his friends in the restaurant industry and 10 volunteers. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=539.92s)]
*  Alexander now spends most of his day delivering food to those in need about 50 to 75 bags daily containing eggs, butter, bread, chicken, milk, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=546.04s)]
*  whatever they can find. He's also picking up medicine for elderly people. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=555.92s)]
*  During one of the deliveries, he met a Ukrainian grandmother who'd been unable to leave Kyiv. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=560.4799999999999s)]
*  She was so overwhelmed by Alexander's visit that she broke down in tears. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=565.16s)]
*  She said she never expected to live her last days like this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=571.24s)]
*  As Alexander drives from district to district delivering food, he's become a witness to war. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=585.92s)]
*  He took this video that you're watching on his phone earlier this week. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=591.76s)]
*  That pile of debris is the retroville shopping center in Kyiv. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  It used to be a vibrant place that was filled with restaurants and shops. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=599.12s)]
*  They had a fancy McDonald's. It's all gone. All of it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  It was hit by a Russian missile on Monday. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  The mall was only five miles from Alexander's apartment, so he's very aware that war is moving closer to his own home. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=608.76s)]
*  He said that the anticipation feels like a game of roulette, Russian roulette, and that any day could be his day. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=614.96s)]
*  But he is ready to fight. Joining us again is Kyiv resident and restaurant owner Alexander. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=622.2s)]
*  He's a veteran of the Russian military and he's a veteran of the Russian military. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=628.92s)]
*  But he is ready to fight. Joining us again is Kyiv resident and restaurant owner Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=633.0s)]
*  Alexander, we're very grateful for you joining us tonight. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=640.04s)]
*  So much has changed in this month. So much. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=643.16s)]
*  Tell us about what your life is like now compared to a month ago. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=646.36s)]
*  Good evening. Well, it's the life has changed to anticipation of war getting closer and closer. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=651.8s)]
*  To to where where you are. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=663.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was it was already in our life, but now we can hear the bombing more often. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=665.8s)]
*  We hear the siren every I would say not every day, but at every moment, but every hour. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=672.68s)]
*  So the life has changed totally. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=683.7199999999999s)]
*  And as I heard before, now we're helping out not just people who need food, but people who need medicine. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=686.68s)]
*  And there are a lot of people with with the medicine for thyroid that is really in need. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=695.8s)]
*  And the medicine for diabetes, you cannot find it anywhere in Kiev, anywhere in Ukraine. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=707.64s)]
*  So my friends from abroad buy out this medicine and send it to me. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=714.76s)]
*  And volunteers also buying this medicine all around Kiev region. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=720.84s)]
*  And a few of my friends, even from different parts of Ukraine, also buying out this medicine and sending to me. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=726.28s)]
*  And we are giving away for free this medicine because people are really in need of it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=732.6s)]
*  So basically life had changed totally from from normal to to a nightmare for seeing these people, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=738.12s)]
*  seeing their eyes, seeing what they are really going through. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=747.0s)]
*  It's a terrible shock for for for for us and for I would say for any citizen of the world. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=751.4s)]
*  Tell me about when you say seeing them and seeing their eyes, I'm seeing them on the other side when they leave the country, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=762.12s)]
*  when they get off these trains in whether it was Hungary or or here in Poland and and it's it's women and children generally without men of fighting age because people like you can't leave. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=767.24s)]
*  What do the eyes look like on your side? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=778.44s)]
*  Well, I would say pretty much the same. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=783.0s)]
*  They are scared. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=787.0s)]
*  They're they, you know, there's two groups of people when you deliver to them food and medicine. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=787.8000000000001s)]
*  One one group is is when you're calling them and saying, OK, I'll go downstairs or I'll meet you in front of my building. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=794.76s)]
*  And the rest is saying, please come to this floor or that floor. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=802.76s)]
*  And you're going up and you see that they can't move. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=807.64s)]
*  You know, while while the bombing, while the siren goes, they can't even move to the basement. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  They don't have that time. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=818.28s)]
*  They cannot move as as though this grand grand grand woman was was she barely could move. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=819.8s)]
*  And though like more than 50 percent of people, they just cannot go anywhere. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=829.16s)]
*  So they're scared. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=835.0s)]
*  They don't have they don't have much time to to go downstairs. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=836.6s)]
*  So that's that's that's shocking because this is nothing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=841.56s)]
*  This is something abnormal that you see during these days. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=846.68s)]
*  And those grand people needs to have respect from from from from I don't know, from from the rest of from [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=851.16s)]
*  from all the world from they need to be living calm and in happy life. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=864.76s)]
*  But not like now. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=870.28s)]
*  This is this is happening right now. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=872.2s)]
*  And this is this shouldn't happen to to to this to these people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=874.84s)]
*  It's and this makes me and the rest of the people who don't want to leave makes them stay. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=881.64s)]
*  Because if not us, then who would who would help them if we will leave somewhere and hide? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=888.2s)]
*  Who will be in charge of them? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=895.24s)]
*  And this is something that everybody should know that, you know, the war it's been a whole month [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=897.64s)]
*  since the Russia attacked Ukraine and the Russians bombed by hitting residential buildings in Kiev. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=909.24s)]
*  And the large shopping mall was was was, you know, surrounding this building that was destroyed [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=917.08s)]
*  completely to the ground. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=925.8s)]
*  And, you know, as the Russian famous opposition journalist, Oksana Baulina, she was killed [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=928.52s)]
*  by a Russian military drone. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=936.68s)]
*  And while giving a report to the media. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=938.36s)]
*  So basically, you know, and the overall feeling is quite tense, but we we work every day. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=946.92s)]
*  We continue helping our people and people in need. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=956.04s)]
*  And we continue distributing food and and and medicine. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=959.8000000000001s)]
*  And we barely could get any sleep. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Alexander, thank you for this. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=966.44s)]
*  I hope things have changed differently the next time we speak. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=971.24s)]
*  Alexander Prokhorenko, we appreciate what you're doing. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=974.7600000000001s)]
*  The world does see you and you do have our respect. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=978.0400000000001s)]
*  Poland is not just taking refugees from Ukraine in this nation is offering those refugees housing, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=982.44s)]
*  money and medical care. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=988.2s)]
*  And for the children coming here from Ukraine, Poland is offering schooling. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=989.8800000000001s)]
*  And with that, a sense of normalcy. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=993.72s)]
*  OK, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=997.32s)]
*  Class is in session. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1000.2800000000001s)]
*  These are Ukrainian students learning Polish. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1004.7600000000001s)]
*  A lesson that you can see belies just how quickly these high schoolers have had to grow up [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1007.72s)]
*  since fleeing their home country weeks ago. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1013.48s)]
*  I just miss messages so much. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1015.8000000000001s)]
*  If you were my friend, you would just you would have to see my 100 messages about how I went to my home. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1017.6400000000001s)]
*  Miss my city because it was stopped. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1026.8400000000001s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1030.1200000000001s)]
*  I need to wait two months before I go back home. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1031.64s)]
*  It's destroyed. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1033.72s)]
*  It destroyed all my city. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1034.68s)]
*  It's I was in home when when bomb passed in the house near mine. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1036.44s)]
*  I just saw it's noise and it's so crazy and strange. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1043.88s)]
*  By contrast, the routine of school is a welcome relief. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1049.4s)]
*  I like this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1053.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1053.64s)]
*  Thank you to all people that help from gym class to the lunch room. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1054.3600000000001s)]
*  New friendships are forming. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1063.48s)]
*  Sometimes the presence is is the most that we can give and the most important thing that they [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1064.8400000000001s)]
*  that they get from us because they need it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1075.0s)]
*  They left their families in Ukraine. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1077.96s)]
*  So every every way of help is needed is much needed. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  They need friends. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  They want to talk. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1091.48s)]
*  They want to integrate with us and feel like normal teenagers. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1092.52s)]
*  And the city wants them to feel welcome to on every Warsaw lamp post are Ukrainian flags. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1097.24s)]
*  Welcoming them here. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1103.3999999999999s)]
*  Warsaw is a city of about one point seven six million people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1104.84s)]
*  Recent estimates are that about 300,000 refugees have come to this city. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1108.04s)]
*  That's a 17 percent increase in the population. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1112.84s)]
*  About half of those refugees are children. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1115.56s)]
*  So despite all the social services that are being offered to these refugees, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1117.96s)]
*  local officials say it's not enough. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1121.24s)]
*  You told me that the Polish students are doing a great job. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1124.04s)]
*  The the parents of the students are doing a great job and the people in the community [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1127.16s)]
*  are helping you a lot. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1130.92s)]
*  Still, you say you need more. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1132.28s)]
*  We have to provide apartments for these kids because some of them are sleeping in a room [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1135.64s)]
*  with 10 or 20 people on the mattress. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1142.28s)]
*  We need more financing to give them breakfasts and to give them dinners. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1146.44s)]
*  If the number of kids in Poland grow and schools grow by one fold, it's a huge burden. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1153.72s)]
*  Poland is not such a wealthy country to take care of it by ourselves. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1162.68s)]
*  Andrzej Wieroszemski is the school's headmaster. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1168.52s)]
*  He tells me he thinks the other EU countries need to step up to help Poland financially. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1171.64s)]
*  And in Poland, there's a lot to finance. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1177.3200000000002s)]
*  Here, huge lines are seen each day as refugees line up for a government ID number. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1181.3200000000002s)]
*  Like a social security number in the United States, it guarantees them the right to work, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1186.92s)]
*  free health care and education. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1191.88s)]
*  And for the students receiving that education, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1194.2s)]
*  while starting in Polish school may feel like starting over, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1196.68s)]
*  they don't intend to let the challenge hold them back. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1200.44s)]
*  If you want to learn, you will learn. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1202.76s)]
*  If you don't want to learn it, you don't learn it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1204.28s)]
*  I will not say that I won't learn Polish, but I know that it's important for me and I need to learn it. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJY2oRIBAc&t=1206.6000000000001s)]
