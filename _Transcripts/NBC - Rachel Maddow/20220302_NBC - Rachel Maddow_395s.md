# Poor Planning, Low Morale, Weak Supplies Corrode Russian Invasion From Within
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA)
*  And as Russian forces push forward deeper into Ukraine today, capturing the city of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=0.0s)]
*  Kursan, as we mentioned, and encircling other key strategic cities like Mariupol, we're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=4.28s)]
*  also getting reports from the battlefield of Russian troops abandoning their vehicles [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=8.92s)]
*  without a fight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=13.36s)]
*  In fact, the New York Times put it this way. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=14.36s)]
*  They're reporting that some Russian soldiers, plagued with poor morale, lack of fuel and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=16.2s)]
*  food have, quote, surrendered en masse or sabotaged their own vehicles to avoid fighting. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=19.84s)]
*  Now, those reports appear to confirm pictures and videos posted online by Ukrainians across [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=25.84s)]
*  the country showing abandoned Russian military hardware. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=30.4s)]
*  With reliable battlefield information often hard to come by, as you can imagine, by one [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=34.96s)]
*  of the people that has proved most adept at examining this user-generated content and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=39.1s)]
*  proving context on what we are seeing is Rob Lee. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  He's an expert on Russian defense policy and Russian military hardware. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=46.76s)]
*  Rob Lee is a former Marine Corps infantry officer who is also a senior fellow at the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=51.04s)]
*  Foreign Policy Research Institute. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=55.64s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=59.68s)]
*  Rob, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=60.68s)]
*  What's your impression after seeing this New York Times report based on U.S. intel that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=63.04s)]
*  entire units of Russian troops are abandoning their vehicles, laying down their weapons [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  rather than fighting in Ukraine? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=72.64s)]
*  Does that comport with some of the reporting and user-generated content you are able to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=74.64s)]
*  see online? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=78.88s)]
*  Yes, I think it confirms what we're seeing online. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=81.28s)]
*  A lot of the videos, many of the Russian soldiers who were surrendering or being captured, a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=84.28s)]
*  common theme is just saying they didn't know they were going to war. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=89.28s)]
*  So they were deployed, they thought they were doing a training exercise. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=92.2s)]
*  It's clear many of them were not told they were going to war until maybe a day or two [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  prior. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=98.84s)]
*  And so it's really bewildering for them because I don't think many of them know what the purpose [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=99.84s)]
*  of this war is and maybe they've never seen a task, but they don't know why they're there [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=103.04s)]
*  in many cases. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=106.84s)]
*  In many cases, the civilian resistance we're seeing is something that's also quite surprising. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=108.04s)]
*  And so I think in many cases, they're being told to move into Ukraine. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=112.8s)]
*  The planning isn't that clear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=116.68s)]
*  And in a lot of cases, we're seeing abandoned vehicles and vehicles that appear to be in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=118.56s)]
*  working order and yet they're still being abandoned in large numbers, which indicates [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=122.08s)]
*  that this is something that might be deliberate or there are significant morale issues that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=125.92s)]
*  basically confirmed by the New York Times report of what we're seeing from open sources. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=132.28s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen this, but US officials today, they said that Russia has put a large [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=137.2s)]
*  number of rank and file soldiers on the ground in Ukraine by some estimates, as many as 70 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=140.84s)]
*  percent of those that were committed along the border. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=146.28s)]
*  But perhaps with inadequate resources, you know, they are yet to control the space, the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=148.92s)]
*  airspace over Ukraine entirely. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=154.88s)]
*  Are you surprised by what we have seen thus far in terms of how Russia is executing this war? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=156.76s)]
*  Yes, there are a number of surprising aspects. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=164.32s)]
*  One thing that I thought was when Russia started this war, I thought they're going to maximally [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  employ their use of fires, of aviation, of airstrikes, all those things to grade Ukraine's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=172.4s)]
*  defensive capabilities, to try and knock out the Ukrainian Air Force, to knock out their [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  air defense systems, all those things I thought they were going to achieve. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=181.44s)]
*  I thought they're going to use electronic warfare, very heavyweights, and knock out [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=184.28s)]
*  communications in Kyiv. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=186.72s)]
*  And we haven't really seen that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=187.72s)]
*  And it's been quite surprising. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  It appears they're adapting at this point. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=190.72s)]
*  It appears that when they went in, that they had an overly optimistic goal or idea of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=192.64s)]
*  what was going to happen. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think they thought they were going to get this much resistance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  And it includes many of these cities that they've taken so far, moved into, are the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=200.72s)]
*  more pro-Russian areas, or the Russian-speaking areas, and they're still seeing a significant [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  amount of resistance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  And so it is, I think, quite surprising to them of what they're seeing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's clear that the initial goal was to try to get to Kyiv as quickly as possible [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=214.2s)]
*  with light forces. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=218.44s)]
*  They did that aerosol operation at an airport outside Kyiv on the first day. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=219.44s)]
*  That failed, and now they're moving into Plan B. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=223.12s)]
*  But it's not completely clear to me how they're going to translate military force into achieving [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=225.4s)]
*  long-term political goals. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=230.28s)]
*  And it seems as though the goals they have are unrealistic to be achieved through military [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=231.52s)]
*  force. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=235.92s)]
*  You also probably saw that Russia today announced that 500 of its soldiers have died in this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=236.92s)]
*  conflict so far. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=241.4s)]
*  Two Western officials tell NBC News today that it's probably closer to around 6,000 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=243.76s)]
*  that have been killed in Ukraine so far. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  That is a significant number of losses in one week. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  If true, that means more Russian troops have died in Ukraine in seven days than U.S. troops [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  did in Afghanistan in 20 years, and almost the same number of Russians who died in Chechnya [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=260.24s)]
*  during that war. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=264.0s)]
*  What do you make of those conflicting reports? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=265.0s)]
*  So, you know, even if we accept the Russian figure, right, about 500 KIA and about 1,500 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=267.48s)]
*  in action, those are unprecedented numbers for the Russian military under Putin's leadership, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=274.08s)]
*  right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=279.04s)]
*  So in Chechnya, Russia lost more than 3,000 soldiers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=280.04s)]
*  That was over many, many years. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=282.24s)]
*  It wasn't under such a confined time period. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=283.6s)]
*  In Georgia, Russia lost fewer than 100 soldiers, and that was over five days. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=286.04s)]
*  In the Donbass in 2014, 2015, Russia probably lost a couple hundred, two to three hundred. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=290.4s)]
*  And then in Syria, they've only lost a couple hundred over a long-term campaign, too. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=294.92s)]
*  So even if the 500 KIA figure is accurate, that is still substantially more over a short [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=298.6s)]
*  period of time than Russia has suffered at any time these other wars Putin has fought. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  And if we're talking about, you know, 6,000, that really is an astounding figure. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=308.12s)]
*  And again, it comes back to, did Russia expect they would sustain these kind of losses? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure they did. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  But if it's on the higher end, that really is significant. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  And one of the big problems and one of the things that's unique about this war is that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=321.88s)]
*  When you compare it to the Iraq war, the Bush administration made a year-long mobilization campaign. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  They tried to mobilize public support in support of the war. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=331.6s)]
*  Putin didn't do that this time, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=334.72s)]
*  And they kept denying they were going to war up until a few days prior. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=336.04s)]
*  And so because the Russian government did not mobilize the public, there's a bit of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=339.44s)]
*  a question of if this war drags on and casualties increase, what is the public backlash? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=342.8s)]
*  And I think that's a real question. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=348.16s)]
*  I don't really know, but I think over the next few weeks, with the economic disruptions, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  that could become a significant factor. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's very possible that President Putin will be facing possibly the greatest [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=355.12s)]
*  domestic threat to his time in office in the last 10 years or maybe his entire time he's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=359.44s)]
*  been in office. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=364.44s)]

*  Thank you so much for your analysis. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=372.52s)]
*  I greatly appreciate it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=373.52s)]
*  Learned a lot. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXV-cwbQDA&t=374.52s)]
