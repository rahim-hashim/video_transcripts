# Criminal Investigation Of Trump In Georgia Continues With Special Grand Jury Approved
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU)
*  Joining us now is Michael J. Moore. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=2.84s)]
*  He has tried cases in front of the judge who will oversee the special grand jury process [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=5.22s)]
*  in Fulton County. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=8.56s)]
*  Mr. Moore, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=9.56s)]
*  Thanks for making time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=11.44s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=12.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=14.56s)]
*  It does seem like this approval from the courts to seat the special grand jury, it came fairly [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=16.22s)]
*  quickly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  We were just reporting last week on the request to the courts made by District Attorney Willis. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  They've responded already. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=27.76s)]
*  I understand that means that they had to essentially poll all the judges in the county and a majority [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=29.24s)]
*  of them had to, the Superior Court judges in the county, and a majority of them had [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  to approve this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=38.36s)]
*  That approval seems to have come fairly quickly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=39.56s)]
*  That said, in terms of the timeline, this special grand jury isn't actually going to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=42.1s)]
*  be seated until the beginning of May. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  I was curious about those, the quickness with which they acted and the delay until the grand [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=48.04s)]
*  jury actually is seated. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=54.2s)]
*  Do you have any way to help us understand that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=56.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  We've got 20 Superior Court judges that sit in Fulton County, so a majority of those judges [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  would have to have approved the application to have the special grand jury. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=64.16s)]
*  That's indicated in Judge Brasher's order when he said the majority have in fact authorized [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=68.72s)]
*  this grand jury. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=73.8s)]
*  I don't put a lot of stock in the date. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=75.08s)]
*  That could be something as simple as the scheduling of the judge who will oversee this grand jury. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=78.92s)]
*  He may have a trial going on in April that's going to take the entire month and he's doing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=82.68s)]
*  pretrial in March. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=87.16s)]
*  We just don't know what that might be. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=88.48s)]
*  I don't necessarily put a lot of stock in it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=91.12s)]
*  It may also be to make sure that they get to summons us out and do those things necessary [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=93.0s)]
*  to bring in a special grand jury in this case. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know that I see it as something that puts up a red flag. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=100.68s)]
*  I will tell you that I think it's interesting under the special grand jury statute though [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=104.36s)]
*  that a lot of authority is given to the judge that oversees the special grand jury. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=108.48s)]
*  The statute actually provides, if you read a little further down, it actually says that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  it's until a report is issued or until the judge who is overseeing the grand jury decides [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=118.72s)]
*  that they're through. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=123.56s)]
*  You have to question at some point, may there be some decision made there? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=125.36s)]
*  At that point, he makes a report back to the chief judge who then has to tell the other [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  judges and it kind of goes through a review at that point and they can ask that other [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=132.16s)]
*  work be done and other witnesses be questioned, those kinds of things, very specific. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=138.16s)]
*  But it does vest a good deal of power in the judge that oversees the case. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=142.36s)]
*  I know that you have tried cases, or at least I've been told that you have tried cases in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=148.24s)]
*  front of the judge who is going to have that supervisory role here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=152.12s)]
*  Is there anything that we should know about the judge and his reputation and his capabilities, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  how he's viewed by his peers? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  You know, I've had cases where he's been the judge. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  I've not tried a case in front of him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=164.52s)]
*  I think he's a good judge. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=167.36s)]
*  He's a thorough judge. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=169.12s)]
*  But, you know, he's a Republican appointee and I don't say that as if it's some kind [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=170.52s)]
*  of bad mark against him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=175.16s)]
*  But I mean, that's just the reality of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=177.0s)]
*  And so I think he'll be thorough and I think he has probably a good understanding based [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=179.28s)]
*  on his time as an assistant U.S. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=183.8s)]
*  attorney, you know, in what cases look like, where they're complex. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=185.56s)]
*  But there's also, you know, U.S. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  attorneys are also taught that you look for the most severe, readily approvable offense [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=192.16s)]
*  that you can have when you're moving forward with a case. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=197.56s)]
*  And that's one thing I've really been pushing for here, and that is I don't know that we [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=200.48s)]
*  need a special grand jury. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=204.36s)]
*  I mean, we've got the secretary of state has written a book about what happened, so it's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=206.04s)]
*  not really a secret about what went on. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=210.24s)]
*  Plus, we have this recorded telephone call. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=212.44s)]
*  You know, it's not exactly I know he's secretary. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=214.72s)]
*  Ravensberger has said he's not going to come without a sum, but you know, it's not exactly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=217.44s)]
*  a profile encouraged to sell a book, but then refuse to come forward to a grand jury who's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=220.32s)]
*  trying to look into the allegations that you wrote your book about. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, that being said, I think in this case, you know, the district attorney [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  could take a very rifle shot approach at the case. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=232.36s)]
*  And that serves a lot of, you know, there's a lot of benefit to that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=237.56s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, moves the case quickly. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, it avoids some problems that may come down the road with appellate [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  courts in this state that are controlled by, you know, Republican appointees, some friends [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=247.52s)]
*  of mine and some good people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=252.48s)]
*  And I'm not suggesting that that means the case goes one way or another. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, if you if you have a doubt about how things might come out, I mean, tell [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  me how things are going at the U.S. Supreme Court now, you know, based on who's got the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=261.88s)]
*  majority in the court. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  So, you know, those are things to consider. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  I also think it would be smart because, you know, think about the benefit of a sniper [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=270.52s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=274.32s)]
*  You do a quick shot, you know, you kind of are hidden in the bushes and you've got the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=275.32s)]
*  opposed to driving up to the enemy camp in a school bus and giving them a big target [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  to shoot at. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=283.88s)]
*  So it's just different approaches. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=284.88s)]
*  And I certainly have a lot of respect for the district attorney and don't want to second [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=286.84s)]
*  guess her. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=289.76s)]
*  I certainly don't want to be calling shots from the from the cheap seats here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=290.76s)]
*  But I do think there's a case to be made for treating this like any other criminal case. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, slap the Trump indictment if you choose to indict him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=298.96s)]
*  Just put him in front of a regular criminal grand jury, you know, slap him in between [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  a somebody accused of sexual assault and somebody accused of fraud. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=305.92s)]
*  That seems probably a pretty good place to have his hit his case heard and see if the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=309.68s)]
*  grand jury wants to issue an indictment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=314.48s)]
*  They're not there to listen to all the evidence. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=316.04s)]
*  You don't have to put all of your case forward. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=318.74s)]
*  You don't have to present your case beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  You're just establishing probable cause. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=323.6s)]
*  So would the citizens of Fulton County make a decision based on testimony that a prosecutor [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  felt like was enough to establish probable cause that a crime had been committed? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=331.04s)]
*  They then issue an indictment and move the case forward to trial. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=335.56s)]
*  So I think there's some considerations that could still be looked at. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=338.68s)]
*  My guess is that she's doing this to maybe expand her investigation, to look at other [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=346.48s)]
*  She might be looking at people that were involved in the telephone call, the scheduling or other [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=347.48s)]
*  people who made calls to the state officials as well. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=352.14000000000004s)]
*  But I do think there's a way to move the case a great deal more quickly and with some efficiency [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=355.6s)]
*  that might might help as well. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiV1t1o_kIU&t=362.56s)]
