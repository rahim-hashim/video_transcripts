# New Developments Reported In Criminal Probe Of Donald Trump In Georgia; Subpoenas Planned
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc)
*  What I know about investigations is they're kind of like peeling back an onion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=0.0s)]
*  And as you go through each layer, you learn different things. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=5.2s)]
*  To be a responsible prosecutor, you must look at all of those things in investigation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=7.8s)]
*  To be fair to everyone involved, this is a very important matter, as you've already [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=12.36s)]
*  highlighted. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=16.88s)]
*  And so, yes, the investigation seems that it will go past just this one phone call that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=17.96s)]
*  we've discussed and that you played for your viewers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=23.6s)]
*  That was Georgia State Prosecutor, the District Attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, Fonny [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=26.96s)]
*  Willis, speaking on this show last year. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=31.92s)]
*  We had that interview with her here just days after she announced that her office had opened [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=34.68s)]
*  a criminal investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 election [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=38.96s)]
*  results. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  She told us in that clip that it went beyond Trump's direct phone call to the Georgia [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Secretary of State, telling him that he needed to find a specific number of votes so that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=49.540000000000006s)]
*  he could be declared the winner of the state. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=53.92s)]
*  She said that it was like peeling an onion and they would be looking at everything related [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  to those efforts to interfere with Georgia's election results. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=61.04s)]
*  Well, it's been a little over 14 months since Fonny Willis's office began that investigation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=64.44s)]
*  Today, we're learning more about where it stands and where things are headed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=69.64s)]
*  You might remember that earlier this year, a panel of Georgia judges cleared the way [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=72.72s)]
*  for a special grand jury to be seated in this case to look at potential criminal charges [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=76.32s)]
*  against former President Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=80.84s)]
*  Well, today, in a new interview in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, District Attorney Willis [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=82.36s)]
*  has confirmed something of a timeline for that special grand jury. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=86.86s)]
*  She says she expects the grand jury will be seated starting May 2nd, and they'll start [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=90.5s)]
*  hearing from witnesses as of June 1st. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=95.14s)]
*  In today's interview, she also notes for the first time that her investigation has already [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=98.1s)]
*  taken voluntary testimony from at least 50 people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=101.5s)]
*  She told the paper today that with the grand jury being seated now, she plans to seek [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=106.3s)]
*  subpoenas for an additional 30 other people at least. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=110.22s)]
*  Of course, part of the special grand jury's job will be to sign off on subpoenas for folks [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=115.22s)]
*  who won't voluntarily testify but will once they are compelled to by the grand jury. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=119.58s)]
*  But then come June 1st, that grand jury is expected to start hearing from all the witnesses [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=124.86s)]
*  themselves. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=128.82s)]
*  So all of that is new and notable. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=129.82s)]
*  I will tell you, there's one other piece of that interview with the AJC that stood out [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=131.82s)]
*  for me today. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=135.74s)]
*  Fonny Willis and her team have faced threats from very early on ever since they first announced [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=137.74s)]
*  this investigation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=143.86s)]
*  That's one of the things we first talked to her about in February 2021. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=144.86s)]
*  She was very candid about the threats that had come in to her and to her office since [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=148.46s)]
*  the investigation had been announced. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=152.02s)]
*  But in this latest interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she pointedly, quote, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=154.18s)]
*  declined to name the lead prosecutor she has assigned to the probe, citing security precautions. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=158.1s)]
*  She also told the paper that she has recently ordered bulletproof vests for her prosecutors [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=164.3s)]
*  who are working on this case. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=169.5s)]
*  Obviously that is bracing to hear, but more than ever, it appears that this investigation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  is full steam ahead. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=176.9s)]
*  Now we have a bit of a timeline for it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=179.38s)]
*  Tick tock. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEbfWq_MRc&t=181.1s)]
