Video Description: An MSNBC prime time panel discusses the argument made by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that making the president above any criminal accountability for crimes they may commit in office presents a greater risk of mushrooming criminal activity in the White House than the "chilling effect" that concerns Donald Trump's legal team and their sympathetic justices.

# Justice Jackson raises a red flag on the idea of a president with no legal liability
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M)
*  These are not the kinds of activities that I think any of us would think a president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=0.0s)]
*  needs to engage in in order to fulfill his Article 2 duties. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=6.38s)]
*  And particularly in a case like this one, as applied to this case, the president has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=11.1s)]
*  no functions with respect to the certification of the winner of the presidential election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=16.54s)]
*  The states conduct the elections, they send electors to certify who won those elections [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=23.14s)]
*  and to provide votes, and then Congress in an extraordinary joint session certifies the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=30.94s)]
*  vote. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=36.1s)]
*  And the president doesn't have an official role in that proceeding. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=37.1s)]
*  So it's difficult for me to understand how there could be a serious constitutional question [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  about saying you can't use fraud to defeat that function, you can't obstruct it through [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  deception, you can't deprive millions of voters of their right to have their vote counted [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=52.14s)]
*  for the candidate who they chose. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=57.78s)]
*  Thank you, counsel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=59.86s)]
*  Thank you, counsel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=61.9s)]
*  Welcome back to our primetime recap of today's Supreme Court proceedings on whether President [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=63.3s)]
*  Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for actions he took as president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=67.66s)]
*  It is also our primetime recap of the first full day of testimony from the blockbuster [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=72.26s)]
*  lead witness in the criminal trial of that same former president, which is ongoing right [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=77.14s)]
*  now in New York. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=82.4s)]
*  We still have New York to get to. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=84.34s)]
*  But on that point from the Supreme Court arguments today, that discussion at the top there from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=86.9s)]
*  Michael Dreeben, lawyer for the special counsel's office that has brought the federal prosecution [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=91.5s)]
*  against Trump for trying to stay in office after he lost the election, Dreeben is engaging [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=96.06s)]
*  there with the question of what counts as an official act by a president versus what's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=100.52s)]
*  an unofficial act by a president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=106.12s)]
*  The reason he was engaging with that is because the conservative justices today, as Katie [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=109.36s)]
*  Fang who was there just was telling us, the conservative justices today kept putting that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  forward as the most important thing to be derived from today's argument, the next thing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=117.02s)]
*  they wanted to do, the next step they wanted to take in this case, not incidentally a time [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=123.36s)]
*  consuming started all over kind of step that would have the practical effect of making [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=128.64s)]
*  absolutely sure that there's no chance Donald Trump stands trial before the election. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=133.67999999999998s)]
*  That is what the Trump side wants. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=139.88s)]
*  That seems to be what the hardline conservatives on the Supreme Court want as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=141.48s)]
*  But while those conservative justices today were demanding that lawyers for both sides [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  dance on the head of this particularly stupid pin, the more liberal justices did use today's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=153.0s)]
*  proceedings to try to spell out what is just bluntly wrong with that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=159.18s)]
*  What seems crazy to normal people about the broadest strokes of what Trump is trying to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=164.1s)]
*  do here? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=170.66s)]
*  If there's no criminal, if there's no threat of criminal prosecution, what prevents the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=171.66s)]
*  president from just doing whatever he wants? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  All the structural checks that are identified in Fitzgerald and a whole series of his court's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=179.38s)]
*  cases that go back to Martin against Mott, for example, impeachment, oversight by Congress, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  public oversight, there's a long series that Fitzgerald directly addresses this in the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=188.06s)]
*  civil context and we think that language naturally ports to criminal justice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=191.7s)]
*  I'm not sure that that's much of a backstop and what I'm, I guess, more worried about, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=194.82s)]
*  you seem to be worried about the president being chilled. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=200.5s)]
*  I think that we would have a really significant opposite problem if the president wasn't chilled. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=203.3s)]
*  If someone with those kinds of powers, the most powerful person in the world with the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=209.18s)]
*  greatest amount of authority could go into office knowing that there would be no potential [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=216.08s)]
*  penalty for committing crimes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=222.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm trying to understand what the disincentive is from turning the Oval Office into the seat [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=225.56s)]
*  of criminal activity in this country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=233.52s)]
*  I don't think there's any allegation of that in this case and what George Washington said [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=235.88s)]
*  is, what Benjamin Franklin said is, we view the prosecution of a chief executive as something [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  that everybody cried out against us unconstitutional and what George Washington said is, we're [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=243.68s)]
*  worried about factional strife which will... [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=247.68s)]
*  No, I'm also, let me put this worry on the table. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=250.96s)]
*  If the potential for criminal liability is taken off the table, wouldn't there be a significant [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=254.16s)]
*  risk that future presidents would be emboldened to commit crimes with abandon while they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=259.32s)]
*  in office? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  It's right now the fact that we're having this debate because the OLC has said that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=267.12s)]
*  presidents might be prosecuted. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=272.24s)]
*  Presidents from the beginning of time have understood that that's a possibility. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=275.2s)]
*  That might be what has kept this office from turning into the kind of crime center that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=279.28s)]
*  I'm envisioning. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=284.88s)]
*  But once we say, no criminal liability, Mr. President, you can do whatever you want, I'm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=285.88s)]
*  worried that we would have a worse problem than the problem of the president feeling [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  constrained to follow the law while he's in office. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=296.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=301.32s)]
*  Let me put this worry on the table. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=305.08s)]
*  She says, Justice Katanji Brown Jackson today speaking plainly, taking a step back to see [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=307.44s)]
*  the larger picture today. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=312.48s)]
*  You keep saying how terrible it would be if the president was put on trial for his crimes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=314.36s)]
*  Can we also talk about how terrible his crimes would be and how terrible it would be for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=318.52s)]
*  the presidency and for the country going forward if all future presidents knew they can commit [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=324.2s)]
*  any crime they want and there's nothing anyone can do about it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=329.12s)]
*  Chris Hayes, I was worried your head was going to fall. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=334.44s)]
*  Well, because I had the same experience listening to our arguments. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=336.92s)]
*  I was like, yes, yes, yes, exactly. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=340.52s)]
*  And partly it's because Sauer, Trump's lawyer, and Trump himself, and some of the conservative [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=342.24s)]
*  justices all seem to be agreeing on what we call the dirty, hairy model of the American [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=347.8s)]
*  presidency, which is like, you've got to be tough and maybe you've got to break some legs [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=352.16s)]
*  Maybe you've got to shoot some bad guys and like, what are you going to do? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  Bring your lawyers against me? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=359.47999999999996s)]
*  Like that was a consistent theme today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=361.0s)]
*  They kept saying, Sauer kept saying like bold and decisive action. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=363.84s)]
*  And one of the things Katanji Brown Jackson brought up, which was another highlight of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=367.28s)]
*  hers, which sort of pairs with that point. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=370.24s)]
*  She's like, bro, there's lots of people with tough jobs out there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=371.88s)]
*  Governors, there's the people that run the Pentagon. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=375.12s)]
*  They all might face criminal prosecution. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=378.0s)]
*  Somehow they managed to do their jobs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=380.64s)]
*  And actually, isn't it probably good that like they're going to do something and they [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=382.4s)]
*  go to their lawyer, they'll be like, well, I get thrown in jail for this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=385.96s)]
*  But that seems like a good check. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=388.28s)]
*  And I had to say, like, I was listening to that as someone who came up as a reporter [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=389.88s)]
*  in Illinois where like four of 11 governors went to prison. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=392.28s)]
*  It was good that you might go end up in jail if, for instance, you sold commercial driver's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=396.44s)]
*  licenses for bribes, as a former governor did when he was secretary of state. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=403.34s)]
*  Like those were official acts. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  But yeah, that sort of Damocles hanging over your head, probably a useful restraint when [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  wielding great power. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=414.06s)]
*  Can I just talk about the first clip that you played, the idea that as what did Sauer [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=415.8s)]
*  say, the official stuff has to be expunged. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=421.24s)]
*  We need to have a separation here between the private acts and the official acts. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=423.72s)]
*  A, I think it's quite clearly a delay tactic. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=427.56s)]
*  But B, it does have me worried if this is the most likely outcome here, that this remanded [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  back to the district court and this whole new series of tests arises about what part [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  of this is official, what part of it is private. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=438.2s)]
*  I do worry about the integrity of the case that the prosecution's put forward here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  They sort of articulated that in court today, too. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=444.6s)]
*  Dreybin from the prosecution basically says this is an integrated conspiracy here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=447.72s)]
*  It has different components. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=453.16s)]
*  And you know, it's Donald Trump working with private lawyers to achieve the goals of the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=455.32s)]
*  fraud. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=460.44s)]
*  Once you start to unwind that arbitrarily, I guess, if the district court must, into [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=461.56s)]
*  separating private and official conduct, assuming any of it is official, I do worry about what [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=466.16s)]
*  that means for the case writ large. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  And it slows it down for sure, and it may kill it altogether. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=475.4s)]
*  Well, and like if Lawrence is right, and there's a very likely possibility that Joe Biden wins [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=477.4s)]
*  and this ends up going to trial, you do have to think about, OK, what actually is the meaningful [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=482.64s)]
*  impact of this if it does see a court? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=488.56s)]
*  And also, don't we have to at some point answer the question that was asked? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=490.56s)]
*  And that's what Katanji Brown Jackson and Justice Jackson kept saying. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=494.4s)]
*  Shouldn't we actually answer the question, does a president have blanket immunity? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=497.4s)]
*  They seemed they were going all around trying not to answer it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=502.36s)]
*  But we actually need the answer to it, because to your point, Rachel, now that we've given [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=505.48s)]
*  the theoreticals of a coup, killing your opponent, bribery, treason, murder, now that we've put [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=509.72s)]
*  it on the table where Trump can hear it, where he can see it and find it, don't we need to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=516.2s)]
*  know just in case he becomes president whether he can kill people? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  Because he now knows that in theory, he's got four or five people on the court who think [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=524.44s)]
*  maybe he can. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  And the argument about that today was, well, we'll carve out an area of private acts only. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=530.52s)]
*  And those ones, and those ones they can be prosecuted for eventually someday. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=536.16s)]
*  But it's going to be an elaborate test. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=541.36s)]
*  We're going to have to go back to the beginning of it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=542.72s)]
*  And don't forget, you have to do impeachment and conviction before you can get to criminal [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=544.4s)]
*  prosecution. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=549.64s)]
*  Which has never happened in the history of the United States. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=550.64s)]
*  Ergo, the reason why they're creating even more of a higher, more impossible bar, it's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=552.36s)]
*  not just put it there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=556.04s)]
*  That's a non-starter, Joy. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=557.28s)]
*  You mentioned you're not a lawyer. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=558.28s)]
*  But you sound like a good lawyer. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=559.8399999999999s)]
*  Because that's what happens at the Supreme Court. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=562.16s)]
*  There's a question presented. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=564.8s)]
*  And it says, to what extent does a former president have presidential immunity from [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=565.92s)]
*  criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=571.4799999999999s)]
*  Now that word alleged is doing a lot of work. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=576.64s)]
*  This question was already written. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=580.16s)]
*  It was the first clue. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  Andrew Weissman and others mentioned this when we saw it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  It was the first clue they were leaning towards Trump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=584.12s)]
*  If you can allege your way, meaning it's not really an official act, you just allege it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=586.88s)]
*  Well, anyone can allege anything. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=591.72s)]
*  If you watch the news or follow the law, I'm sure you've heard about that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=593.48s)]
*  What we're doing here is testing the evidence. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  There's been overwhelming evidence, which is why Jack Smith got this far. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=599.32s)]
*  It's why he won this case at the district level. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=602.84s)]
*  It's why he won it at the D.C. circuit unanimously in a bipartisan set of appointees. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  The evidence has already been established to some degree. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=609.84s)]
*  It doesn't mean Trump's guilty, but it means we're past that point. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=612.0s)]
*  If anyone can allege their way around, then this question and the test that the conservatives [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=614.62s)]
*  are pushing won't protect America. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=620.58s)]
*  How do you separate it? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=622.38s)]
*  Giving out pardons is an official act the president is allowed to do. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=623.54s)]
*  It's an Article 2 power. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=626.7s)]
*  But if he sells the pardon and takes a bribe for the pardon, is it an official act? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=627.7s)]
*  The bribe part is private, but the pardon is not. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=632.22s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=636.34s)]
*  You have to take a holistic view of the integrated forms of behavior. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=639.26s)]
*  This isn't splitting the baby, it's splitting the knife. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN1d7F-At7M&t=643.02s)]
