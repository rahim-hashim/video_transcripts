Video Description: Rachel Maddow shares AP reporting on a list of forbidden material that the Department of Defense under Donald Trump intends to delete in furtherance of eliminating diversity and inclusion in the federal government. As with other deletions under Trump's second term, whoever was responsible for this one did not take into consideration that banning the word "gay" would also result in eliminating the history of the Enola Gay.

# Clumsy execution turns a bad idea into another humiliation for Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY)
*  You know, sometimes people say, you can't make it up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is one of those, you can't make it up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=3.64s)]
*  In fact, I tried to make this up at one point. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=5.44s)]
*  It wasn't this good. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=10.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=11.84s)]
*  This is Paul Tibbets. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=12.84s)]
*  He retired from the United States military as a brigadier general. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=13.84s)]
*  He was a pilot in the United States Air Force during World War II. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=16.52s)]
*  Here's another shot of him poking his head out of his plane window. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  And that plane, it had a name. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=24.92s)]
*  You see it painted there in black, Enola Gay. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=26.28s)]
*  Paul Tibbets actually named the plane himself. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=29.2s)]
*  He named it after his mom, whose name was Enola Gay. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=31.8s)]
*  And that plane is probably the most famous plane in American military history because [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=35.84s)]
*  Paul Tibbets piloted the Enola Gay when it, of course, dropped the world's first atomic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=39.9s)]
*  bomb on Hiroshima. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=46.0s)]
*  These days, the Enola Gay is on permanent display at the Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=50.2s)]
*  Virginia. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=55.36s)]
*  Enola Gay, a piece of bold-faced American history. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=56.36s)]
*  Today the Associated Press published this database. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  It's basically a list that was compiled by the Trump administration of more than 26,000 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=67.32s)]
*  photographs and websites that are on file with the U.S. Department of Defense. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=73.4s)]
*  And the reason the AP published this database is because, according to their reporting, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=79.08s)]
*  the Trump administration plans to wholesale delete all the 26,000 photos and websites [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=83.8s)]
*  that are listed in this Pentagon database. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=91.0s)]
*  All 26,000 things here, the Trump administration wants all of these things scrubbed from the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=94.2s)]
*  Internet entirely. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=99.52s)]
*  And included in that database, marked for deletion by Donald Trump, is this photo of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=101.92s)]
*  Paul Tibbets and the Enola Gay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=108.62s)]
*  This photo from the United States Air Force website. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=112.0s)]
*  And that's curious, right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=115.8s)]
*  I mean, it is the most famous plane in modern history. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=116.8s)]
*  Why would the Defense Department want to scrub that photo from the Internet? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=122.1s)]
*  It's not like deleting this photo is going to make people forget that we dropped that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=125.36s)]
*  nuclear bomb on Japan. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=128.62s)]
*  The tens of thousands of Department of Defense website images have been flagged for removal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=134.24s)]
*  due to having content that highlighted diversity, equity, or inclusion. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=138.58s)]
*  They searched the whole Defense Department website for the word gay and then ordered [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=146.78s)]
*  all the gay to be deleted. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=156.84s)]
*  And I mean, substantively, it's confusing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  This is like the straightest thing I've ever seen, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a giant metal machine from the 1940s. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=165.64s)]
*  But maybe because he named it after his mom, does that mean he's sensitive? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  Does that make it kind of gay? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  Also, you know, you delete the photo of the gay plane, but then what? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Do you have to also destroy the actual plane? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=178.44s)]
*  Set it on fire, drop a bomb on it, although uh-oh, using a bomb to destroy the plane that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  dropped the first atomic bomb, that might be seen as kind of poetic. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=187.27999999999997s)]
*  And that is definitely gay. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=190.44s)]
*  I should mention it's not only the photo of the gay plane. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=194.36s)]
*  This is Sergeant Major A.C. Gay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  His photo has also been flagged to be deleted by the Defense Department because his name [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=202.68s)]
*  is gay. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  This is, it's like that time that right wing website in the mid 2000s, he's decided they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=212.4s)]
*  were going to change all the mentions of gay and all their news stories to be homosexual [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  instead. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=222.36s)]
*  We talked about this a few weeks ago. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=223.36s)]
*  The American sprinter Tyson Gay was in the news and on this right wing website they changed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  all their stories about Tyson Gay to be instead about Tyson homosexual. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  Tyson homosexual easily won his semi-final for the 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic track [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  and field trials. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=238.52s)]
*  Except now it's not some fringy conservative website. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  It is the U.S. Defense Department. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  We should send somebody to Chantilly to go check on poor Enola homosexual. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=248.68s)]
*  See if she's doing okay. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=255.4s)]
*  Your tax dollars at work everybody. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=258.04s)]
*  Make an America gay. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=260.88s)]
*  Make an America gay. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Never mind. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ90aLXmbVY&t=264.84000000000003s)]
