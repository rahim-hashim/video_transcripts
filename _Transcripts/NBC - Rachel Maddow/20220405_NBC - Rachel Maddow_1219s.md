# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 4
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU)
*  Joining us now is Tumas Ilves. He is the former president of Estonia. He also served as the former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=0.0s)]
*  Estonian ambassador to the United States and to Canada. Mr. President, thank you for being with us tonight. For the immediate future, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=5.64s)]
*  and we're talking about days or weeks now, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=12.52s)]
*  what do you think the response from the West should be to Russia? Is it more sanctions? Is it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=15.48s)]
*  Europe saying we're shutting off the gas and oil flow? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=21.88s)]
*  Specifically, what would you like to see done in the days to come? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=26.04s)]
*  Well, the most pressing matter, of course, is shutting off the money supply to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=30.32s)]
*  to the Russians. And that really, I mean, they're getting several billion a week from [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=36.6s)]
*  from selling gas primarily to three countries, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=42.4s)]
*  Germany, Austria and Hungary. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  So that that would be the toughest blow where we see other activities, however, which is equally, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=49.08s)]
*  I think, forceful is, for example, open [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=56.16s)]
*  intelligence, open source intelligence, identifying the troops who were in place today when the Russians [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=59.64s)]
*  basically push back and saying this was this was all made up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  Now, the New York Times has just published old aerial photography of the bodies lying there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=71.8s)]
*  So the Russians are being consistently embarrassed by their own propaganda failures. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=77.24s)]
*  You understand this well, having been the president of Estonia and having been the ambassador to the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=83.36s)]
*  United States and Canada. What is surprising about what you just mentioned is the conspiracy theory, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=89.16s)]
*  the pushback by Russia about how the Ukrainians themselves may have killed those people [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=95.56s)]
*  and planted their bodies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=101.28s)]
*  It gets into the American conspiracy theory far right echo chamber as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=103.28s)]
*  There are Americans saying, well, how do you really know that the Russians killed these people? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=110.24s)]
*  How do you really know those are atrocities? Maybe it's just propaganda. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=115.68s)]
*  Well, we saw this already in 2014 when the Russians shot down the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=120.48s)]
*  MH17 Malaysian airliner where they made all kinds of claims that, well, actually the plane had been [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=126.16s)]
*  filled beforehand with corpses by CIA. No one bought that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=132.24s)]
*  No serious people bought that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=137.36s)]
*  And now, too, when you keep coming up with evidence as the Times just published with old [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  or rather three week old aerial pictures of bodies lying in the street, then once again, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=149.28s)]
*  that has been debunked. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is always a problem we have to face is that people will come up with wild, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  wide eyed conspiracy theories. And then it unfortunately becomes the task of the truth [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=163.12s)]
*  tellers to push back on those kinds of wild conspiracies. And in this case, it's quite clear [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=169.52s)]
*  the Russians really blew it with their claims. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  So at this point, a few days ago, just a few days ago, we had seen the conversations between [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=181.84s)]
*  the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine. They continued via teleconference. There was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=186.64s)]
*  real optimism about possible peace talks or even discussions from the Russians about a meeting [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=191.6s)]
*  between Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. Is there a diplomatic path forward here? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=195.92s)]
*  Well, I think the discovery of massive war crimes makes it very difficult politically for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=203.92s)]
*  for President Zelensky to give away too much in discussions. I think that this is so completely [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  horrified, not only the Ukrainian public, but the rest of the West, that the pressures he was under [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=222.64s)]
*  until just a few days ago to make concessions have, I think, lightened considerably and for [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=231.04s)]
*  himself. I mean, let's face it, the difference between Ukraine and Russia, the fundamental [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  difference is that Ukraine has a democratically elected president and he has to, he can't do [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=243.12s)]
*  things the way Putin can. I mean, he has a free press and if he's going to make concessions, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  his public will get very angry. His electorate will get very angry. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=257.76s)]
*  And certainly after all of these horrific pictures and this evidence of what has been going on, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=264.72s)]
*  and moreover seems to have been going on in other cities and towns in Ukraine as well, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=272.48s)]
*  it will make the peace process far more difficult than it has been up till now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=278.0s)]
*  Timos Ilves is the former president of Estonia, former Estonian ambassador to the United States [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=284.4s)]
*  and to Canada. Thank you so much for your time tonight. Well, thank you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=289.2s)]
*  This 255-foot luxury yacht's name is Tango. It's currently docked on the Spanish island of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=295.76s)]
*  Mallorca. It's estimated to cost a whopping $90 million. It's staffed by a crew of 22 people [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=302.4s)]
*  and equipped with cabins for 14 guests, a swimming pool and a beauty salon. Tango belongs to the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=308.64s)]
*  Russian oligarch Victor Vexelberg. He's a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, or we actually should say [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=314.8s)]
*  Tango did belong to Victor Vexelberg until early this morning when it was seized by the FBI [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=321.12s)]
*  and Spanish authorities. Prosecutors in Spain obtained a court order allowing U.S. authorities [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=327.04s)]
*  to swoop in and take control of the ship. Now, this is not the first seizure of an oligarch's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=332.32s)]
*  yacht. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a whole barrage of mega yachts have been seized [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=337.04s)]
*  in exclusive marinas all across Europe. But this yacht seizure is notable because it's the first [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=342.0s)]
*  by U.S. officials. Today's operation was coordinated by the Justice Department's new [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=348.8s)]
*  KleptoCapture Task Force, which is an interagency law enforcement group aimed at holding sanctioned [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=354.32s)]
*  Russians accountable. And today, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, made it clear this is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=360.96s)]
*  just the beginning. Today marks our task force's first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=365.52s)]
*  individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last. Together with our [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=373.28s)]
*  international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=386.56s)]
*  While President Biden himself has admitted these measures will not change the tide of this war, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=391.52s)]
*  they certainly chip away at the pillars of Vladimir Putin's support. Joining us now to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=395.84s)]
*  discuss what she witnessed and what the world should do about it is Ukrainian Member of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=402.08s)]
*  Parliament Kira Rudik. Ms. Rudik, thank you for being with us tonight. We appreciate it. You have [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  often taken time to be with us, and it's hard, and it's the middle of the night, but it is harder [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=410.88s)]
*  tonight somehow. Somehow, even though you have been there for a long time, you've been there [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=415.84s)]
*  even though you have been out there with your phone documenting this war since the beginning, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=420.64s)]
*  something more has happened now. Tell us what the world should know about what you saw. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=424.8s)]
*  Hello, Ali. Thank you so much for having me. I have seen so many dead bodies today. I have seen [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=431.12s)]
*  people killed by with their hands tied behind their backs, and I talked to people who survived [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  this, who have seen all of this with their own eyes. I have talked to women who were raped by [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=446.88s)]
*  Russians who had their children watch it and their husbands killed. I have talked to people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=454.08s)]
*  whose children were dying of pneumonia because they had to stay in the basement for 39 days without [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=463.6s)]
*  any ray of light. I have seen and talked to families whose relatives died and were burned [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=470.56s)]
*  alive. We talked to families whose daughters were the ones who were burned by Russians and ran over [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=479.2s)]
*  tanks. We have seen so much pain and destruction there that I cannot even begin to tell you, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=488.64s)]
*  but the most important was what happened was that we were able to get international journalists [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=495.68s)]
*  into VUCA so they could film it themselves and share the information with the whole world. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=501.76s)]
*  Because what we witness right now is that Russia is already trying to say some obscene things, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=507.68s)]
*  that it is all made up and it is not. We are gathering the evidence because every single [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=513.12s)]
*  person will have and will be taken accountable, will be prosecuted, and will be held to justice. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=519.6s)]
*  I have seen people whose houses were destroyed to the ground, and you know, like the most broken [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  piece was the house that burned down and with only fence staying up. And on that fence there was a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  sign written by hand put into the plastic file and tied to the fence with the tape, you know. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=547.68s)]
*  And it was saying on this sign, we are peaceful people. So people wrote that hopefully that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  Russians will admit them, that they will avoid death, but they did not. But they were in fact [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  peaceful people. They were not even resistance. They did not bear arms. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=572.08s)]
*  They just wanted to survive this war and they did not. And for that we will demand justice. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  We will never forget and we will never forgive. There will be trials. There will be lists of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=585.36s)]
*  soldiers that we are putting together so they will be held accountable. And we want right now [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  every single world leader to think twice if they are doing enough because we think they are not [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=596.24s)]
*  doing it. Because right now at the same time when we are talking there are people somewhere in the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=602.64s)]
*  basements. There are people being killed with their hands behind their back. There are people being [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=607.76s)]
*  raped because there are places that are occupied by Russians still. And we are not getting the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=612.48s)]
*  weapons that we need to get. Because on the day 40 we are talking about the same things that we need [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  on the day one. Because right now on the day 40 there are still countries that are buying Russian [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=626.56s)]
*  gas and oil who are basically sponsoring those horrors and terrors that are happening to my people. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  Because right now there are still countries who are hesitating about to help Ukraine or not. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  And I can tell you this is happening right now on everybody's behalf. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  On everybody's. I want you to see this because this is happening in my country to my people, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=650.56s)]
*  to my nation. This is pure genocide. And we do need help to stop this. We do need help to win this war. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  We do need the whole world to stand up as one. To stop hesitating, to stop thinking of what to do [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=664.3199999999999s)]
*  and start acting. Start acting because this needs to stop. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=670.8s)]
*  When you say start acting, there are people concerned that anything that feels like direct [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=674.88s)]
*  military intervention, including no-fly zones or Western NATO troops in Ukraine, will be an [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=683.52s)]
*  escalation that could result in nuclear war. What do you tell those people? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=692.56s)]
*  Ali, we are not asking for NATO troops on our grounds. We are fighting Russians on the ground [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=698.0s)]
*  very well ourselves. We do need weapons and we do need sanctions on Russian gas and oil. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=703.44s)]
*  We do need weapons to fight them in the air because what you have shown right now, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  the pictures they are showing what happens to the houses, to the cities when they are attacked by [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=715.2s)]
*  missiles. We need weapons to protect our skies. We will protect them ourselves. But please [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  give us these weapons, rent us these weapons, sell them to us for one dollar or whatever. But [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=728.32s)]
*  we need them. Otherwise, we will be fighting on the ground but we will still destroy it from the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  air. And the second point that needs to happen is absolute ban on Russian gas and oil. Every single [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=740.88s)]
*  dollar that's getting into Russia is being used to create this terror in Ukraine. Every single dollar [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=748.08s)]
*  that is coming from businesses that are operating in Russia is being used to rape women here, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=756.72s)]
*  to kill children here, to kill innocent people who didn't do anything wrong, who just exist [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=764.72s)]
*  and make Putin hate us for that. This is genocide and this is happening in the 21st century. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=773.2s)]
*  And when the world was saying never again, I am calling right now for everybody who was saying [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=780.48s)]
*  never again to act on it right now. Kira Rudek, we have been speaking for a long time [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=785.52s)]
*  and you have had great force in your arguments and your videos and the fact that you have learned to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=795.6s)]
*  use a gun that you have never done before. But something is different tonight. Something is [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=801.04s)]
*  different in your voice and in the matters that you saw in Buccia and that you are bearing witness [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=805.36s)]
*  to. And we are thankful to you that you have taken the time to share that with us tonight as horrible [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=810.48s)]
*  and horrible as it is. Kira Rudek is a member of the Ukrainian parliament. Please stay safe. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=814.88s)]
*  Thank you and glory to Ukraine. Joining me now is Ona Hathaway, professor of international law [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=821.04s)]
*  at Yale Law School and the founder and director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  Professor Hathaway, thank you for being with us. Is there any way to actually charge Vladimir Putin [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=832.8s)]
*  or anyone else in the Russian chain of command with war crimes? Yes, probably the main way forward [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=839.84s)]
*  here at the moment is through the International Criminal Court. So as you mentioned, the International [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=848.1600000000001s)]
*  Criminal Court does have jurisdiction here and that is because Ukraine gave it jurisdiction [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=853.52s)]
*  starting in 2013 over all the events that are happening in Ukraine and it still has jurisdiction [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  today. And in fact, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has already begun [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=865.68s)]
*  investigations supported by referrals from 41 countries who have basically said, we really [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  support this effort, many of them offering additional money and support and assistance [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=875.68s)]
*  for that investigation. So those investigations have already begun and there's a number of steps [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=880.4s)]
*  here. There has to be evidence collection that is actually documenting the crimes that are taking [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=886.7199999999999s)]
*  place and ensuring that we collect that evidence in a way that it can eventually be presented in a [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=891.92s)]
*  court. And then there's the next step of figuring out who is responsible for these terrible crimes [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=897.52s)]
*  and connecting the acts and the terrible events to the people who actually are responsible for them. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about the facets that you talk about of international law. Is it possible to create a [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=911.52s)]
*  tribunal about this that Russia isn't part of? Russia doesn't have buy-in to the International [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=918.88s)]
*  Criminal Court and this isn't the week or the month or the year that it's going to decide to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=924.24s)]
*  change its mind. So is there an enforcement mechanism? Yeah, so that's a great question. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=927.92s)]
*  And the reason that the International Criminal Court does have jurisdiction over Russians is [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=934.24s)]
*  because they're committing their crimes in Ukraine. So it's the same principle that if I go to London [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=939.52s)]
*  and I commit a crime there, I can be brought in front of a London court for committing a crime [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=944.88s)]
*  in London. I'm an American, but I'm still responsible for the crimes that I commit [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=950.64s)]
*  in another state's territory. Similarly here, Russia is committing a whole host of crimes, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=955.2s)]
*  war crimes, crimes against humanity, perhaps even genocide, and the crime of regression on the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=960.96s)]
*  territory of Ukraine. So Ukraine does have the right to prosecute those crimes, to do it itself, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=966.16s)]
*  or to allow an international court to prosecute those crimes. And so Ukraine has given [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=974.48s)]
*  jurisdiction over these crimes to the International Criminal Court and that's what allows it to have [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  jurisdiction over the Russians who are committing their crimes on the soil of Ukraine. And so [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  even though Russia is not party to the ICC, may not recognize it, it doesn't really matter. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=992.16s)]
*  It's still the case that the International Criminal Court can prosecute them for the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=997.36s)]
*  crimes that they're committing in Ukraine because Ukraine is the one who has the power [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1000.88s)]
*  to give the court jurisdiction. It is important to note that Joe Biden and the State Department [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1005.52s)]
*  and others are talking about the fact that there are likely war crimes committed because for decades, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1013.36s)]
*  the United States itself has either resisted or undermined institutions like the ICC or the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1017.92s)]
*  UN High Commissioner on Human Rights because of allegations that have been made against the United [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1024.0s)]
*  States and allies like Israel. Apparently the Biden administration is reviewing the U.S.'s position [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1028.96s)]
*  with respect to the International Criminal Court. This feels like a moment for America to re-engage [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  those institutions. Absolutely, and you're absolutely right that the United States has [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1041.6000000000001s)]
*  had an uneasy relationship with the International Criminal Court in particular. You may remember [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1048.08s)]
*  that under the Trump administration, we actually sanctioned members of the International Criminal [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  Court, judges and attorneys who were participating in an investigation of the United States for [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1059.6s)]
*  actions committed in Afghanistan. So we've had a very uneasy relationship with the International [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1066.32s)]
*  Criminal Court. And what this moment does present is an opportunity for the United States to think [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1071.6s)]
*  about how do we provide accountability in these situations? How can we work with the International [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1077.12s)]
*  Criminal Court? Sometimes it is the only body that is legitimately in a position to actually [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1082.64s)]
*  prosecute these crimes. And we believe in international law. We believe in the Geneva [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1089.0400000000002s)]
*  Conventions and we need a way to bring accountability for these violations. And the International [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1093.68s)]
*  Criminal Court is really the institution that is best situated to do that in addition to the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1098.8000000000002s)]
*  Ukrainian courts themselves, which as you mentioned in the outset of the segment, has already begun [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1104.3200000000002s)]
*  some investigations, in fact, thousands of cases of war crimes violations. But aside from the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1111.36s)]
*  Ukrainian courts, the International Criminal Court really is the best institution for taking these [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1116.9599999999998s)]
*  forward. And so the US is going to have to figure out how to work with it effectively and how to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1122.0s)]
*  support its efforts. We do have some unexpected and truly historic news tonight concerning Joe [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1127.1999999999998s)]
*  Biden's nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Katanji Brown Jackson. As predicted today, the Senate [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  Judiciary Committee deadlocked voting along party lines on her nomination. As expected, nearly every [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1139.68s)]
*  Republican member spent their time reiterating the same tired arguments against her confirmation [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1145.52s)]
*  that they introduced two weeks ago. But we got some big news tonight about how Judge Jackson's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1150.64s)]
*  final confirmation vote will turn out because this evening both Senators Lisa Murkowski and [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1155.44s)]
*  Mitt Romney announced that they will vote in support of Judge Jackson. They joined Senator [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1160.88s)]
*  Susan Collins, who made clear she would vote for Judge Jackson last week. All three of those [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1166.08s)]
*  Republican senators followed those announcements with votes to discharge Judge Jackson's nomination [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  to the Senate floor today. The final vote was 53 to 47. That tees up a final confirmation vote later [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1176.32s)]
*  this week, likely on Friday. And that means Judge Jackson is now firmly on track to make history [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1183.36s)]
*  as the first public defender and the first black woman to be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1189.12s)]
*  And that is some badly needed good news tonight. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUc1mrqheiU&t=1196.08s)]
