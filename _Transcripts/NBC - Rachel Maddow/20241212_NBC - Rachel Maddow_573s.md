Video Description: How much will Americans get to know about the people Donald Trump is choosing to run the U.S. government? In the absence of any real vetting the way it's supposed to go, Rachel Maddow presents a Rachel Maddow Show Public Servant Announcement to hopefully help fill that gap with a closer look at Trump's choice for homeland security secretary, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, whose state’s Covid record might seem disqualifying and whose personal stories have caused her political damage.

# Rachel Maddow on Kristi Noem: Five things to know about Trump's pick for homeland security secretary
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc)
*  So, it's time for another Rachel Maddow show public servant announcement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=0.0s)]
*  The incoming administration does not appear to be vetting the people they want to install [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=9.36s)]
*  in important jobs running the U.S. government. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=13.84s)]
*  They have tried to get around doing FBI background checks and around any of the traditional vetting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=16.6s)]
*  that is done by a normal presidential transition. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=22.52s)]
*  They have even demanded that there shouldn't be confirmation hearings in the Senate for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=25.36s)]
*  these people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=29.92s)]
*  It has been strange. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=30.92s)]
*  It's been embarrassing to them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=33.04s)]
*  It has made for all sorts of unpleasant surprises already. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  But if this really is their plan, how much will the American people get to know about [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=39.72s)]
*  who these people are that Trump wants running the U.S. government? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  How did any of them even punch their ticket to get picked for these jobs? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=47.94s)]
*  Well, in the absence of any real vetting the way it's supposed to go, we hope maybe a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=51.96s)]
*  Rachel Maddow show public servant announcement can at least help. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Today, it is Donald Trump's pick for running the massive, sprawling Department of Homeland [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=64.12s)]
*  Security. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=71.72s)]
*  In Trump's first term, first time he was president, he went through six different Homeland [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=73.44s)]
*  Security secretaries in four years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=78.92s)]
*  So, who knows how long anyone will have this job this time around? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=81.84s)]
*  This one he likes to change over a lot. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=85.82s)]
*  But his choice to start, at least, is Kristi Noem. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=88.46s)]
*  Now, a minority of people hearing that name will think, Kristi Noem, Kristi Noem, South [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=92.58s)]
*  Dakota governor. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=97.86s)]
*  A majority of people hearing that name will think, wait, didn't she shoot a dog? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=99.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=104.5s)]
*  Yes, she did. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=105.5s)]
*  More on that in a moment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  But here are five other things to know about Trump's choice for Homeland Security, a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  nominee who admittedly is most famous for shooting a defenseless puppy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=112.7s)]
*  Thing number one. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  As governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem once got a significant portion of her entire administration [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=119.66s)]
*  involved in the project of getting her daughter a real estate appraisers license. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=125.94s)]
*  Kristi Noem's 26 year old daughter failed twice in her efforts to obtain a license to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=133.02s)]
*  be a real estate appraiser. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=138.94s)]
*  In South Dakota, that's all you get. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=140.82s)]
*  You only get two chances and then you're out. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=143.14s)]
*  Unless apparently your mother is the governor. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=145.62s)]
*  When Kristi Noem's daughter flunked out from the licensing process, Noem told the head [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=148.7s)]
*  of the licensing agency to come to the governor's mansion for a meeting with her and her daughter. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=153.22s)]
*  The meeting also included the state labor secretary and at least one lawyer for the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=159.9s)]
*  state labor department and Kristi Noem's own chief counsel to the governor's office [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=164.54s)]
*  and her governor's chief of staff all summoned to the governor's mansion to meet with the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=169.54000000000002s)]
*  governor herself and the governor's daughter. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  To talk about the daughter failing the licensing thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=178.3s)]
*  And wouldn't you know it, somehow at that meeting a path was discovered to offer the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=181.46s)]
*  governor's daughter an extra chance at getting her license, an unprecedented third chance [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=186.22000000000003s)]
*  that nobody else gets. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=191.74s)]
*  Soon thereafter, Noem's administration forced out the head of the licensing agency, who [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=194.5s)]
*  had had the temerity to flunk the governor's daughter in the first place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=199.18s)]
*  And we know all of this because the Republican legislature in the state launched an investigation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=203.86s)]
*  and then they unanimously approved a report from that investigation finding that Kristi [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=208.46s)]
*  Noem's daughter got preferential treatment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=213.82s)]
*  That's thing number one. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=217.34s)]
*  Thing number two. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=219.02s)]
*  Under Kristi Noem's leadership, South Dakota achieved this distinction in its management [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=220.74s)]
*  of the COVID crisis. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=225.38s)]
*  Headline, quote, as bad as it gets anywhere in the world. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=227.1s)]
*  As meatpacking plants in her home state were host to some of the largest single outbreaks [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=233.14s)]
*  of COVID anywhere in the world, Governor Kristi Noem insisted that it was just a coincidence [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=237.14s)]
*  that more than a thousand infected people all worked in the same meat plant. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=242.54s)]
*  She insisted that no new rules, no new procedures were needed to keep people safe. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=247.46s)]
*  South Dakota hosts nearly a half million people for the Sturgis motorcycle rally in 2020 and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=253.38s)]
*  hundreds of thousands more people the following month at the South Dakota State Fair. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  By the month after that, South Dakota had one of the worst COVID infection rates in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=264.46s)]
*  the whole world and its hospitals were rationing care to try to save their sickest patients. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=268.26s)]
*  Under Kristi Noem's leadership, South Dakota sunk to the worst per capita COVID death rate [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=275.42s)]
*  in the United States and among the worst in the entire world. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=281.3s)]
*  That's thing number two. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  Thing number three. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=287.74s)]
*  In the same book where she bragged about killing her puppy, Kristi Noem also wrote this, quote, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=289.1s)]
*  I remember when I met with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=299.42s)]
*  Quote, I'd been a children's pastor after all. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=307.54s)]
*  And that is very cute. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=311.94s)]
*  That is also totally made up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=313.38s)]
*  Kristi Noem never met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, let alone stared him down or, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=314.94s)]
*  you know, helped him pick Bible verses or whatever. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=321.86s)]
*  I don't know. Didn't happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  When asked for details of this supposed meeting, Kristi Noem's spokesperson said the book [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=326.58000000000004s)]
*  contained a couple of small errors that would be corrected in future editions of the book. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=331.1s)]
*  All right. Thing number four. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=339.26000000000005s)]
*  In the spring of 2024, just a few weeks before the I'm a Puppy Killer book came out, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  Kristi Noem did something strange involving a Texas dentist. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=346.86s)]
*  As the sitting governor of a real US state, Governor Noem posted on all her social media [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=351.5s)]
*  accounts a big long infomercial about her fantastic experience with a particular cosmetic [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=358.34s)]
*  dentist in Texas. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  It was nearly five minutes of the governor speaking straight to camera about this particular [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=367.85999999999996s)]
*  dentist and how great this dentist was interspersed with all these many, many, many extreme closeups [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=372.02s)]
*  of her mouth. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  Governor Noem never disclosed if she was paid for this infomercial or maybe if she got the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=380.73999999999995s)]
*  dental work for free or at a discount in exchange for doing this big endorsement. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=386.34s)]
*  She also never explained to the poor beleaguered dentists of South Dakota why she left the state [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  to get her dental work done in Texas instead. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=396.34s)]
*  At least one lawsuit was filed against Governor Noem for not disclosing whether she was a paid [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=399.7s)]
*  endorser for this Texas dentist. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  But again, this all happened while she was a sitting governor. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=408.73999999999995s)]
*  Imagine all the dentistry she might be able to get done if she were Homeland Security Secretary. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=412.82s)]
*  And finally, thing number five, about the dog. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  The thing to know about the dog is that there's also a goat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=425.7s)]
*  In her most recent autobiography, I have to mention that because she's written two, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=431.22s)]
*  Christine Noem wrote that she shot and killed her dog because she was mad at it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=436.66s)]
*  After explaining in detail how she shot and killed that 14-month-old puppy, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=441.38s)]
*  she then apparently decided she needed to kill something else right away. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=445.62s)]
*  That same day, she went and got the family's goat. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=450.5s)]
*  This is after killing the dog. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=454.42s)]
*  She went and got their goat and then she tied the goat to a pole and she shot the goat as well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=456.26s)]
*  In fact, she says effectively that she missed with the first shot so the goat was injured [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=461.38s)]
*  but not killed. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=467.14s)]
*  Then she left it tied up there and injured to go get more ammunition. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=468.18s)]
*  Eventually came back, reloaded and shot the goat again until it too was dead. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=472.41999999999996s)]
*  Her puppy and her goat in the same gravel pit shot on the same day by Christine Noem. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  And while she thought that was an awesome story that would help to propel her to national fame, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=484.41999999999996s)]
*  and that's why she should definitely put it in the book, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=489.46s)]
*  even Donald Trump was reportedly so repulsed by the story. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump famously does not like dogs, but he was reportedly so grossed out by the story that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=496.98s)]
*  it may have cost her her spot on the shortlist to be his vice presidential running mate. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=502.42s)]
*  He's not so repulsed that she can't be in the cabinet, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=508.82s)]
*  still nominating her for homeland security, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=511.38s)]
*  but he's repulsed enough that she couldn't be on the ticket with him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=513.7s)]
*  So bottom line, if at some point America ends up staring down the barrel of J.D. Vance ascending [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=518.5s)]
*  from vice president to president, there's a case to be made that might rightfully be considered [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=524.02s)]
*  cricket the puppy's revenge on America. Or maybe it's the goat's revenge. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=530.26s)]
*  Kind of seems more like something a goat would do. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=535.62s)]
*  But there you have it. Five things you need to know about your potential new [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=539.86s)]
*  secretary of homeland security, Christine Noem. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=543.9399999999999s)]
*  This has been a Rachel Maddow Show public servant announcement. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sedx7rkSOMc&t=546.8199999999999s)]
