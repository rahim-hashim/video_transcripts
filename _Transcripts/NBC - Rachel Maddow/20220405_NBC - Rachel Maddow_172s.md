# Ivanka's 'Adult In The Room' Self-Image Risks Implicating Her Father In Bad Behavior
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4)
*  Joining us now is NBC News justice reporter Ryan Reilly who first broke the news that Ivanka Trump would be testifying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=0.0s)]
*  Before the January 6th investigation today Ryan good to see you [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Tell me what you make of the idea that Ivanka Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=10.6s)]
*  According to Benny Thompson who has no reason to lie to us about this is neither invoking executive privilege [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=14.24s)]
*  Nor the Fifth Amendment. Do you make anything of that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=19.8s)]
*  You know, I think it fits into this broader theme that we saw throughout the Trump administration where Ivanka Trump and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Kushner tried to make themselves out to be the reasonable people in the room and they kept saying that they were trying to push Trump in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=30.12s)]
*  The right direction it became a trope throughout the Trump administration where we saw this in every decision that the Trump administration [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=36.0s)]
*  Made that was unpopular with the broader masses or may have been unpopular in their circles [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  There was always this story that said well, you know Ivanka was trying to push him in the right direction behind the scenes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=46.8s)]
*  So this sort of seems like an ongoing theme here because January 6th is now this monumental event that is shaping the entire Trump presidency [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=52.36s)]
*  I think it's clear here that she recognizes that she has to make clear that you know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=60.0s)]
*  She was the reasonable voice in the room and she has to get that narrative out there or else [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=64.52s)]
*  It's gonna bring her entire brand down along with her father's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=68.16s)]
*  So I tell me how she does that without throwing him under the bus because the argument that I'm the adult in the room means [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=73.92s)]
*  That someone else wasn't being an adult in the room and the the binary [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Observation that would be that maybe Ivanka Trump was trying to get him to call it off and Donald Trump wasn't calling it off [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=84.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's difficult to imagine that Ivanka Trump actually believed the things about the stolen election that her father believed, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=91.0s)]
*  I mean just generationally. She's younger. She's more internet savvy. She's college educated, you know [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=97.72s)]
*  She's probably a lot less conservative than her father [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  So it's tough to imagine that we're in a situation here where she actually believed these lies that the president was spreading which is what makes her [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  Testimony so so important because a critical thing here is whether or not Donald Trump actually believed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=113.2s)]
*  Lies that he was telling about the stolen election [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  That's really a critical component of this especially for the Justice Department investigation where that's going to be a critical component to broader [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=121.52s)]
*  To the broader investigation and criminal culpability ultimately if he actually believed the lies about the stolen election [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=129.4s)]
*  That's a lot different from just saying these things to try to make a splash and change the direction [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=135.76s)]
*  Of the and basically essentially steal the election if he knew they were lies [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=141.6s)]
*  That's one thing if you actually believe the lies that's another that could determine the trajectory of the criminal side of this investigation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnVMFcQne4&t=145.48s)]
