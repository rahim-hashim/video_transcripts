# Hundreds of protests planned as Trump's abuses generate wide array of grievances
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34)
*  It's Friday night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=0.0s)]
*  Feels like it, right? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  That said, may I suggest that you go to bed kind of early, hydrate, eat your Wheaties [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=4.44s)]
*  in the morning, maybe put off the Friday night cocktail to make it a Saturday night cocktail [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=10.64s)]
*  this week, if at all? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=15.72s)]
*  I'm only saying that because tomorrow is going to be very busy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=17.64s)]
*  Saturday is going to be very busy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=21.0s)]
*  I said at the top of the show there are more than 1,200 protests planned for tomorrow in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=22.76s)]
*  all 50 states. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=27.98s)]
*  If I stand corrected, it is more than 1,300 protests planned in more than in all 50 states. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=28.98s)]
*  It's expected to be the largest single day of protest since Donald Trump took office. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=38.06s)]
*  Joining us now is Ezra Levin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=44.18s)]
*  He's co-founder of Indivisible, which is one of the groups that is promoting these [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=45.18s)]
*  events tomorrow. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=49.14s)]
*  Ezra, thanks very much for joining us tonight. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=50.14s)]
*  You were here just a couple of three weeks ago talking about the earliest idea for April [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=51.7s)]
*  5th being sort of a hub for events all over the country and in Washington. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=58.94s)]
*  How has the organizing gone? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=63.58s)]
*  What has the response been compared to what you expected? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  Gosh, Rachel, it's been incredible. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=68.06s)]
*  Can I just say it has been incredible? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=70.06s)]
*  We knew when we announced three weeks ago on the show that this was going to be the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=72.42s)]
*  week where we saw an election in Wisconsin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=77.86s)]
*  We were cautiously optimistic about that election in Wisconsin for this Supreme Court. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=80.66s)]
*  We didn't know we were going to kick Elon Musk's butt all across the state, but we [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=84.78s)]
*  were cautiously optimistic. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=88.86s)]
*  We also didn't know that Cory Booker was going to give this incredible speech, inspiring [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=90.54s)]
*  all of us and telling us that he was taking a stand in response to pushes from his own [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  constituents. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=99.06s)]
*  We also didn't know that Donald Trump was going to launch a global attack on the economies [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=100.38s)]
*  of not just not our economy, but the global economy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=105.14s)]
*  This confluence of events, this sense that they are overreaching so much and there is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=109.58s)]
*  a possibility to fight back and win is leading to this just incredible response. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=116.3s)]
*  As you said, more than 1,300 events every single state. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=121.02s)]
*  Yes, there are over 100 events in California. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=124.66s)]
*  There are more than 60 in the state of New York, more than 50 in Washington, but it's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=128.1s)]
*  not just blue states, Rachel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=131.38s)]
*  We see 17 events across the state of Montana, 14 across Alaska. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=133.38s)]
*  This is everywhere. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=138.22s)]
*  We're not just talking about one event in every state. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=139.22s)]
*  We're talking about multiple, sometimes dozens of events, and these are normal, everyday [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=142.22s)]
*  people who are saying, hey, I've had enough. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=146.66s)]
*  I've seen institutions fall. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=150.14s)]
*  I've seen the universities. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=151.78s)]
*  I've seen businesses. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=153.1s)]
*  I've seen law firms not stand up, not support our liberal democracy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=154.86s)]
*  So what am I going to do as an individual? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=159.5s)]
*  Well, I'm going to do my part. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=161.06s)]
*  I'm going to show up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=162.74s)]
*  That's what tomorrow is about. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=163.74s)]
*  Gosh, Rachel, it is inspiring to see so many people hop on board this train. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  The theme under which this is sort of loosely organized is hands off. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=169.46s)]
*  I've seen people use all sorts of different types of phrasing around the different types [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=174.26000000000002s)]
*  of protests that they're going to be part of, and it seems like it's lots of different [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  groups who are organizing, and in some cases, it's no groups. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=181.9s)]
*  It's just individual people who are coming out with their friends and neighbors. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  But it seems like the hands off messaging is the most overarching phrase that we're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  going to hear tomorrow, the most overarching idea, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=192.02s)]
*  One of the beautiful things about this is it's meeting people where they are. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=195.3s)]
*  We are all coming to this for a different reason. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=200.34s)]
*  We can say hands off the Department of Education, hands off our Social Security, hands off our [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=203.06s)]
*  Medicaid, hands off trans kids, hands off our communities, hands off our civil rights, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  hands off our democracy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=212.58s)]
*  Different things are bringing different people to this fight. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=214.66000000000003s)]
*  That's good. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=217.78s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=218.66000000000003s)]
*  We can all come together and say no, and that's what we're going to see tomorrow. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=219.94000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=224.02s)]
*  Popular front. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=225.3s)]
*  Very, very, very, very, very big tent. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=226.5s)]
*  If for some reason you don't like what Donald Trump is doing to the country, there's a very [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=229.22000000000003s)]
*  large tent that is open to you, and people are going to be showing it in a very vivid [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=233.3s)]
*  way tomorrow. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=238.02s)]
*  Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, thank you very much, sir. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=241.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVcbjWqj34&t=249.86s)]
