Video Description: Republican Senate candidate for Ohio, Bernie Moreno, who is running against popular Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, was caught on camera at a campaign stop making the argument that "a lot of suburban women" are single issue voters who only care about abortion rights, and that women who take that position are crazy, especially women over the age of 50, for whom, he argues, reproductive rights are not an issue.

**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI)
*  I mentioned before the break that we just got in something sort of shocking from a U.S. Senate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=0.0s)]
*  candidate, a Republican candidate. This is coming from Ohio. In Ohio, the Democratic incumbent [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=7.26s)]
*  senator is, of course, Senator Sherrod Brown. He's running for reelection. Republicans have [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=12.5s)]
*  nominated a wealthy car dealer to try to unseat Sherrod Brown. The Republican candidate is named [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=16.86s)]
*  Bernie Marino. And we just got in this tape of Bernie Marino at a campaign event in Lebanon, Ohio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=22.46s)]
*  Oh, thank God my wife didn't hear that one. A little crazy, by the way, but especially for women that are like past 50. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=52.46s)]
*  I'm thinking to myself, I don't think that's an issue for you. That tape just in from Lebanon, Ohio, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=70.54s)]
*  Republican Senate candidate Bernie Marino saying any woman over 50 doesn't have any reason to support [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=78.78s)]
*  reproductive rights, abortion rights. You kidding? Because, you know, women over 50. I'm thinking to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=84.98s)]
*  myself, he actually says it. I'm thinking to myself, I don't think that's an issue for you. Wow. You know, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=93.02s)]
*  unluckily for Bernie Marino in Ohio running against Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, women in Ohio, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  even women over 50 apparently do still have the right to vote, even if he doesn't think they have a right to an [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=106.7s)]
*  opinion. Good luck, sir. Amazing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UqnRIvXzrI&t=114.02s)]
