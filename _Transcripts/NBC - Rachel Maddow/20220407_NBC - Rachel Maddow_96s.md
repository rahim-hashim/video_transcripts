*  Shortly before announcing Katanji Brown Jackson's historic confirmation vote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris did something that was rather unexpected. Take a look at this. You can see on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=4.32s)]
*  the left-hand side of your screen, she pulled out a few pieces of paper. It turns out that was [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  vice presidential stationary, and she proceeded to hand it over to the only two black Democrats in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=13.6s)]
*  the Senate, Senators Cory Booker and Raphael Warnock. Apparently, the vice president told them she had [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=19.6s)]
*  an assignment. She wanted each of them to write a letter to a young black woman in their life as a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=25.36s)]
*  way of commemorating this date in history. Senator Raphael Warnock has shared the letter that he [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=30.96s)]
*  wrote. It is addressed to his daughter Chloe, and it reads, Today we confirmed Katanji Brown Jackson [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=36.0s)]
*  to the United States Supreme Court. In our nation's history, she is the first Supreme Court Justice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=42.0s)]
*  who looks like you, with hair like yours. While we were voting on the floor of the Senate, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=47.92s)]
*  a friend of mine, the vice president of the United States, handed me this piece of paper and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=52.96s)]
*  suggested I write a letter to someone who comes to mind. By the way, she is the first vice president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=57.92s)]
*  who also looks like you. So I wrote this note to say you can be anything, achieve anything you set [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=64.32s)]
*  your head and your heart to do. Love you, Dad. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXejz4KA4fU&t=70.88s)]
