# Report on Trump's private remarks reveals true stakes of 2024 election
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q)
*  This morning, heading into what we knew would be two big important court hearings on these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump cases today in federal court in Georgia and federal court in D.C., reporter Alan Feuer [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=5.22s)]
*  wrote a scene-setting piece about those two court hearings today for the New York Times, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=11.24s)]
*  for the morning paper this morning, sort of reminding us all where this may be heading. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=15.52s)]
*  He said towards the end of his article this morning, quote, the timetables for Mr. Trump's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=20.1s)]
*  four trials have taken on outsize importance. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=23.96s)]
*  That's not only because there are so many of them, but also because they're unfolding [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=27.24s)]
*  against Trump's crowded calendar as the candidate leading the field for the Republican Party's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=30.32s)]
*  2024 presidential nomination. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=34.76s)]
*  As a further complication, Trump has made no secret in private conversations with his [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=36.86s)]
*  aides of his desire to solve his jumble of legal problems by winning the election. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=42.36s)]
*  Quote, if either of the two federal trials he's confronting is delayed until after the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  election and Trump prevails in that election, he could seek to pardon himself after taking [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=55.44s)]
*  office or he could have his attorney general simply dismiss the matters altogether. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=60.32s)]
*  And I know that learning that Trump has been saying that privately to his staffers is not [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=65.52s)]
*  shocking news per se, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=71.56s)]
*  We've known that was probably what he was planning, probably what he was thinking. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=73.52s)]
*  But per the New York Times, it does seem sort of significant that that's what he's now telling [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=77.16s)]
*  people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=81.48s)]
*  That's what he's telling people he's going to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=82.82s)]
*  He will solve his jumble of legal problems by winning the election. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=84.92s)]
*  And you know, whatever you think about that, that's how he's thinking about that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=91.56s)]
*  And what does that say about the election for all of the rest of us? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=98.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=102.68s)]
*  It means in his own mind and those of his campaign and his supporters, presumably, these [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=103.68s)]
*  are the stakes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=109.08s)]
*  And again, whatever you think about that as a legal strategy for Trump, that is how he [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=110.08s)]
*  is thinking about the election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=114.68s)]
*  And that is how he is going to be talking to his supporters and his aides and his campaign [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  about the stakes of the election. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=120.64s)]
*  The election means one of two things. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=122.92s)]
*  If this is the way he's going to approach it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=125.9s)]
*  Either he loses the election and he goes to prison or he wins the election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  He doesn't go to prison. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=134.36s)]
*  And is that for life that he gets to be president? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=136.8s)]
*  Will we keep having more elections or no? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=140.4s)]
*  If every election is a new opportunity for him to go to prison, do you think he allows [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=144.28s)]
*  us to have new elections? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=147.76s)]
*  I mean, if those are the stakes, if winning the election is his plan to stay out of prison, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=149.08s)]
*  what happens in that election if and when he does not win it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=154.64s)]
*  Does that kind of an election end with a graceful concession to a fair and square reelected [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=159.56s)]
*  President Biden? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=163.76s)]
*  I mean, if Trump and his supporters see the stakes as losing and going to prison or winning [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=164.76s)]
*  president and probably president for life, how should we expect that he and the Republican [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=171.2s)]
*  Party and Republican officials in swing states are going to handle the conduct of that election [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  that Trump may very well lose? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=181.72s)]
*  And because we are prone to forget, we have to say out loud that we would be remiss, we [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=186.72s)]
*  would be willfully naive to ask that question as if our politics exists in a vacuum somewhere [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=194.52s)]
*  outside the rest of our news. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  As if the politics pages are totally different than the crime pages, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=205.52s)]
*  As if we are not in a moment where far-right politics is coincident with far-right violence, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=209.12s)]
*  with regular shows of force from paramilitary extreme right groups and with acts of violence [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=214.72s)]
*  by people who are explicitly and admittedly motivated by far-right eliminationist political [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=220.44000000000003s)]
*  ideas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=226.28s)]
*  We are prone to forget, but we do not have to forget. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=230.28s)]
*  So what should we know? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=235.08s)]
*  What can we know about what happens in far-right politics when it appears to be in nexus with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  far-far-right violence that right now is just pinging off the charts? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNzx8wwtU6Q&t=243.92s)]
