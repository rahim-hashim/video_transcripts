# Dearth Of Good Options For GOP Voters Heading Into Tuesday Primaries
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys)
*  President Trump, on behalf of all the MAGA patriots in America, I want to thank you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=0.0s)]
*  for the historic victory for white life in the Supreme Court yesterday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  The historic victory for white life in the Supreme Court yesterday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=19.76s)]
*  That was Illinois Republican Congresswoman, member of Congress, Mary Miller, at a campaign [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=24.9s)]
*  rally with former President Trump this weekend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=31.74s)]
*  Before that Saturday rally, Congresswoman Mary Miller was probably best known for telling [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=34.5s)]
*  attendees of a previous rally about what she thinks Hitler got right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  Hitler was right on what? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=45.7s)]
*  Let me stop you there, ma'am. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=46.94s)]
*  But after the stuff Hitler was right about, it's kind of faded into the background, there [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=49.52s)]
*  she was this weekend calling the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade a victory for white [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=54.88s)]
*  life. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  Now, Congresswoman Mary Miller's office put out a statement saying that moment in her [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  speech was a mistake, just a misstatement. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=63.88s)]
*  She meant to say the right to life. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=67.0s)]
*  But regardless of whether or not what she said was intentionally said or not, what she [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=69.56s)]
*  actually said out loud, very clearly, was that the Supreme Court's ruling was a victory [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  for white life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=79.1s)]
*  And then you can see her there clapping along as the crowd gave a hearty cheer for white [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=80.78s)]
*  life and as the people in the Blacks for Trump t-shirts behind them kind of didn't know what [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=87.14s)]
*  to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  The reason Trump held that rally this weekend with Congresswoman Hitler was right, Mary [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=95.41999999999999s)]
*  Miller, white life, is because tomorrow she's going to face off in a primary against one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=100.3s)]
*  of her fellow Republican members of Congress. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=106.62s)]
*  Rodney Davis, a redistricting process in their state, squeezed those two Republicans into [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  one district. And so they've got a primary tomorrow. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=115.42s)]
*  Trump is obviously supporting the Hitler was right victory for white life lady. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  Race tomorrow, we'll get to see whether or not she stays in Congress. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=123.66s)]
*  And so, therefore, that'll certainly be one to watch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  But there are primary races tomorrow in eight states altogether. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=129.82s)]
*  That one's in Illinois. There's also races in Colorado, Mississippi, Nebraska. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=136.78s)]
*  And there's frankly a bunch of doozies in a bunch of those states. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=140.26s)]
*  Colorado Republicans tomorrow, for example, are going to be choosing their candidate for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=144.62s)]
*  the top job overseeing elections across the entire state of Colorado. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=149.78s)]
*  And one of the Republican candidates in that secretary of state race is this woman, Tina [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=153.94s)]
*  Peters. Now, if that name Tina Peters sounds familiar, it's because Tina Peters keeps [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=159.26s)]
*  making national news because she is the county clerk in Colorado who is currently under [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=164.5s)]
*  indictment, charged with seven felonies and three misdemeanors after she allegedly tampered [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=169.74s)]
*  with official voting equipment and gave sensitive voter information to election conspiracy [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=175.3s)]
*  theorists who then promptly posted it all online, including all the passwords. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=180.46s)]
*  A Colorado judge has already barred Tina Peters from overseeing the 2022 elections [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=185.86s)]
*  in the county where she's the county clerk. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=192.22s)]
*  But now she is running to oversee elections for the entire state of Colorado. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=194.14s)]
*  Tina Peters, that said, is not the only that kind of candidate who's on the ballot in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=200.1s)]
*  Colorado tomorrow. One of the Republican candidates in the primary race for governor [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=204.57999999999998s)]
*  tomorrow is this man, Greg Lopez. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=210.18s)]
*  He's running on a platform in Colorado that Republican votes should count more than [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=212.22s)]
*  Democratic votes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=217.62s)]
*  Seriously, he says if he's governor, he will change Colorado's election law. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=219.62s)]
*  So votes from rural Republican leaning areas would count more. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=225.18s)]
*  They'd be worth more than votes from urban Democratic leaning cities. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=229.42s)]
*  OK. In Oklahoma tomorrow, Republicans are set to choose their candidate to replace [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=235.74s)]
*  retiring Senator James Mountain Inhofe. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  Among the dozen or so Republicans running in that race is another familiar face. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=244.22s)]
*  His name is Scott Pruitt. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=249.34s)]
*  He was head of the EPA under Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=250.9s)]
*  Remember him? He's best known for competing sort of neck and neck with Trump's interior [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=252.78s)]
*  secretary, Ryan Zinke, for the title of who could rack up the most scandals in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=257.46s)]
*  shortest tenure on Trump's cabinet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=262.7s)]
*  Scott Pruitt's list of scandals at the APA was truly jaw dropping. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=265.46s)]
*  Ran the gamut from spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on private flights and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=269.62s)]
*  tactical pants. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  What tactics do pants use? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  He allegedly used his office to try to get his wife her own Chick-fil-A franchise. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=278.86s)]
*  He also had taxpayers pay for a soundproof phone booth that he installed in his EPA [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=283.58s)]
*  administrator office for his high security, soundproof chats. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=289.94s)]
*  Now he wants to be the Republican nominee for Senate in the great state of Oklahoma. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=295.58s)]
*  So, like I said, there's a lot of races to keep an eye on tomorrow in Illinois, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=299.46s)]
*  Oklahoma, Illinois and Oklahoma. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=304.62s)]
*  Polls close at eight o'clock Eastern time tomorrow in Colorado. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  Polls are going to close at nine p.m. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=311.14s)]
*  Eastern. Watch this space. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8-Gpo6oys&t=312.41999999999996s)]
