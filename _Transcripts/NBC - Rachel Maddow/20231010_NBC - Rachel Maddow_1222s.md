# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 9
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE)
*  You and Senator Booker, as I mentioned, were both able to quickly and safely get out of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=0.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=5.76s)]
*  What do you understand about the situation in terms of Americans who may be seeking consular [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=7.04s)]
*  help and other people who are trying to leave? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=11.58s)]
*  Obviously, we just spoke with the deputy national security adviser, Mr. Feiner, about the difficulties [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=14.44s)]
*  that people in Gaza have trying to get anywhere. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=20.52s)]
*  2.3 million people packed into a narrow 25-mile-long strip of land, very, very densely packed area [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=24.96s)]
*  with no real way to leave ahead of what's now already started as the Israeli retaliation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=32.32s)]
*  Similarly, lots of Israelis want to get out of the country under very different circumstances, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Americans among them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=43.2s)]
*  What do you understand about freedom of movement, freedom of travel, and what the U.S. government [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=44.72s)]
*  is able to do to support that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=48.08s)]
*  Well, we're in regular communication with both the State Department and the administration, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=50.84s)]
*  as well as I have numerous constituents, many who went over like I did for the Sukkot holiday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=56.2s)]
*  in Israel, which is a very common time for Jews to return to Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  So we are very concerned. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=69.84s)]
*  Right now, there are very few flights going in and out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=71.26s)]
*  It appears as if El Al Airlines, the Israeli National Airlines, is just about the only [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=73.44s)]
*  one that is coming in and out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=77.2s)]
*  And we are having regular communications with the State Department because so many Americans [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=79.84s)]
*  do want to get out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=84.4s)]
*  They should reach out to the State Department or their local member of Congress. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=85.84s)]
*  You know, on the Gaza front, and I heard what Mr. Feiner said, I would add one thing that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=90.16s)]
*  I think is really important here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=96.72s)]
*  And I just saw a video from the IDF that was translated in Arabic that explained to civilian [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Gazans that there are designated evacuee places for them to go to avoid being in buildings [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=105.44s)]
*  where Hamas has its infrastructure, which are the targets of Israel's retaliation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  That is, of course, a courtesy that the 260 concertgoers and the children and grandparents [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=124.88s)]
*  in southern Israel did not get from the Hamas terrorists. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=133.04s)]
*  And I think it's a very important distinction to make here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=136.72s)]
*  Israel is notifying civilians in Gaza when they are going to attack their particular areas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=139.44s)]
*  And that is in accordance with international law, unlike what the Hamas terrorists did on Saturday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=147.04s)]
*  Israel has had so many conflicts in its 75-year history, you know, all the way back to 1948. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=154.88s)]
*  And as recently as a couple of years ago, an 11-day war in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=160.32s)]
*  And I feel like oftentimes looking at historical analogues, historical precedents can help us [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=164.16s)]
*  understand what might happen in this circumstance. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=171.04s)]
*  In this circumstance, as you're describing the specific situation in which we've got [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=173.92s)]
*  not only these mass coordinated terrorist attacks inside Israel, but the mass hostage-taking, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=179.92s)]
*  to me makes it I don't I feel like no precedent helps me understand what happens next. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=186.08s)]
*  And I don't understand what the end game is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=192.24s)]
*  And strategically for choosing to take so many people, young kids, babies, the elderly, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=194.96s)]
*  disabled people, whole families taking them hostage, I don't see how it resolves. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=201.68s)]
*  I feel like it makes it makes everything here not just more horrific, but also more unpredictable [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=207.84s)]
*  in terms of how this can sort out because nothing like this has happened before. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=214.24s)]
*  I wanted to ask if you just had a if you had a take on that or any [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=218.4s)]
*  different kind of understanding of that than I feel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=221.52s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=225.28s)]
*  This is unprecedented in Israel's history. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=226.56s)]
*  And this is not just a perpetuation of the cycle of violence that we've become. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=229.12s)]
*  Some, unfortunately, many have become somewhat numb to over the last several decades. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  This was a coordinated premeditated terrorist attack against civilians in Israel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=238.56s)]
*  that has not occurred in the in the history, 75 year history of Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=243.76s)]
*  What we are seeing and the reason why we as Americans must stand with Israel against the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=249.44s)]
*  terrorist organization Hamas is a scenario where Hamas has control of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=255.92s)]
*  But Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  This is not about Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=265.2s)]
*  This is about a terrorist organization that has exacted horrific war crimes against Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=267.36s)]
*  because their sole mission is to eradicate Israel from the face of the earth. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  And the only way to deal with a terrorist organization like Hamas is how the world dealt [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=279.68s)]
*  with terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and ISIS, because that is exactly what Hamas is. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=284.64s)]
*  Hamas needs to be eliminated from Gaza. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=290.48s)]
*  There needs to be a new government that can represent the interest of the Palestinian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=293.44s)]
*  people, which Hamas does not do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=297.68s)]
*  And so the initial mission must be to to eliminate and neutralize Hamas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=300.24s)]
*  We're going to start tonight with a story that is very much still developing, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=308.64s)]
*  very much still unresolved and very personal to our first guest. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=312.32s)]
*  This is Yair Yaakov and Mirav Tal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  They live on a kibbutz in southern Israel, a kibbutz called Nir Oz. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=319.92s)]
*  And Yair's sons are 16 and 12 years old. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=325.52s)]
*  Or is the big brother. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=330.56s)]
*  He's 16. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  Yageel is the younger son. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=332.4s)]
*  He's 12. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=334.48s)]
*  And on Saturday morning at 8 45 a.m. local time, so this is just a couple of hours after [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=336.48s)]
*  the Hamas terrorist attacks started in southern Israel, Yair got on the phone on the phone [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=342.24s)]
*  with his sister-in-law from the kibbutz. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=349.68s)]
*  And he told his sister-in-law that he and his girlfriend were in a shelter inside their [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=353.44s)]
*  house. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=358.0s)]
*  They were going to try to ride out these bombings that had just started. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=359.2s)]
*  He said his two sons, his 12 year old and his 16 year old, they were not with them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=362.24s)]
*  They were with their mother at a different house on the kibbutz. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=368.4s)]
*  And Yair said that the plan was that everybody was going to stay put until the bombings [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=371.2s)]
*  stopped. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=376.56s)]
*  And then they would find each other and get back together. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=378.08s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=381.04s)]
*  Then about a half hour later, another communication. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=383.04s)]
*  And this time it was from Yair's girlfriend. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=385.68s)]
*  It was from Mirav. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=388.24s)]
*  And she texted out an audio message. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=389.44s)]
*  And it was terrifying. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=393.12s)]
*  She said there were two terrorists inside the house. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=394.8s)]
*  They had guns. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=398.08s)]
*  They were shooting. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=398.96s)]
*  She said Yair was trying to hold back the door to the shelter so that the terrorists [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=400.24s)]
*  could not get in. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=405.12s)]
*  And that was the end of it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=406.64s)]
*  After that, they lost connection. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  So Yair's brother tried calling them back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=409.84s)]
*  He also tried that thing where you try to locate somebody's phone to try to figure [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=413.76s)]
*  out where his brother and his girlfriend were exactly. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=419.12s)]
*  He was not able to find them that way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  Later in the afternoon, he was able to get in contact with the boy's mother again. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, she had been with the two sons at a different house on the kibbutz. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  She said she had been contacted by two kidnappers who made the 16-year-old boy or get on the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=433.52s)]
*  phone and tell his mom that he had been kidnapped. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=440.08s)]
*  Then he hung up. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  So the long and the short of this is that all four of these people, Yair and his two [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  sons and Yair's girlfriend, they have now all been reported missing by Yair's brother, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=452.08s)]
*  Yanev. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=458.08s)]
*  And Yanev says the whole family has been missing as far as they know since basically [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=459.84s)]
*  midday on Saturday. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=465.36s)]
*  He has not heard from them since. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=466.4s)]
*  Except there has been an additional electronic communication of the worst kind. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=469.04s)]
*  Yanev says he has been sent a video which appears to show his brother Yair and his [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  brother's girlfriend being kidnapped on Saturday morning. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=479.6s)]
*  Since the attack on Israel started on Saturday morning, we have seen these [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=484.0s)]
*  murders and hostage takings of civilians and otherwise. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=489.28s)]
*  We have seen them being filmed and put online for a strategic aim, right, to advance the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=494.56s)]
*  purposes of the people who are doing the murdering and the hostage taking. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=501.84s)]
*  And so when it comes to the footage that these people are producing of their killing and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=505.84s)]
*  kidnapping people, that puts every social media company on earth and it puts everybody in the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=511.68s)]
*  news business in the position of potentially doing their work by showing what they are [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=517.44s)]
*  doing because they want it to be seen. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=523.6s)]
*  They want that to augment the terrorizing effect of what they are doing to these innocent [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=525.36s)]
*  people. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=532.48s)]
*  Now, on the other hand, the people whose families have been victimized in this way [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=533.5200000000001s)]
*  are in some cases asking us to please show these videos, to please show this stuff because [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=538.32s)]
*  they believe it should be, A, known that this is happening and B, because in some cases they [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=544.08s)]
*  believe it could potentially help them get their loved ones home safely. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  So being in the middle of that, not wanting to advance the cause of the people who not only did [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  these things but filmed them for a reason and the people who are saying please show the footage that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  shows the difficult situation that our family members are in, we believe it could help. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  That is a very difficult thing to reckon with. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=569.12s)]
*  All of these decisions are hard ones. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=571.76s)]
*  I don't think there is a right decision. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=574.08s)]
*  In this specific case of Yair and Mirov and the two boys, Yair's brother has asked us to show this [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=577.92s)]
*  video, which appears to depict his brother and his brother's girlfriend being abducted on Saturday. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=583.68s)]
*  So we're going to play it with no sound. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=589.28s)]
*  It was uploaded with propaganda style music. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=592.4s)]
*  We do not need to broadcast that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=594.96s)]
*  You also don't need to hear the human exclamations and fear from the people who are in this situation. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=596.88s)]
*  Even without the sound, I think it goes without saying this video is disturbing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=603.6s)]
*  It's about 30 seconds. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=608.08s)]
*  We're going to show it now. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=609.84s)]
*  Again, it does not have sound. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=610.64s)]
*  It does have sound, but rather we are not playing that sound. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=612.16s)]
*  But it's 28 seconds. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=615.6s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=618.0s)]
*  Again, this is the video that was sent to the brother of Yair, the man you saw at the end of the video there, along with his girlfriend at the first part of that video. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=626.88s)]
*  Joining us now from southern Israel is Yair's brother, Yanev Yaakov, who shared this video and photos of his family with us. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=656.64s)]
*  Mr. Yaakov, I can't imagine the anguish that you and your family are going through. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=663.04s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  I want to give you the opportunity first to correct me if I said anything wrong there or characterized anything the wrong way around. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=670.16s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=678.8s)]
*  That's the first. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=680.96s)]
*  It's a very hard situation. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=681.84s)]
*  It's a very hard time right now. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=683.92s)]
*  You've put most of the things intact exactly like they were besides one fact that the mother wasn't at the kibbutz. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=686.24s)]
*  He was in another kibbutz that was also attacked. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=696.0s)]
*  And luckily, she and my brother's daughter are safe. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=699.76s)]
*  All the rest of them are kidnapped. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=708.88s)]
*  Like I said, what we need now really need is that the government of Israel and everyone who can force or squeeze or do something to make sure that everyone would work for them to get back our family, get our loved ones. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=711.44s)]
*  That should be the top priority. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=738.72s)]
*  Nothing else. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  All the rest will come later. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=742.32s)]
*  We can talk about a lot of things, but right now we need them back home safe and sound. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=744.24s)]
*  We really, really need someone to talk to us to have a dialogue with us just to have something to grab on. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=753.6s)]
*  This is like no nightmare that I can ever imagine. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=766.96s)]
*  Every hour, every minute we get notifications from friends that their loved ones were killed or their loved ones are not seen at the moment. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=772.08s)]
*  It is so hard to even explain how we feel. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=786.4s)]
*  We are broken. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=792.56s)]
*  We are terrified with what happened. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=794.08s)]
*  We didn't imagine in our worst nightmares that this kind of thing could happen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=797.2s)]
*  And we didn't imagine in our worst nightmares that someone can react or can behave to human beings like they do. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=805.6s)]
*  I heard you heard anything. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=816.32s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=818.64s)]
*  Let me just ask you briefly. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=820.24s)]
*  You mentioned that you needed help trying to create dialogue. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=821.76s)]
*  Have you heard anything from officials or law enforcement or the government about what you should do now, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  about whether they want you to be speaking publicly about anything strategically in terms of how to try to help? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=832.56s)]
*  No, and that's the reason we as families, all the families that have missing persons, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=841.68s)]
*  gathered together in order to get some help from somewhere. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=851.76s)]
*  We know that there are a lot of countries that have people who are either casual deals or are being held by Hamas. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=858.8s)]
*  And I believe that if the whole world or, let's say, the president of Turkey or Saudi Arabia, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=870.08s)]
*  someone that are close and can talk to the Hamas would force them to move or do something to bring our families back. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  This is what we're trying to do. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=890.32s)]
*  We're trying to get our beloved ones back. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=891.92s)]
*  That's the main purpose of our gathering, because we didn't get any notification or any guidance, like you said, from anyone. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=897.44s)]
*  We decided to do it on our own. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you for trusting us to show these images and to tell this story. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=913.36s)]
*  Please keep us apprised. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=918.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't I wish I could say something more concrete in terms of what we can offer, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=920.0s)]
*  but please stay in touch with us and let us know. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  And I hope you hear something soon. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=926.88s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=929.92s)]
*  Thank you for letting us be here and show our pain. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=931.04s)]
*  I hope this will help eventually. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=939.52s)]
*  So do we. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=940.8s)]
*  Yaniv Yakov joining us tonight live from southern Israel. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=941.92s)]
*  This is, as you say, Ben, this is the I think you said this is the fourth Gaza war that you've lived through. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=947.28s)]
*  This one is different from all other previous conflicts because of this mass hostage taking strategy. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=953.0400000000001s)]
*  And obviously that the cruelty and and and terrorizing of the individual people who are victimized by this tactic is one outcome. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=960.24s)]
*  It also has an outcome. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  You see them prioritizing the photographing and filming of both murders and hostage takings, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=972.88s)]
*  kidnappings to try to spread the terrorizing effect of that. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=978.64s)]
*  Presumably, the hostage taking also has the has the strategic impact, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=983.68s)]
*  tactical impact of providing some sort of a human shield factor for Hamas. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  They're threatening that they'll kill hostages and film it and broadcast it in response to Israel [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=994.96s)]
*  destroying any civilian homes in Gaza. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1002.56s)]
*  Obviously, it's it's hard to know why exactly they are doing it or how they see it ending. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1005.6s)]
*  But how does it constrain or prescribe what the American government can do to know that there are dozens, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1011.84s)]
*  maybe even more hostages taken and that there are Americans among them? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1019.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, there's some practical questions that I'm sure are front of mind in the situation room. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1025.36s)]
*  I can imagine that this is kind of an open ended meeting in the situation room. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1029.6s)]
*  And one of those questions is what intelligence support can we provide to Israel [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1033.92s)]
*  to try to identify who the hostages are and what their locations are? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1038.64s)]
*  And obviously, a second, you know, another concern of the United States is trying to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1042.96s)]
*  determine how many of these people are Americans. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1046.72s)]
*  I think the question going forward is Hamas wants these hostages for a number of reasons, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1049.68s)]
*  perhaps to be human shields against indiscriminate bombardment or ground invasion of Gaza, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1055.8400000000001s)]
*  perhaps to exchange those hostages for Palestinians who are in prison. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  I think a big part of the reason why Hamas probably did this, and nobody knows exactly [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1067.04s)]
*  why they did this, is that they want to establish themselves as the vanguard of Palestinian leadership. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority is weak. They are not delivering on the aspiration of Palestinian state. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  They are kind of a corrupt and sclerotic government. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1081.9199999999998s)]
*  And Hamas wants to demonstrate that they can achieve things like the release of Palestinian [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1085.12s)]
*  prisoners that the Palestinian Authority cannot. And that presents a real dilemma for Israel, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1089.36s)]
*  which is that do you deal with Hamas in some form of prisoner exchange, like the one that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1096.08s)]
*  Qatar is apparently offering, or do you not? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1100.7199999999998s)]
*  The problem is, if you don't, you have no way of assuring the safety of those hostages. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1103.76s)]
*  It feels like Israel is primed for a ground invasion of Gaza, which would lead to a significant [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1110.0s)]
*  loss of life for civilians there and probably significant dangers for the hostages. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1116.16s)]
*  Even what was announced today, the cutoff of electricity and food and water to Gaza, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1120.64s)]
*  well, that could put at risk the hostages themselves. That could cut off power for [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1124.72s)]
*  hospitals. That cut off access to water. And so we have a real variable here that we've not seen [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1128.88s)]
*  before. We had one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, taken hostage by Hamas in the past. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1134.88s)]
*  He ended up being traded for a thousand prisoners. And so that's the length that Israel's gone to get [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1140.88s)]
*  its people back. I think in this case, its desire for retribution, its desire to destroy Hamas, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1146.4s)]
*  is actually kind of at odds with the capacity to assure that you can get the hostages back safely. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1153.76s)]
*  So that's a real dilemma that is facing people in Israel and in the United States right now. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1160.8s)]
*  Yeah. It's a real dilemma that becomes more acute and more of a moral catastrophe with [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1165.68s)]
*  literally each passing minute that those people are in that situation. Ben Rhodes, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1169.84s)]
*  former White House Deputy National Security Advisor. Ben, thank you so much for your time [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1176.0s)]
*  tonight. Really helpful. Thanks, Rachel. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1179.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SISsj-rlpKE&t=1199.84s)]
