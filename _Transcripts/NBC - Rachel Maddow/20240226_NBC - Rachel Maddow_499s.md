# 'Burn it all down': Rule-of-law stands as bulwark against Trumpian lies, so he attacks it
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs)
*  These were adjacent headlines in the Washington Post last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden administration cancels $1.2 billion in student loans with new repayment plan. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=4.68s)]
*  Right next to Trump and allies planning militarized mass deportations, detention camps. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=9.64s)]
*  That's the choice, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=16.84s)]
*  Relief from high student loans or using the military to lock up millions of people in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=18.64s)]
*  huge new camps. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=23.44s)]
*  Adjacent headlines in the Washington Post on the same day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=26.3s)]
*  Both parties at the same point in general election campaigning thinking about what they [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=29.28s)]
*  want to be doing to present to the American people about what their idea is of governing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=32.64s)]
*  And I don't know which of those two sides the American people is more in the mood for, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=39.34s)]
*  but it seems pretty clear to me at least that the best contrast for the Democrats to draw [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=42.96s)]
*  for voters this year is maybe just the simplest one, right? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=48.84s)]
*  Popular, popular, practical accomplishments from President Biden and the Democrats versus [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=52.36s)]
*  burn it all down radicalism being screamed at the top of their lungs by Republicans under [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=59.2s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=63.4s)]
*  And you can't even understand what they're talking about half the time because they speak [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=64.4s)]
*  in their own code. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=67.18s)]
*  Barbara McQuade, who you know and love from her time here as a legal analyst and explainer [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=71.76s)]
*  on MSNBC, she has a new book that comes out tomorrow. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=76.0s)]
*  It's called Attack From Within, how disinformation is sabotaging America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=80.62s)]
*  And in her new book, among other things, Barb explains what she sees as the connection between [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=86.14s)]
*  disinformation, which is the fundamental basis for the book, and authoritarianism, why you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=91.5s)]
*  need to disconnect people from facts about the world, from the noble truth and all its [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  complexity in order to get people to endorse extremism, to endorse extreme new radical [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=103.46s)]
*  changes, to reimagine their lives and to reimagine their country in a way they've never thought [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=110.38s)]
*  of it before. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  Barb in her book talks about the need to hit people emotionally rather than logically. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  She talks about the sort of the utility of the would be authoritarian leader or the authoritarian [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  focusing rhetorically on declinism, convincing people that the country is falling apart. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=130.72s)]
*  The country used to be great, but it's no longer great. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=135.48s)]
*  It's falling apart. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=137.6s)]
*  It's a disaster. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=138.6s)]
*  If you can convince people of that, they will have an emotional reaction about being afraid [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=139.6s)]
*  at the state of the country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=144.4s)]
*  Now they'll have an emotional reaction about wanting to rescue the country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=145.4s)]
*  If they can be convinced that things are so far gone, they will then feel the need for [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=149.2s)]
*  extreme measures for a strong man to come in and, you know, maybe you got to wreck the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=153.2s)]
*  place. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=158.0s)]
*  Maybe you got to break the rules, but it's a kind of rescue mission for a country that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=159.0s)]
*  is otherwise lost. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=161.88s)]
*  And what that means in practical terms, in terms of actually running a political campaign [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=165.12s)]
*  that in a matter of months will supposedly pick a new president, what that means is every [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=169.44s)]
*  day making sure that your message undermines the idea of democracy and the idea of the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=173.8s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=179.16s)]
*  So I mean, this is a this isn't theory. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=181.44s)]
*  This isn't academic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=185.18s)]
*  This is our lives. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=186.18s)]
*  Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who you just saw there yelling about vermin and trash at CPAC. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=187.3s)]
*  He spent last week telling his podcast listeners that the Tom Swazi election in Long Island [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=192.78s)]
*  was stolen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=198.86s)]
*  What? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=199.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=200.86s)]
*  In Steve Bannon world, this was the story of last week. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=202.46s)]
*  This is the special election to replace George Santos. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=205.58s)]
*  There's no suggestion there was anything wrong with the count or anything wrong with the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  conduct of that election at all. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=211.66s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=213.32s)]
*  And so therefore, Steve Bannon tells his acolytes and his followers that that election must [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  have been stolen because a Democrat won and they should not respect the results of it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=221.4s)]
*  Even when it doesn't matter, when it's one special election for one congressional seat [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=226.68s)]
*  and there's no real controversy about it, still you have to say elections don't count. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=230.44s)]
*  Elections aren't real. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=235.62s)]
*  Now on top of that, we've got the Republican National Committee losing its chair, Ronna [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=239.24s)]
*  Romney McDaniel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=243.0s)]
*  She's being replaced summarily by a North Carolina Republican who is reportedly considered [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=244.04s)]
*  by Trump to be more solid specifically on the issue of throwing out election results. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=249.08s)]
*  Ms. McDaniel was no slouch on this issue herself, but apparently Trump wants somebody even stronger [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=254.36s)]
*  specifically on that point. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=259.4s)]
*  He's a stop the steal guy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=261.44s)]
*  And so now he will be now running the RNC if Trump gets his way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=263.08s)]
*  And the politics of running against democracy, the politics of getting Americans to distrust [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=269.52s)]
*  elections and ultimately not want them anymore, that is inextricably intertwined with getting [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=276.08s)]
*  Americans to distrust the legal system, to not trust the courts and not trust the justice [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  system anymore, to not take it seriously, to not obey its dictates, to not respect any [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  of its rules. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=293.61999999999995s)]
*  Barb's book, more than anything, helped me see the connection between those two points, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=296.08s)]
*  between getting rid of elections and getting rid of the rule of law. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  You have to get rid of the rule of law, right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=303.08s)]
*  You have to undermine and problematize it so that you can get away with what you are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=304.52s)]
*  trying to do to elections. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  And this is all over the news right now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=311.84s)]
*  Just on Friday, the Wisconsin Ethics Commission referred a Trump PAC and multiple Republican [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=313.52s)]
*  officials for felony prosecution for their role in a Wisconsin scheme to punish a Republican [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=317.9s)]
*  leader in the Wisconsin state legislature who Trump thought didn't fight hard enough [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=324.24s)]
*  to throw out the election results in that state. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=327.92s)]
*  We want you to throw out those election results. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=330.94s)]
*  You don't do a good enough job. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=333.12s)]
*  We're now going to allegedly commit crimes in order to turf you out of your position. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=334.6s)]
*  Recommended for prosecution as of Friday. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=341.72s)]
*  Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to throw out the sanctions, the sanctions, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=344.88s)]
*  the professional sanctions against Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood for their efforts [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=349.76s)]
*  to overthrow the election results. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=354.36s)]
*  Mike Lindell, Mike Pillow, last week he was ordered by a judge to pay up in a contest [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=356.94s)]
*  he held where he promised $5 million cash to anybody who could disprove his claims that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=362.18s)]
*  a foreign government helped steal the election for Biden. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=367.46s)]
*  Somebody did disprove those claims and now a court says Mr. Pillow has to pay. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=370.8s)]
*  He of course does not want to pay, but a court says he must. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=375.2s)]
*  In Georgia, the right wing group True the Vote that apparently ginned up all the false [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=378.68s)]
*  claims about supposed problems in the Georgia elections in 2020. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=383.0s)]
*  They made hay with those claims for not just weeks around the election, but months and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=386.8s)]
*  ultimately years. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=391.24s)]
*  But when it got put through the legal system, they had to admit to a judge that no, they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=393.0s)]
*  don't actually have any evidence to back up their claims that there was fraud in Georgia. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=399.12s)]
*  Trump and multiple Georgia co-defendants are now going to go on trial for trying to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=404.14s)]
*  overthrow the election result in Georgia, which they did by citing this fake evidence [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  from this group True the Vote. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=413.32s)]
*  What will happen in that case? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=416.38s)]
*  Will that case come to trial? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=418.7s)]
*  Trump and his co-defendants' best hope is not their defense, but their unrelated personal [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=420.78s)]
*  counteroffensive to try to discredit and disqualify the prosecutor to get her thrown off the case. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  The rule of law is protecting democracy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=434.08s)]
*  We've got to get rid of the rule of law. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=436.08s)]
*  Hypocrisy is like a cold, windy day in the winter. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=439.4s)]
*  You don't love it, but it's not like you don't expect it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=445.0s)]
*  But what Barb McQuaid is writing about in her new book and what we are seeing from the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=448.84s)]
*  campaign this year is something that is not inevitable, but something planned, something [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=452.76s)]
*  systematic and something very, very, very radical. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=458.2s)]
*  Democrats are campaigning against it by saying, we're doing normal politics, delivering normal [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=462.88s)]
*  practical results for real world problems. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=467.44s)]
*  The Republicans are promising to burn it all down. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=470.24s)]
*  They have to undermine the idea of democracy and the rule of law in order to get to their [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  endgame. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzA-Pcbuqs&t=477.6s)]
