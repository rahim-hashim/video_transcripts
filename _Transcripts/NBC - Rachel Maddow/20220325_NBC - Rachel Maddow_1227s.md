# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI)
*  The highly circulated Russian tabloid KP had an exclusive interview yesterday with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=0.0s)]
*  former commander in chief of the Russian ground forces. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=5.64s)]
*  His take on Russia's invasion of Ukraine is something. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=9.4s)]
*  He says, quote, we are conducting a military humane operation, one might say surgical, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=13.08s)]
*  in order to save people's lives as much as possible. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=20.02s)]
*  Their houses, roads, bridges, factories, end quote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=22.72s)]
*  Years after that interview published, Russia bombed one of the main bridges between Kiev [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=27.88s)]
*  and the city to its northeast. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=32.6s)]
*  Over the weekend, Russia bombed one of Europe's largest iron and steel factories in the Ukrainian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  port city of Mariupol. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=39.76s)]
*  As for the rest of Mariupol, Russian forces there have stopped advancing traditionally. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=42.28s)]
*  Instead, they are leveling the city from afar. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  They're starving out the civilian population, denying them access to medical and humanitarian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=50.58s)]
*  supplies. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=55.36s)]
*  Russia is quite literally destroying Ukrainian, quote, houses, roads, bridges and factories, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=56.6s)]
*  end quote. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=63.88s)]
*  On Monday, this same Russian tabloid newspaper ran an article saying that nearly 10,000 Russian [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=65.56s)]
*  troops had been killed in Ukraine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=72.68s)]
*  Now within hours, the article had been taken down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=75.36s)]
*  The site published an advisory saying it had been hacked and the story was a fake. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=77.78s)]
*  Keep in mind, 10,000 soldiers is much higher than the Russian government's last public [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=84.56s)]
*  announcement three weeks ago, which only mentioned a loss of 498 troops. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=89.2s)]
*  NATO's estimate is even higher than America's. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  It says up to 40,000 Russian troops have been killed, wounded, captured or are missing in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  action. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=103.92000000000002s)]
*  If any of these non-Russian estimates are correct, it's going to be hard to continue [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  to keep that from the Russian people given images like this one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=110.16s)]
*  This is a funeral for the deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet yesterday in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=114.16s)]
*  Crimea. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=119.96s)]
*  The funeral is for just one of the dozens of high level Russian officers that Ukraine [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=121.2s)]
*  claims they have killed so far. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=126.36s)]
*  Ukraine also claims to have killed six Russian generals, which is basically unheard of in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=128.28s)]
*  modern warfare. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=136.2s)]
*  At some point, no matter how much the Russian government tries to control the narrative, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=138.4s)]
*  the Russian people are going to start noticing just how many military funerals there are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=141.84s)]
*  and how many people they know who've lost loved ones, especially given the victories [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=146.88s)]
*  that we're continuing to see from Ukrainian forces. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=151.36s)]
*  Joining us now is Joshua Yaffa. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=154.32s)]
*  He's a correspondent for the New Yorker based primarily in Moscow, but he was in Ukraine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=155.84s)]
*  the moment Russian bombs started dropping and he's done some incredible reporting from [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=160.32s)]
*  there since. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=164.48s)]
*  He's also the author of Between Two Fires, Truth, Ambition and Compromise in Putin's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  Joshua, thanks for being with us this evening. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=173.6s)]
*  I want to get a sense of, given that you've been inside Ukraine and then to Russia, Putin's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=174.6s)]
*  got a very tight grip on power in Russia. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Does it matter if Russian citizens learn the truth and turn against him? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=183.6s)]
*  Would it actually change something for Vladimir Putin's reality? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=188.12s)]
*  I think it certainly would change something for Vladimir Putin's reality if, as you say, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=191.76s)]
*  Russian citizens en masse were to learn the truth of this war, whether the degree of destruction [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=196.8s)]
*  of Ukrainian cities. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=203.36s)]
*  That's something certainly not talked about on Russian television. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=204.72s)]
*  This continues to be called a special military operation and official channels. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=207.76s)]
*  If you look at polling, many Russians believe that this is a limited military engagement [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=212.56s)]
*  in the east of the country, the Donbas region. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=217.96s)]
*  People aren't aware that Kiev is being bombed, Kharkiv is being bombed, Mariupol. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=221.18s)]
*  You showed those terrible pictures of how destroyed that city is. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  Many people don't know that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=229.66s)]
*  So if Russians were to learn, indeed, the war that is being fought in their name, what [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=230.86s)]
*  it really looks like, the ugliness and horror of that war, I think many of them would be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=235.02s)]
*  surprised, if not shocked, at how widespread the violence is against Ukrainian cities and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=239.02s)]
*  against Ukrainian people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=244.86s)]
*  And I think, of course, equally impactful could be the knowledge of how many Russian [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=246.3s)]
*  soldiers are being killed in this war, this estimate of 10,000 that we saw published in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  a Moscow paper the other day before it was quickly retracted. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=256.38s)]
*  The question is, will they, not what the effect would be, but will they even learn of that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=260.46000000000004s)]
*  information? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=265.54s)]
*  And that, I think, is a bigger question so far since the beginning of the war and in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=266.54s)]
*  the month since the war began, a month today. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=270.94s)]
*  In fact, a number, in fact, nearly all of the leading independent, not even opposition-minded, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=274.22s)]
*  but really just any independent non-state run, non-state controlled sources of information [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  in Russia have been blocked, shuttered. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=286.62s)]
*  Its journalists forced to leave the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=289.62s)]
*  Websites taken down or blocked access to them, even social media, Facebook blocked, Instagram [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=292.3s)]
*  blocked. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=298.74s)]
*  So where will Russians learn that information from? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=299.74s)]
*  That's a really tricky question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=302.26000000000005s)]
*  There are, of course, VPNs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=304.06s)]
*  People are using them, but not everyone has that kind of technical ability. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=305.62s)]
*  Russian government regulators are also trying to go after VPN operators. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=309.46s)]
*  So really it's a cat and mouse game with people left with not many sources where they could [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=313.58s)]
*  find out that sort of information. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=318.3s)]
*  And I think the reason that the Kremlin is being so diligent in going after these sources [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=319.98s)]
*  of information and making sure that Russians don't have access to them is because they [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=325.66s)]
*  if en masse in large numbers, Russians were to learn the truth about this war, it could [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=330.26s)]
*  be really destabilizing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=334.62s)]
*  But I'm just not sure that that, you know, that turn of events will really come anytime [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=336.74s)]
*  soon given the Kremlin's control over the social, political and media spheres. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=341.3s)]
*  And they may well succeed for some time in preventing this information from spreading [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  more widely. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=350.02s)]
*  You ran into some folks today in Lviv, who you and I talked about on this show, a group [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=352.18s)]
*  of volunteers called the Blue and Yellow. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=356.8s)]
*  They transfer critical supplies from supportive neighboring countries to Ukraine. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  They've been doing what they've been doing since 2014, since the Syrian refugee crisis. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=365.64s)]
*  What did you hear? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=370.16s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a group that was put together by a man named Jonas and his friends. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=372.16s)]
*  They're sort of a ragtag group of friends that have been doing this, as you said, since [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=377.88s)]
*  the invasion of Crimea in 2014. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=381.72s)]
*  It is only since this recent invasion a month ago where they've seen an influx of money, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=384.08s)]
*  16 million euros they've gotten in just a month. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=389.08s)]
*  And there you see it on the left side of your screen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=391.96s)]
*  This was this morning in Lviv in a parking lot just right behind me outside of a church [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  in broad daylight, hundreds of flak jackets, scopes for sniper rifles, drones that they [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=397.88s)]
*  say they're going to quote used to drop presence on the Russians. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=403.82s)]
*  That is code for explosives. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=406.76s)]
*  They're using these drones to run them into these armored columns, as well as anti drone [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=408.12s)]
*  jamming equipment, especially here in the western part of the country. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=412.44s)]
*  I was unaware that the Russians are apparently using drones in the western part of the country [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  and some of this anti jamming equipment is what is needed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=419.36s)]
*  There's also an American, there he is, an American amongst the group who said he came [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=422.56s)]
*  over actually because he saw some news reporting on NBC and he wanted to be a part of it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=426.16s)]
*  I asked him what I ask every American that I see here, how did he get here? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=430.44s)]
*  How did that process work? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=433.42s)]
*  Here's a little bit of that exchange. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=434.52000000000004s)]
*  How did you get linked up with this group? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  I just flew to Lithuania and first thing I just went to the Ukrainian embassy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=440.52s)]
*  Andre, like military attache came out. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=446.52s)]
*  I said which company? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=449.52s)]
*  Where? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=450.52s)]
*  The embassy where? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=451.52s)]
*  Vilnius, Lithuania. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=452.52s)]
*  My parents lived there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=453.52s)]
*  I just asked which organization they trust most because I brought some gear myself, bought [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=456.52s)]
*  them my own money and I said I go blue and yellow. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  First day I was working in a warehouse. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=464.52s)]
*  The first day you honest ask who's free to go. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=467.52s)]
*  Here you are. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=469.52s)]
*  And yeah, three days later I'm in Lviv. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=471.52s)]
*  That's my second trip here right now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=474.52s)]
*  And so for countries like Lithuania who very much live in fear of some kind of Russian [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=481.52s)]
*  response to their support, they're using these middlemen, these middle groups, these NGOs [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=486.52s)]
*  to get this here to the country. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=490.52s)]
*  They took this stuff right out of Lithuania alley. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=492.52s)]
*  They put it in vans. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=494.52s)]
*  They drove it right across Poland and they got here this morning. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=495.52s)]
*  That stuff is all headed to the east where we see these horrendous, horrendous videos. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=497.52s)]
*  The city of Mikolayev has also taken heavy losses as it holds off Russia's attempt to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=503.52s)]
*  seize it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=508.52s)]
*  But a senior U.S. official says Ukrainian defenses have not only kept Russian troops from making [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=509.52s)]
*  progress, they forced them to reposition around the city. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=514.52s)]
*  Because of stories like this, it was hard not to be encouraged when the mayor of Kyiv [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=518.52s)]
*  told reporters that Ukrainian forces had retaken the suburb of Makarov. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=522.52s)]
*  But my next guest, Sudarsan Raghavan, a correspondent at large for the Washington Post, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=528.52s)]
*  learned that the situation on the ground is not as clear as what the mayor stated. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=532.52s)]
*  Here's what he wrote in a piece for the Washington Post. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=538.52s)]
*  Quote, as a team of Washington Post journalists passed through the checkpoint on Wednesday, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=541.52s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers ordered them to quickly leave the town, warning of oncoming Russian [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=545.52s)]
*  rockets or military artillery. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=550.52s)]
*  Minutes later, reporters heard the sound of shells falling. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=553.52s)]
*  Black plumes of smoke rose over the houses. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=557.52s)]
*  Soon more blasts followed. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=560.52s)]
*  Makarov remains a contested front line. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=562.52s)]
*  End quote. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=565.52s)]
*  Joining us now is the author of that story, Sudarsan Raghavan. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=566.52s)]
*  Mr. Raghavan, good to see you again. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=570.52s)]
*  Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=572.52s)]
*  Give us the nuance of this because for those who have not spent time in a city like this, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=574.52s)]
*  or that's under conflict or a war zone, how do these things look when the Russians say [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=579.52s)]
*  they've taken it and the Ukrainians say they've taken it back? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=584.52s)]
*  It's blurry. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=587.52s)]
*  It's not like an old fashioned front line. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=589.52s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=593.52s)]
*  Especially in this information age. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=594.52s)]
*  What we're really seeing here is two different wars happening. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=596.52s)]
*  They're intertwined wars happening in Ukraine. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=599.52s)]
*  One that's on the battlefield and the other one that's an information war. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=602.52s)]
*  What happened in Makarov exemplifies these two different wars. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=606.52s)]
*  What you had was the fog of war as well as a propaganda campaign by both sides has made [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=610.52s)]
*  really solid information hard to come by. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=615.52s)]
*  Journalists are increasingly finding it difficult to reach areas outside the capital to independently [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=618.52s)]
*  verify facts due to bombardments, shifting front lines, and just a lack of clarity over [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=623.52s)]
*  the Russian military positions. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=628.52s)]
*  Oftentimes, you're relying on statements from Ukrainian officials as what happened with [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=630.52s)]
*  the incident in Makarov. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=636.52s)]
*  On Tuesday, the defense ministry claimed that the town had been liberated from Russian forces [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=638.52s)]
*  and the Ukrainian forces had planted a Ukrainian flag on top of the town. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=645.52s)]
*  We went the next day to check it out and as you read in the article, we found that it [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=649.52s)]
*  was anything but liberated. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=654.52s)]
*  In fact, the mayor himself told us that this is just all a bunch of nonsense. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=656.52s)]
*  In fact, the Russians were still in control of nearly 15% of the town and it had been [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=661.52s)]
*  like that the past three weeks. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=666.52s)]
*  There were tit for tat battles in the town just like what you're seeing in other parts [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=668.52s)]
*  of Ukraine, especially the north of here in the town of Irpin. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=674.52s)]
*  The Russians definitely had not liberated by any means in this town. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=678.52s)]
*  So when you talk about Irpin or Makarov or places like that, what does taken or liberated [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=686.52s)]
*  even mean? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=691.52s)]
*  How does that get determined? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=692.52s)]
*  We definitely hear about flags being flown. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=694.52s)]
*  That, of course, is the age-old way in which you claim land that wasn't otherwise under [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=697.52s)]
*  your control. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=702.52s)]
*  But what does it mean in these towns? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=703.52s)]
*  Do things keep working? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=705.52s)]
*  Does the city council change allegiances? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=707.52s)]
*  What happens when the Russians take territory? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=710.52s)]
*  Well, it's a very chaotic situation still. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=714.52s)]
*  I mean, people even in Makarov and Irpin, you hear people are still evacuating from these [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=716.52s)]
*  areas even as these claims of liberation take place. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=721.52s)]
*  They're still fighting. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=725.52s)]
*  There's still shelling going on. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=727.52s)]
*  In Makarov, the Russian tanks positioned right outside the town shelling it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=729.52s)]
*  So it's a very chaotic situation. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=734.52s)]
*  Like the mayor, for example, of this town, his main job is to go around now today and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=737.52s)]
*  try to feed people, try to deal with people who have lost their homes from shelling. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=742.52s)]
*  Many of them actually, we were told, are huddled in a hospital inside the town. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=748.52s)]
*  And that hospital is getting shelled as well. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=752.52s)]
*  So the mayor has to deal with all these extremely chaotic situations to really preserve the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=755.52s)]
*  lives of his residents and in some cases, try to get them out. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=761.52s)]
*  And for those who don't want to leave, who want to stick it out, he has to find ways [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=764.52s)]
*  to help them deal with electricity shortage, water shortages, gas and all the other necessities [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=769.52s)]
*  of life. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=775.52s)]
*  More than 3.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=777.52s)]
*  The number includes more than 2.1 million refugees who fled here to Poland. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=780.52s)]
*  And today we got a somber assessment about the number of children in Ukraine who've had to flee [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=785.52s)]
*  their homes. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=791.52s)]
*  UNICEF announced today that more than half of Ukraine's children, a staggering 4.3 million [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=792.52s)]
*  children have been displaced one month into the war. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=798.52s)]
*  With that humanitarian crisis worsening by the minute, President Biden today in Brussels [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=802.52s)]
*  announced that the U.S. will accept up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine with a focus on [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=806.52s)]
*  reuniting displaced Ukrainians with family in the United States. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=813.52s)]
*  He also announced the U.S. will donate more than a billion dollars to help European countries [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=817.52s)]
*  deal with the surge in refugees. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=822.52s)]
*  Here in Warsaw, Poland, a city that has already accepted about three times more refugees than [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=824.52s)]
*  the U.S. is planning to take, the regional government has stepped up to take care of its share [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=829.52s)]
*  of this huge crush of people. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=834.52s)]
*  This sea of cots at this Warsaw Convention Center may look familiar, like the scenes that follow [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=838.52s)]
*  hurricanes, floods and fires, but this disaster is entirely man-made and the people sheltering [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=844.52s)]
*  here may not have the chance to rebuild their homes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=850.52s)]
*  We came here two days ago because we need help. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=854.52s)]
*  We don't know what to do and how to live. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=858.52s)]
*  Currently, we're planning to find a house in the UK. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=861.52s)]
*  We don't have anything in the UK, but just people who are willing to help us. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=866.52s)]
*  Eve Prokopenko is just 15. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=873.52s)]
*  She's here with her mother, alongside 6,000 other refugees here on this day. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=875.52s)]
*  Most don't have a plan. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=881.52s)]
*  To help, the regional government has turned this massive convention center into a safe haven [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=883.52s)]
*  for up to 20,000 people. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=888.52s)]
*  Many arrive sick, so there's medical care on site. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=892.52s)]
*  Obviously, most of the people coming here are women and children, so we have a gynecologist's office. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=897.52s)]
*  And for pregnant women, we can do diagnostics and you can even give birth here, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=903.52s)]
*  which we've already done a couple of times. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=910.52s)]
*  Despite Warsaw being the biggest center that receives refugees from Ukraine, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=913.52s)]
*  what you won't see anywhere around the city are tents or temporary housing. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=917.52s)]
*  A number of refugees are going to a stadium where they can spend some time. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=921.52s)]
*  They're generally then sent to a hostel or some sort of temporary accommodation, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=925.52s)]
*  but after a few days, they end up in private accommodation hosted by Poles [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=929.52s)]
*  or they leave for other European cities. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=934.52s)]
*  Many of those cities can be reached with the help of a temporary bus terminal [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=936.52s)]
*  set up outside the convention hall. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=940.52s)]
*  About a thousand people leave each day as thousands more pour in. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=943.52s)]
*  Some who arrive here, like Eve and her mom, hope to get as far away as possible. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=948.52s)]
*  As we heard, even Russia wants to invade Poland. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=954.52s)]
*  That's horrifying. We're right here. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=958.52s)]
*  So we see a lot of buses and just people are going in really different countries in Europe, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=963.52s)]
*  like in Golan, Italy, everywhere. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=971.52s)]
*  Anywhere they can get just to escape all this. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=974.52s)]
*  That's just one center in one city in Poland, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=981.52s)]
*  which has shouldered more of the refugee burden than any country so far. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=983.52s)]
*  Now, the very first NATO summit was in 1957. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=989.52s)]
*  NATO had been formed eight years earlier, but there had never actually been a NATO summit, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=993.52s)]
*  a meeting of all the leaders of the NATO countries. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=998.52s)]
*  So that was going to be a major world event. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1001.52s)]
*  It was a dozen years after World War II, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1003.52s)]
*  amid the increasing competition between the West and the Soviet Union, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1006.52s)]
*  NATO countries would gather in Paris to reaffirm their unity. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1010.52s)]
*  And the undisputed leader of the alliance was President Dwight Eisenhower, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1014.52s)]
*  not only because he was the American president, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1018.52s)]
*  after being the commander of allied forces in Europe during World War II, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1021.52s)]
*  but before he was elected president, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1025.52s)]
*  Eisenhower became the first supreme allied commander of NATO. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1027.52s)]
*  But President Eisenhower almost didn't make it to that very first NATO summit, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1033.52s)]
*  because just a few weeks before the summit was due to start, this happened. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1037.52s)]
*  Illness stalks the chief executive as he stands bareheaded in the chill autumn air at Blair House. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1045.52s)]
*  Shortly after, a chill sends him to bed, forerunner of more serious news. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1051.52s)]
*  The following day, America hears the alarming tidings. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1056.52s)]
*  From White House physician Howard Snyder, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1059.52s)]
*  the nation learns that the president has suffered a mild stroke, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1062.52s)]
*  resulting in a speech impairment. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1065.52s)]
*  Secretary Dulles and other government leaders, including Defense Secretary McElroy, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1067.52s)]
*  converge on the White House. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1071.52s)]
*  The acting press secretary Ann Wheaton issues bulletins. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1073.52s)]
*  Vice President Nixon sums up the situation. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1077.52s)]
*  We expect that the president, after a period of recuperation, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1081.52s)]
*  will be able to return to his desk in the White House, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1085.52s)]
*  and that he will, as the doctors have indicated, fully recover. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1089.52s)]
*  President Eisenhower had already had a heart attack in office two years earlier. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1096.52s)]
*  Now this mini-stroke. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1100.52s)]
*  There were concerns that he might not be up to the regular duties of office, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1102.52s)]
*  let alone a grueling transatlantic trip to meet with 14 other world leaders. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1106.52s)]
*  The New York Times published this cartoon depicting Eisenhower as Atlas, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1111.52s)]
*  carrying both the problems of his office and questionable health on his back, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1116.52s)]
*  while trudging up a hill marked course of world events. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1121.52s)]
*  The Times worried that going to the NATO summit would be, quote, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1127.52s)]
*  a two-gallon gesture that may bring on another siege of illness. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1130.52s)]
*  But I did go to Paris, arriving at the NATO summit all smiles, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1135.52s)]
*  just three weeks after his health scare. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1140.52s)]
*  And the other NATO leaders were so demonstrably relieved that he made it [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1143.52s)]
*  that Eisenhower started his opening remarks at the summit, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1147.52s)]
*  thanking them all for their well wishes. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1150.52s)]
*  Mr. President, my NATO friends, before I begin, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1154.52s)]
*  I should like to express my appreciation of the over-generous sentiments [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1161.52s)]
*  that have been expressed by President Besh and by the Prime Minister of France, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1167.52s)]
*  respecting myself. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1173.52s)]
*  And particularly, I appreciate your good wishes for my good health. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1175.52s)]
*  And so the very first NATO summit ever began, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1181.52s)]
*  the first of nearly 30 NATO summits that have taken place in the decade since. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1186.52s)]
*  And NATO's membership in that time has doubled. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1190.52s)]
*  In 1957, there were 15 NATO countries. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1194.52s)]
*  Now there are 30. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1197.52s)]
*  And so at today's NATO summit in Brussels, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1199.52s)]
*  they needed a much bigger table for their meeting than they did in 1957. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1201.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_EUpSIYWcI&t=1210.52s)]
