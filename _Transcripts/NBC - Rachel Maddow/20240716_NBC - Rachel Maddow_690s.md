# Forfeiting their souls: Haley performs Republican ritual of personal debasement for Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA)
*  Joining us now from the RNC is reporter Tim Alberta, who has chronicled the fortunes of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=0.0s)]
*  many Republican hopefuls and their campaigns, including Ambassador Nikki Haley, who had [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=7.12s)]
*  quite the wild ride in her now very much over fight with Trump this year. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=11.96s)]
*  Tim, it's great to have you with us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=17.48s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=18.96s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=19.96s)]
*  So Nikki Haley and her relationship with Trump, it's like watching one of those paddle games [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=22.96s)]
*  where the ball is attached by an elastic string and it keeps coming back and coming in for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=29.68s)]
*  another whack. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=34.32s)]
*  Was there any doubt that she would be giving this speech if she were asked to, that she [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=36.6s)]
*  would be giving a full and unequivocal endorsement at the end of her journey with Trump, including [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=41.24s)]
*  the way she ran against him this year? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  No, not in my mind. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=49.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you why, because one of the just vivid memories of the last few years [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=52.36s)]
*  for me was sitting with Nikki Haley in her country club in South Carolina in the days [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=58.2s)]
*  after January 6th. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=63.56s)]
*  I'd spent a lot of time with her over the previous couple of months for a profile that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=65.56s)]
*  I was writing in Politico magazine, and the profile was just about over and then January [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=69.4s)]
*  6th happened. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=74.88s)]
*  And so she invited me back down for another conversation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=75.88s)]
*  In that conversation, Rachel, Nikki Haley said to me, listen, Donald Trump let us down. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't have listened to him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=84.88s)]
*  We shouldn't have followed him down this path. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=86.66s)]
*  And we can never follow him again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  That's what she said to me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=91.38s)]
*  And what was so striking in that moment was, of course, there were Republicans and Democrats [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  in the House and in the Senate at that point, considering whether to impeach Trump, maybe [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  even whether to invoke the 25th Amendment against Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=105.58s)]
*  And I asked her, if you were in Congress, would you be on board with that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  Would you be trying to oust Trump at this point? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=112.46s)]
*  And she told me, oh, well, that doesn't matter, because he's already dead politically. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=115.58s)]
*  He can never come back from this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=120.12s)]
*  He's sunken too far. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=121.9s)]
*  The damage is done. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=123.02s)]
*  So there's no need to do any of that, because his career, as we've known it, is over. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=124.38s)]
*  And here we are today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=130.78s)]
*  Nikki Haley's arc vis-a-vis Donald Trump has been more dramatic than most, but I actually [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=133.14s)]
*  think in many ways she is probably the best, the most accurate representative of how so [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=138.06s)]
*  many people who know better and who publicly came out against Trump and said that he was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=144.74s)]
*  effectively unfit to be commander in chief, how they somehow, some way always wind up [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  coming back and accommodating themselves to him in the end. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=155.38s)]
*  Is that because there's something for her in it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=159.98s)]
*  I mean, I don't think that she's got a place in a second Trump administration. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=164.38s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=169.54s)]
*  Having gone much further than just criticizing him in normal terms, even with giving this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=171.5s)]
*  speech, she has to expect that she's not going to win any obvious or immediate prize here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=175.94s)]
*  Is the calculation here in terms of the way Nikki Haley thinks about politics that someday [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  in a post-Trump future, she'll be remembered as a good enough soldier to win voters' trust [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=187.18s)]
*  again? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=194.14s)]
*  I mean, where does she see this is going? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=195.14s)]
*  You know, what's interesting, Rachel, is as I've spent the last couple of days here on [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=197.7s)]
*  the convention floor talking with delegates, it really is remarkable how short of a memory [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=202.78s)]
*  many of these people have. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=208.34s)]
*  It doesn't matter that JD Vance called Donald Trump America's Hitler. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=210.42s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you even look at the primetime speaking lineup, I would venture to say that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  it's maybe one out of every three Republicans being featured this week speaking at the convention [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=219.5s)]
*  have in the past offered some blistering, like really, really harsh criticisms of Donald [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  Trump, not even at a political level, but at a personal level, calling him unethical, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=230.3s)]
*  immoral, unfit for office, what have you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=234.46s)]
*  And yet, as long as they come back around and they kiss the ring and they apologize [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=236.9s)]
*  and swear that they didn't mean it, then they wind up being embraced by the party faithful. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=241.66s)]
*  And so I think if you're Nikki Haley, you understand that even though you were critical [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=246.72s)]
*  of Trump back in 2016 saying that he behaved like a kindergartner and that he was an embarrassment, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=251.74s)]
*  or even if you were critical of him in 2020 saying that he'd fallen so far and that we [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=257.18s)]
*  should never follow him again, you recognize that in politics, especially in Trump era [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=261.46s)]
*  Republican politics, people have a really short memory and they're ultimately willing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  to forgive and forget and move on as long as you sort of debase yourself and ultimately [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=270.78s)]
*  bend the knee to him when it really counts most. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=276.62s)]
*  Tim, when you do these kinds of sort of longitudinal profiles, when you spend time with a person [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  like Nikki Haley for the type of journalism that you've been doing for Politico Magazine [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=286.06s)]
*  and elsewhere, do you feel like you're seeing the cost of that debasement? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=289.46s)]
*  I mean, it is a feature. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  It is a regular feature. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not an accidental or coincidental or incidental thing that happens with Trump, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  that he regularly demands debasement. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=303.46s)]
*  He regularly demands not just that Mexico is going to get a wall on its border, but [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=306.62s)]
*  that they're going to pay for it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=310.78s)]
*  There's this sort of this insult, this groveling that he demands and that he regularly gets [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=312.18s)]
*  from everybody else in Republican politics who has sort of fallen behind as he's taken [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=316.62s)]
*  over that party in its entirety. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=321.94s)]
*  Do you see what that costs them as people, just as human beings? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  Rachel, one of my favorite verses in scripture is Mark 836, which says, what should it [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=329.62s)]
*  profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=336.46s)]
*  And to the question you're asking, what we have seen in so many cases, Nikki Haley, among [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=340.38s)]
*  others, is truly nothing short of a forfeiting of one's soul in order to gain this sort of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=346.06s)]
*  temporary affections of Donald Trump, of his inner circle, of the party base, what have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=352.78s)]
*  you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=357.5s)]
*  But yes, there is a real and profound and cascading damage that is done to these people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=358.5s)]
*  Nikki Haley, as an example, I can tell you that in reporting my profile of her, I spoke [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=364.54s)]
*  with dozens and dozens of people who had been friends, confidants, allies of hers over the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=369.62s)]
*  years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=374.1s)]
*  And most of those people are no longer even in contact with Nikki Haley. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=375.1s)]
*  They feel entirely estranged from her, in part because they feel as though she lied [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  to them and that she effectively conned them into believing that she had a set of principles [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=383.5s)]
*  that were ironclad, that came from a deep place of conviction. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=389.7s)]
*  And she jettisoned them at the first opportunity to gain some sort of entree into the world [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=399.46s)]
*  And that is the story of so many Republicans in the Trump era. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=400.46s)]
*  And frankly, it's a bit heartbreaking at a certain level, because when you talk with [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  some of these people on the other side, when you talk to people who have sort of sustained [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=409.26s)]
*  this damage to their family relationships, to their professional careers, to their reputation, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=414.65999999999997s)]
*  to their integrity, when you talk to them on the other side of it, what they will tell [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=419.34s)]
*  you time and time again is it was not worth it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=423.61999999999995s)]
*  And I think that obviously that realization hits some people sooner than others. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=428.61999999999995s)]
*  Tim Alberta, Atlantic Staff writer, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=434.29999999999995s)]
*  Your thoughtful journalism on this and aggressive journalism on this has really helped our own [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=439.7s)]
*  understanding of it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=443.5s)]
*  But it's been really invaluable to have you here tonight, Tim. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=444.5s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=446.46s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=447.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=448.58s)]
*  You saw Nikki Haley just leave the stage moments ago, leaving to a rousing ovation, a sort [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=449.58s)]
*  of straight up ovation, very much in contrast to the mix of booing and cheering that greeted [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=454.62s)]
*  her arrival on the stage. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=460.02s)]
*  That's your signal that she did what she was there to do, which was to make a totally unequivocal [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=462.02s)]
*  endorsement of Donald Trump. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=467.14s)]
*  I thought that was actually very poignant what Tim Alberta was saying there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=469.14s)]
*  Tim Alberta, who's done incredible journalism about Nikki Haley and spent a lot of time [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=472.17999999999995s)]
*  with her talking about the reaction of those in her own life and in her own political circles [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=476.46s)]
*  in which she's essentially alone now. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=482.46s)]
*  People feel betrayed by her after her run against Donald Trump, people feeling, in Tim's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=484.97999999999996s)]
*  words, that she had conned them into thinking that she had some sort of real principled [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=489.7s)]
*  stand against a figure like Trump. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=494.9s)]
*  It's also interesting, you see Ron DeSantis on the stage right now. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=498.02s)]
*  Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley essentially equivalent figures in Republican politics right now, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=500.94s)]
*  despite the very different approaches each of them took toward running against Trump in 2024. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=506.42s)]
*  Haley did go right at Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=511.94s)]
*  Ron DeSantis never did. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=514.1s)]
*  But it doesn't matter. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=516.34s)]
*  They're both destroyed by Trump in the primary. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=517.34s)]
*  Undermined had not only their supporters but their donors attacked by Trump and are now [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=520.14s)]
*  both reduced to a sort of twin speaking role engagement that doesn't reflect anything, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=524.94s)]
*  any credit at all for the slack that Ron DeSantis cut Donald Trump for some of the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=530.86s)]
*  primary that Nikki Haley did not. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=537.02s)]
*  You all end up at the same bottom of the same barrel. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=539.22s)]
*  Nicole Wallace has been watching along with us. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=542.5s)]
*  Nicole, obviously that's some news from the dais tonight, from the stage. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=544.9s)]
*  Nikki Haley saying that she has a strong endorsement tonight to offer of Donald Trump and then [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=549.98s)]
*  spent the rest of her speech trying to talk people who didn't support Donald Trump initially [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=554.78s)]
*  into why they should change like she has. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=559.6600000000001s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=562.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm still so, I mean, Tim Alberta speaks in poetry of his own. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=564.58s)]
*  He's so unique and he's so distinct. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=570.74s)]
*  And I think he distilled the conversation you were all having at the top of the hour, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  the why, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=576.86s)]
*  And it's the abandoning of all their souls that is still in year nine of covering the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=578.26s)]
*  Trump story, disorienting, right? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=583.1800000000001s)]
*  And we watched Chris Christie do it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=585.34s)]
*  We watched Marco Rubio do it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=587.0200000000001s)]
*  We watched Ted Cruz do it under the most brutally. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=588.66s)]
*  I mean, one was called fat. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=590.86s)]
*  One's wife was called ugly. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=592.34s)]
*  And the other was, you know, the implication was that small hands meant small something [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=593.34s)]
*  else. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=597.5s)]
*  And they all rolled over. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=598.5s)]
*  And to see that that phenomenon is ongoing on year nine of the Trump story is remarkable. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=599.58s)]
*  Trump doesn't care about any of them. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=605.14s)]
*  He was today engaged in a Twitter war because what President Joe Biden is considering doing [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=606.58s)]
*  with the Supreme Court rattles him. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=612.22s)]
*  He got on social media and he sent out a post, trash talking that idea. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=614.54s)]
*  He doesn't really have his mind or his gut with anyone in the room. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=621.0999999999999s)]
*  His mind is on winning. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=626.02s)]
*  And Tim Alberta's extraordinary piece of journalism before his reporting this week was about the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=627.2199999999999s)]
*  sort of, I don't even want to call them brain trust, but the strategic nerve center, the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=633.86s)]
*  Trump campaign and the smears against Joe Biden and the brutally perfect, not perfect, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=638.1s)]
*  brutally personal attacks against him. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=645.5s)]
*  That was their plan all along. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=649.82s)]
*  So to watch sort of to watch both pieces come together and sort of collide, you really have [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=651.94s)]
*  to reduce it all to politics because that is all it is to Donald Trump. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=660.1s)]
*  Yeah, politics and politics and power even more bluntly. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBgEke6S8nA&t=664.02s)]
