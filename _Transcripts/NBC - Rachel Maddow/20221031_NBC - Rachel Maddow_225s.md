# Litany Of Trump Legal Entanglements Grows Ever Longer As Trump Org Criminal Trial Begins
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU)
*  So, the criminal trial of Donald Trump's family business got underway today, the trial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=0.0s)]
*  in which his namesake company is charged with engaging in a 15-year, multimillion-dollar [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=4.64s)]
*  tax evasion scheme. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=9.3s)]
*  We're eight days out from the midterm elections, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  For the de facto leader of the Republican Party, their last president, their all-but-certain [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=15.16s)]
*  nominee for president in the next election, this is a very awkward time to be dragged [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=19.14s)]
*  into court for a criminal tax evasion trial. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=24.3s)]
*  But I've got to tell you, that's like one egg and a whole carton for him today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=27.92s)]
*  I mean, also, simultaneously today, the criminal trial continues of Trump's longtime friend, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=31.68s)]
*  the chair of his presidential inauguration committee, Tom Barrack. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=37.84s)]
*  Barrack is charged with acting as a secret agent of a foreign government, trying to influence [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=42.56s)]
*  the U.S. government in order to make money for himself from a foreign power. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=48.04s)]
*  So today, jury selection began in a civil trial of Trump and his company over charges [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=52.48s)]
*  that he ordered his security guards to physically attack protesters outside Trump Tower during [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=57.08s)]
*  Trump's campaign. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=62.919999999999995s)]
*  Trump himself had to sit for a deposition in that civil case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  That's not to be confused with the deposition he also had to sit for a couple of weeks ago [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=67.2s)]
*  in the defamation case deriving from a woman alleging that he raped her in the mid-'90s. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=70.92s)]
*  Also, today, Trump petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and block the House of Representatives [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=77.2s)]
*  from getting a copy of his tax returns, which he's been desperately trying for years to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=83.92s)]
*  keep anyone from seeing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=88.48s)]
*  Also, Trump is now on his knockoff social media site ranting about how he cannot believe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=90.36s)]
*  that the Mar-a-Lago classified documents federal criminal case is still going on, even as one [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=95.8s)]
*  of his most loyal lieutenants just pled the fifth before a grand jury considering that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=101.0s)]
*  case, which, by the way, if you're keeping score at home, brings the number of people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=105.24s)]
*  in Trump's orbit who've pled the fifth in various recent cases to at least nine, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  including Trump himself, who spent hours taking the fifth in yet another investigation, the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=113.8s)]
*  New York attorney general's investigation of his financial practices. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=118.52s)]
*  Also, in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into his efforts to violently [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  overthrow the government on January 6th, the Justice Department is now asking a federal [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=128.2s)]
*  judge to compel Trump's White House counsel and his deputy White House counsel to testify [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=132.6s)]
*  about their conversations with him before that federal grand jury. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=138.12s)]
*  Also, the seditious conspiracy trial continues of the right-wing pro-Trump paramilitary group, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  the Oath Keepers, who say they came to Washington on January 6th to fight physically to keep [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=147.48s)]
*  Trump in power. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=152.64s)]
*  At that trial today, there was dramatic testimony from Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=154.24s)]
*  told the jury about physically blocking a group of Oath Keepers from getting to Nancy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=159.8s)]
*  Pelosi's office on January 6th as he and his colleagues raced to get her staffers to safety. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=164.56s)]
*  I mean, that's what's going on around the leader of the Republican Party just today, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=170.56s)]
*  all in a day's work, eight days before the midterm elections. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=176.76s)]
*  And all of this, it is not unrelated to the precarious political moment that we are in, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=181.0s)]
*  right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=184.88s)]
*  The system that operates on the rule of law and free and fair elections doesn't work [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=186.04s)]
*  all that well for a party whose leader is in personal legal jeopardy under that system [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=190.6s)]
*  in all these different ways, whose family business is literally on trial right now, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=196.04s)]
*  as of today, on criminal charges. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  . [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95zSS5keWPU&t=215.88s)]
