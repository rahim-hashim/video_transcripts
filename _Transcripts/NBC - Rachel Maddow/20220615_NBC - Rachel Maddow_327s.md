# Congresswoman Says She Saw More Tours Than Loudermilk's Ahead Of Jan. 6 Attack
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw)
*  Today, when the January 6th investigation released shocking video of a Republican congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=0.0s)]
*  named Barry Loudermilk leading an hours-long tour of all the House office buildings the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  day before the Capitol attack, a tour, it turns out, for multiple people who participated [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  in the events of January 6th the next day, well, that was a vindication of sorts for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=15.94s)]
*  Democratic congresswoman, Mikey Sherrill of New Jersey. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=21.32s)]
*  It was Congresswoman Sherrill who raised the alarm more than a year ago, right after the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=25.0s)]
*  When she said she saw Republican members of Congress leading tours like that for people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=29.36s)]
*  who then participated in the attack on the Capitol the following day. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=33.28s)]
*  Congresswoman Sherrill has been rabidly criticized by Republicans, including Congressman Loudermilk, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=37.68s)]
*  for having raised these allegations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=42.92s)]
*  They claimed these allegations were definitely false. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=44.72s)]
*  We now know what she said was absolutely and specifically true. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=47.56s)]
*  Tonight, Congresswoman Sherrill has released this statement that says in part, quote, I've [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=51.68s)]
*  served our country as a federal prosecutor and know how important it is to investigate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=56.0s)]
*  and collect evidence and to let that process run its course. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=59.52s)]
*  The video evidence released today by the bipartisan January 6th committee, combined with the constantly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=62.84s)]
*  shifting narrative and misdirection from Representatives Barry Loudermilk and Rodney Davis, call into [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=67.28s)]
*  question their dedication to our common oath as members of Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now live is Democratic congresswoman, Mikey Sherrill of New Jersey. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=78.56s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for making time to be here tonight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=81.84s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=85.16s)]
*  I just spoke with your colleague, Zoe Lofgren, who's a member of the January 6th investigation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=86.16s)]
*  I'm going to ask you the same question I asked her, which is, have I misstated any [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=90.64s)]
*  of this? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=94.56s)]
*  Did I get any of this wrong? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=95.56s)]
*  Or is there any big piece of this that our viewers should understand that I haven't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=96.56s)]
*  explained? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  No, Rachel, this is, as you said, a story you've been following really from the beginning [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  of it, and I think you've tracked it quite well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  What is your reaction today to this video being released by the January 6th investigation? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=109.92s)]
*  When I saw this today, my thought was, this is what Congresswoman Sherrill saw. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=115.88s)]
*  This is what concerned her. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=121.28s)]
*  Was the video they released today in fact what you saw and what caused you to set off [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=123.16s)]
*  those red flags? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=126.84s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you know, I've talked to people about the fact that as a Navy helicopter pilot, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=128.32s)]
*  we've been through training to recognize suspicious things. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=136.48s)]
*  As a former federal prosecutor, of course, I believe deeply that if you see things like [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=140.0s)]
*  this, if there's an investigation going on, you have to come forward. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  It's your duty to come forward to talk about this stuff. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=148.16s)]
*  But you know, as I was talking about how odd it was that the Capitol complex was closed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=152.16s)]
*  and there were visitors there, and they just were doing odd things. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  They were in places they should not have been acting in a suspicious way, especially in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=160.04s)]
*  light of the attack on January 6th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  I think what this video shows is, yes, what I was talking about. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  In fact, quite a few members have come out and former members as well saying this is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=172.88s)]
*  not what tours look like. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  These are not places you take tours. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=181.32s)]
*  And that is what I was highlighting, and that's what I had wanted the January 6th committee [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=184.28s)]
*  to investigate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=188.88s)]
*  And certainly we see some of the results of that investigation today. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=189.88s)]
*  Do you know if there were more tours like this, either other tours led by Congressman [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=195.0s)]
*  Laudermilk or others led by other members? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  That is not the only group that I saw. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=203.64s)]
*  You know, I saw groups down there, and I think what we've asked the January 6th committee [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  to do is to understand what those people were doing in the Capitol complex. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=211.32s)]
*  That's what we asked really the sergeant in arms to get to the bottom of what was going [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=215.56s)]
*  on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=221.0s)]
*  We've seen the January 6th committee working to do just that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=222.08s)]
*  And you know, Rachel, I mentioned I was a helicopter pilot and a federal prosecutor, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=226.08s)]
*  but I don't think it takes that to come forward in an investigation when the Capitol has been [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=231.76s)]
*  attacked, when the former president tried to stay in office despite the will of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=237.84s)]
*  American people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=242.72s)]
*  If you have evidence in that situation, if you've taken an oath to the Constitution [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=244.04s)]
*  of the United States, you have a duty to come forward. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think what's so, remains shocking to me is the constantly shifting narrative, the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=252.76s)]
*  misdirection of Representative Laudermilk and Representative Davis, and then to see [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=260.04s)]
*  this video, to see, you know, exactly what he was doing and knew that he had done and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=265.72s)]
*  failure to come forward, his failure to talk to the committee, I really think is again, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=274.04s)]
*  just really shocking to me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=281.16s)]
*  And as you said in your statement tonight, it calls into question their dedication to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  our common oath as members of Congress. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=287.0s)]
*  That's a serious way to put it, but I understand your reasoning. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=289.16s)]
*  Congressman Mikey Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, I really appreciate your time tonight [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=292.92s)]
*  as we continue to stay on this story. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=297.32s)]
*  Who knew it would have evolved like this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=298.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=300.92s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQymmNzXVdw&t=301.48s)]
