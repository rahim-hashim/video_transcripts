# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 14
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4)
*  In 2008, Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia, the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=0.0s)]
*  During that invasion, Russia sent its flagship guided missile cruiser, the Moskva, to the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=5.2s)]
*  Black Sea to support that invasion of Georgia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=10.8s)]
*  Six years later, Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=14.96s)]
*  He invaded and took Crimea, part of Ukraine, in 2014. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=16.96s)]
*  And again, that same ship, the Moskva, was deployed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=21.32s)]
*  It played a critical role in blocking Ukrainian ships from leaving an important naval base [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=23.56s)]
*  to try to confront the Russians. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Then one year later, in 2015, the Moskva was once again deployed, this time to support [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=31.08s)]
*  Russia's brutal military campaign in Syria in support of the dictator Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=35.68s)]
*  So the Moskva is really their go-to warship. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=43.32s)]
*  It has an extensive recent history in playing a key military role every time Putin keeps [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=46.2s)]
*  trying to redraw the maps of the former Soviet Union. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=51.2s)]
*  Well now, this flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet has apparently been sunk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=55.84s)]
*  The Ukrainian government is claiming that the ship sunk after it was hit by a Ukrainian-made [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=61.2s)]
*  Neptune anti-ship missile. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=66.0s)]
*  The Russian version of the story is that that isn't why the ship sunk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=69.0s)]
*  It sunk due to a fire, due to, quote, whole damage received during a fire from the detonation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=72.56s)]
*  of ammunition. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=78.44s)]
*  The United States has reportedly not confirmed either version of events, but it's already [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=80.72000000000001s)]
*  had a practical effect on the state of play in the Black Sea. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=85.56s)]
*  One senior US defense official told reporters that about half a dozen Russian ships in the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=88.58000000000001s)]
*  Black Sea moved themselves farther out to sea, farther off the Ukrainian coast after [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  the Moskva was hit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  But you think about it, it's not the sort of thing you would do if the Moskva went down [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=100.4s)]
*  because somebody was, like, smoking in the ammunition room, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=104.26s)]
*  Why would that sort of a catastrophe on board your flagship vessel cause you to move all [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=107.84s)]
*  of the other ships further offshore? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  That wouldn't solve the problem if you guys just started a fire on board your own ship. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=115.0s)]
*  The Russians are obviously trying to save face by saying it was just a fire, by denying [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  it was that the Ukrainians sunk it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=125.12s)]
*  But either way, the damage is done. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=127.2s)]
*  The ship is gone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=129.22s)]
*  And if you think about for a second how they are trying to make it all sound, it's not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=131.32s)]
*  even a really good argument. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=134.88s)]
*  As US national security adviser Jake Sullivan put it today, quote, one story is that it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=136.82s)]
*  was just incompetence, meaning we set a fire on board our own ship. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=141.66s)]
*  The other story is that they came under attack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=146.5s)]
*  Neither is a particularly good outcome for them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  My next guest agrees with this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  Joining us now is Mason Clark. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=155.06s)]
*  He's the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=156.06s)]
*  Mr. Clark, I appreciate you taking time to be with us tonight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=158.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=163.42s)]
*  We have had a lot of discussion already, even before we knew that the Moskva was lost, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=165.14s)]
*  when we just heard that it might have been hit or that it was somehow damaged for some [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=170.98s)]
*  reason. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  We've heard a lot about how that would have a morale impact, that that would boost the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  morale of the Ukrainians and it would hurt the morale of the Russians. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=178.92s)]
*  I know morale is a practical thing in wartime, but beyond just the morale factor, how important [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=182.38s)]
*  is this loss in practical terms for the Russians? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=188.22s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=191.73999999999998s)]
*  So it's certainly more important in terms of the morale swing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=193.38s)]
*  Of course, the Moskva was very infamous as the Russian warship involved in the Snake [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=196.5s)]
*  Island incident at the beginning of the war. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=200.7s)]
*  But in terms of actual capabilities, it's certainly supported the Russian campaign through [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  a number of guided missile strikes, particularly on Ukrainian rear areas. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=208.34s)]
*  But those have been a very small proportion of the air and missile strikes that Russian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=212.94s)]
*  forces have carried out throughout the war. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=217.46s)]
*  So while it's certainly a blow, it's not going to change the course of the campaign, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  I'd say, by depriving the Russians of any capability. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, of course, with the Russian warships backing off from the Black Sea coast, as you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  noted, not something you would do if you had a fire just in your ammunition area. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=232.45999999999998s)]
*  That's likely going to deprive some of those Russian forces along the coast of air defenses [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=236.7s)]
*  against the Ukrainian air force that some of these warships have been providing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  So that may be a more immediate tactical impact. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=245.44s)]
*  But in terms of actual Russian offensive capabilities, frankly, these warships have not been that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=248.6s)]
*  essential to begin with. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  And in terms of the Ukrainian offensive capabilities, if Ukraine is borne out, if they're correct, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=256.2s)]
*  that they were able to sink this warship effectively with a missile strike. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=262.44s)]
*  I mean, I'm no expert in naval warfare, but as far as I know, that's a pretty rare way, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=267.32s)]
*  if not a unique way, to sink a warship, particularly one of this size. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=271.64s)]
*  And it would indicate that Ukraine has more capacity of this type. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  They've got weapons that haven't previously been used in wartime that might be more effective [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=283.76s)]
*  than had been previously conceived. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=288.4s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=290.4s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=291.4s)]
*  This is actually likely the first time that Neptune has been used in combat. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=293.36s)]
*  It was only introduced in the Ukrainian arsenal, I believe, in 2019. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=296.9s)]
*  It was quite recently. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=300.32s)]
*  And with its domestic Ukrainian missile. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=302.4s)]
*  But even in addition to this, Ukraine is increasingly receiving similar systems from the UK and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=305.06s)]
*  various other Western partners that will allow them to push back on Russian dominance in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  the Black Sea. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  We've already assessed for some time that there's very little chance that the Russians [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  would be able to mount an amphibious invasion on the southern coast of Ukraine, which was [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=319.55999999999995s)]
*  a worry earlier in the war. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  But particularly with Ukraine, almost certainly having demonstrated that it could threaten [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=325.44s)]
*  such a landing, it has to be completely off the table. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=329.44s)]
*  And it's definitely going to be a huge boon to the Ukrainian military and sort of lessening [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=333.0s)]
*  that threat and enabling them probably to carry out their own operations on the Black [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=337.8s)]
*  Sea, whereas the Ukrainian Navy has been pretty bottled up in ports since the early days of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=342.92s)]
*  the war, at least until now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Clark, can I also just ask you, there's a lot of discussion now, including discussion [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  led by the U.S. government, sort of advising the U.S. public what to think about, what's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=355.64s)]
*  going to come next. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=359.36s)]
*  We're told to expect that Russia is regrouping, repositioning and that they're planning for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=360.59999999999997s)]
*  a major ground operation in eastern Ukraine and perhaps also in southern Ukraine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  Are we seeing the kind of movement of forces? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=374.2s)]
*  Are we seeing the kind of massing of forces that would indicate that something like that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=377.08s)]
*  is imminent? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  Is it possible that Russia isn't about to mount an operation that that large or that it might be [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=382.48s)]
*  further off in the future than we've been led to believe? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=387.72s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like they've got the manpower and the material in place to do something [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=390.56s)]
*  of this on the scale that we've been led to expect. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, you sort of hit the nail on the head right there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=400.0s)]
*  They're trying to, but we don't think it's going to be very effective. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  We are seeing a lot of signs on the ground, both reports from Ukrainian intelligence as well as [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=405.16s)]
*  just videos from both Russian and Ukrainian civilians of large Russian columns moving from [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=409.6s)]
*  the northeastern Ukrainian border down into Rostov and other key Russian cities supporting those [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=416.12s)]
*  operations in eastern Ukraine. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  The issue, though, is that a lot of these units were badly chewed up in fighting around Kiev and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=423.56s)]
*  Trenlykiv and Sumy, these areas in northeastern Ukraine that Russian forces have had to abandon in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=429.04s)]
*  the last couple of weeks. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=434.12s)]
*  They have not really had the time to reform, replace lost equipment, restore morale. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=435.56s)]
*  These troops are very demoralized and they're unlikely to really contribute much to Russian combat power [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=440.68s)]
*  in their damaged state. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=446.24s)]
*  I don't want to overstate that, unfortunately, just the sheer weight of numbers and the resources of the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  Russian military may be able to push through Ukrainian defenses in some areas when they do launch a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  wider offensive likely in the next week or two. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=457.64s)]
*  But I certainly don't think that the Russian military has the capability to conduct the large [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=460.0s)]
*  breakthrough that they would like to at this point in the war due to how badly their initial operations [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=464.72s)]
*  went and how sparse their remaining reserves are. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  Mason Clark, the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, Mr. Clark, it's clarifying and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=475.08s)]
*  interesting to talk to you about this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=480.44s)]
*  Thanks for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=481.48s)]
*  Of course, thanks for having me. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  This is one of those segments that has a lot of visuals. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=486.72s)]
*  So if you're watching the dishes or like doing some other thing, this is one that's worth seeing [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  because they've got access to his house now and the house, you can tell from the outside, is designed [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  to look like a palace. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=501.48s)]
*  It kind of looks like a cross between a palace and a bank, maybe. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=503.6s)]
*  I don't know. The building is clearly being remodeled. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=506.64s)]
*  It's being renovated. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=511.0s)]
*  But all the stuff is there, including all his art stuff. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=512.88s)]
*  There's a huge rack of gigantic paintings. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  Look at the size of them. They're like mural sized paintings, but in big gold frames. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=520.64s)]
*  There's also a whole other rack of paintings that appears to all be just portraits of the same woman. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=524.8s)]
*  I think that's all portraits of the wife. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  There's also a closet full of designer clothes for her. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=534.0s)]
*  There's also a weird room full of boxed jewelry and boxed trinkets and things. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm not totally sure what some of those things are. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=544.36s)]
*  There's a room full of antiques, including like certificates of authenticity for the various antiques. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=547.48s)]
*  So that's what's inside. But then you go outside onto the grounds. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=554.6s)]
*  And this is weird. It's like this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  It's kind of waggling around a little bit in the breeze. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=559.4000000000001s)]
*  What's that? It's covered in military camouflage netting. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  So it really isn't easy to see what that is. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=564.72s)]
*  Presumably that makes it not easy to see from above. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  But honestly, it's even kind of hard to figure out what it is from the ground, as you can see here. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=570.2s)]
*  Well, if you pop inside, as that guy does, you can see what is in there. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  What's in there? Oh, my God. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=579.4000000000001s)]
*  Look, it's a fake train station. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=581.96s)]
*  Now, to be clear, this is not a real train station. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=586.2s)]
*  There are no railroad tracks that lead into or out of this thing that looks like a little rail station. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=588.9200000000001s)]
*  It's like I see the benches and everything and the little lamps. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=594.48s)]
*  It's a it's a replica, a train station replica. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=597.2800000000001s)]
*  But sitting on the fake tracks at the fake train station in this guy's yard is a fake train car, a personal fake train car. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=601.12s)]
*  And look, these guys, it's so sweet. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=609.84s)]
*  They put on plastic boot covers so they won't mess up the carpet when they go in. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=611.24s)]
*  But then they go in and look at it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=615.4s)]
*  This train car, it's like the Orient Express. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=617.64s)]
*  It's all red velvet and hand carved hardwood and gold. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=620.48s)]
*  Everything that looks gold actually is gold. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  And this isn't like some lovingly restored antique because this guy just loves the classic era of train travel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=628.08s)]
*  And, you know, some rich guy rescued and restored this old train car. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=633.96s)]
*  No, this is apparently a newly built thing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=637.12s)]
*  It's a fake Pullman train car inside a fake train station stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gold fittings and expensive silver. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=640.28s)]
*  The coffee machine is gold plated. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=651.84s)]
*  The crystal tumblers have the seal of the Russian Federation on them. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=655.04s)]
*  And you know this is coming. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=660.56s)]
*  You know this is you know this is coming. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=661.6s)]
*  Yes, there is a gold toilet with a gold holder for the toilet brush. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  There's a gold hose on the bidet, which is like a little little rinsy thing for your business end. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=669.48s)]
*  Does the hose for that really have to be gold given its function? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=677.04s)]
*  Really? Yes. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=680.8s)]
*  Yes. Everything must be gold. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  Including the thing you squirt. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=684.08s)]
*  This is just astonishing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=686.6s)]
*  I mean this this astonishment. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=689.44s)]
*  This thing with the gold everything and the stained glass ceiling inside the fake rail car and the gold crests everywhere that are real gold. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=692.36s)]
*  This belongs to this gentleman. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=703.84s)]
*  His name is Victor Medvedchuk. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=707.48s)]
*  He is now under arrest in Ukraine, having previously been charged with treason. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=710.24s)]
*  This train car parked in his yard in the fake train station parked in his yard was reportedly a gift from his wife sometime last year, a birthday present, a little special thing for him to play with. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=715.8s)]
*  Victor Medvedchuk. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=727.16s)]
*  Do you by any chance remember that when candidate Donald Trump hired a campaign chairman in 2016, for whatever reason, he chose this guy, Paul Manafort, a man with whom he had no prior relationship. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=729.04s)]
*  Paul Manafort, for years, had been working overseas, getting paid by Putin connected corrupt oligarchs to install Putin connected corrupt politicians in positions of power in the nation of Ukraine. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=741.68s)]
*  That that book I wrote called Blowout is about how Putin weaponized oil and gas and corruption to try to keep Ukraine and other neighboring countries weak and dependent on Russia and under Putin's thumb. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=755.2s)]
*  Well, when Donald Trump inexplicably hired Manafort to run his campaign in 2016, that was what Paul Manafort specialized in. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=767.76s)]
*  Weakening other countries by installing compromised, corrupt Russian puppets who would do Putin's bidding in the political leadership of other countries. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=775.64s)]
*  Right. That was what he was doing for a living. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=784.4s)]
*  And then Trump hired him. Weird. Why would we want that in America? What a weird skill set to bring to an American campaign. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=787.7199999999999s)]
*  Anyway, but in Ukraine, in his work in Ukraine, Manafort's most famous client was the Ukrainian prime minister. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=795.04s)]
*  He got elected there. A pro-Putin puppet named Yanukovych. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=802.04s)]
*  Yanukovych, you might remember, fled to Moscow when Ukrainians rose up and threw him out of office. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=806.04s)]
*  And you might remember from segments here on this show that after Yanukovych fled, the Ukrainian people started going into his various houses and palaces that he had all over Ukraine. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=811.04s)]
*  And that's how they learned that he too had gold toilets. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=822.04s)]
*  What is it with these guys? At least Yanukovych had a toilet with weird gold, like lizard feet and a gold flusher and yes, a gold bidet for the squirting. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=826.04s)]
*  Yanukovych also had a private zoo. In his case, he didn't have a fake gold plated personal train car like Medvedchuk. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=838.04s)]
*  Yanukovych instead had a fake gold plated personal Spanish galleon. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=846.04s)]
*  That he floated on his private lake and used as his own private restaurant. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=852.04s)]
*  Classy these guys. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=857.04s)]
*  Oh, well, Yanukovych is gone, fled back to Moscow. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=859.04s)]
*  And now it's Viktor Medvedchuk, the man with the gold plated fake train car, who's as of this week under arrest in Ukraine for treason. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=862.04s)]
*  He was also one of Paul Manafort's guys in Ukraine. Medvedchuk is one of the richest men in Ukraine. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=871.04s)]
*  He is linked obviously to the Russian government. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=877.04s)]
*  He has always worked for Putin's interests in Ukraine. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=880.04s)]
*  He was part of the whole operation that Manafort ran to install Putin connected puppets and positions of power in Ukraine. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=883.04s)]
*  Putin is godfather to one of Medvedchuk's daughters. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=890.04s)]
*  It was therefore unsettling when we learned that Medvedchuk had been one of the Trump campaign's contacts in 2016 when Russia was intervening in our election to try to help get Trump into the White House. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=893.04s)]
*  But now the Ukrainians have arrested Viktor Medvedchuk. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=906.04s)]
*  They have taken his assets, including the train car. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=909.04s)]
*  They've taken his assets and those of all the other oligarchs who are working for the Russian Federation inside Ukraine. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=913.04s)]
*  Ukraine announced today that just from Medvedchuk alone, they have seized 30 plots of land, 23 houses, 32 apartments, 26 cars and one yacht. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=919.04s)]
*  And presumably that one fake train car, it's bedazzled golden hose for squirting water up at the caboose. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=930.04s)]
*  Just as Russian oligarchs the world over are having their yachts seized and their assets frozen, Ukraine too is trying to free itself of what Russia has been doing to them by weaponizing corruption to create these powerful, rich, pro-Putin power centers inside their country. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=941.04s)]
*  To keep their country corrupt, weak, destabilized, dependent on Russia. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=960.04s)]
*  But today, a big new step. Today, Europe, the European Union, finally took the first step toward actually pulling the plug on Russia's power. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=967.04s)]
*  Toward actually dismantling Russia as a state. At least as the kind of state it is now. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=975.04s)]
*  Because the European Union today began drafting a measure that would ban the purchase of Russian oil and gas. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=981.04s)]
*  If there is one thing that could end Putin's Russia as we know it, it would be that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=988.04s)]
*  Will they really do it? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=994.04s)]
*  But I want to start us off tonight here at home with a headline that is maybe not a total surprise, but I think it has come sooner than any of us expected. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=998.04s)]
*  Here it is tonight from the Associated Press. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1007.04s)]
*  Quote, abortions stop in Kentucky as groups seek to block new law. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1010.04s)]
*  Just read that one more time. Abortions stop in Kentucky. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1016.04s)]
*  At the end of last month, Republicans in Kentucky passed a bill to make it harder for women to get an abortion in that state. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1020.04s)]
*  Previously, Kentucky had had a law in the books that said you couldn't get an abortion there if your pregnancy was more than 20 weeks along. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1027.04s)]
*  This new law passed last month rolled that back even further, said that you can no longer get an abortion in the state if your pregnancy is 15 weeks along or further. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1034.04s)]
*  So they rolled it back from 20 to 15 weeks. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1044.04s)]
*  And Kentucky Republicans, of course, they're not the first to pass that kind of legislation. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1047.04s)]
*  They won't be the last. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1051.04s)]
*  But unlike in most of the other states with with Republican controlled legislatures, Kentucky has a governor who is a Democrat. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1052.04s)]
*  And after the Kentucky Republicans passed that 15 week abortion ban through the legislature last month, the state's Democratic Governor, Andy Beshear, he vetoed it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1060.04s)]
*  Well, last night, the Republican legislature in Kentucky voted to override the governor's veto. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1068.04s)]
*  And the practical consequence of that is very important for our country because that means that that new abortion ban in Kentucky is now in effect. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1075.04s)]
*  There's no grace period. There's no sort of planned implementation date in the future for it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1085.04s)]
*  The law takes effect immediately. It's operational today, right now. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1090.04s)]
*  And it turns out it's much more than just a 15 week ban. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1095.04s)]
*  There's already only two clinics that provide abortions in the whole state of Kentucky. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1100.04s)]
*  They're both located in Louisville. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1104.04s)]
*  Tonight, both of those clinics say that because of the way this law is written, not just because the 15 week ban, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1106.04s)]
*  but because of the other restrictions in the bill that are designed to make it basically impossible for anybody to legally provide any abortion in the state. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1112.04s)]
*  Both of those clinics, the last two clinics in the state tell us tonight that there is no way for them to comply with this new law, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1121.04s)]
*  which again went into effect today with the veto override. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1128.04s)]
*  And so the last two clinics in Kentucky are announcing that as of now, they have had to close their doors. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1132.04s)]
*  They are no longer able to provide abortions because of this new law as of today, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1139.04s)]
*  which means if we're talking about landmarks, today is a landmark because today for the first time since Roe versus Wade, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1144.04s)]
*  Supreme Court decision in 1973, today, the first American state has gone dark to outright block all legal access to abortions in the state. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1153.04s)]
*  Full stop. Kentucky is the first one. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1165.04s)]
*  It's the first state with no legal access to abortion since Roe versus Wade in 1973. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-Y5RE446d4&t=1168.04s)]
