# DOJ Adds Prosecutor To Investigate January 6 Beyond The Capitol Attack: NYT
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc)
*  Alan Foer joins us now live. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Foer, I know you don't particularly relish being on TV to talk about your reporting. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=2.36s)]
*  It makes me all the more grateful for you being here with us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=8.96s)]
*  Oh, well, thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=9.96s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=12.16s)]
*  Let me ask you first about this reporting, about the prosecutor who's been in charge—put [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=13.16s)]
*  in charge of this part of the January 6th investigation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=18.44s)]
*  What can you tell us about him and what exactly he's looking at that's different than all [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=22.6s)]
*  of the other prosecutors who have been at work on these cases? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=26.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=29.72s)]
*  So, he was—his name is Tom Wyndham. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=30.72s)]
*  He was brought in from Maryland. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=33.4s)]
*  He's a career prosecutor, and although I don't know him personally, by all accounts, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  he's a kind of classic, you know, federal prosecutor type. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=40.72s)]
*  He's been described as diligent yet aggressive, sort of like forceful but cool under pressure. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  And his mandate is essentially to look at the question of whether or not there was criminal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=53.12s)]
*  activity related to January 6th that took place outside of the grounds of the Capitol. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=60.36s)]
*  As you said in your introduction, the Justice Department has been focused almost exclusively [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=68.0s)]
*  for more than a year on people who physically stormed the building. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=74.74s)]
*  They went in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=79.4s)]
*  They broke windows. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=80.4s)]
*  They got involved with cops. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=81.48s)]
*  Or maybe they didn't. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=82.48s)]
*  They just trespassed and entered restricted areas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=83.48s)]
*  But there's a whole other group of people who were involved in the political rally at [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=87.12s)]
*  the ellipse, Donald Trump's ellipse event, that preceded that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  These are political organizers, speakers, sort of people described as VIPs, members [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  of Congress who were involved in that event, people within the Trump administration who [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=105.68s)]
*  were involved in that event. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=110.56s)]
*  And the question is, did anything that they did help to kind of shape or inspire the violence [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=111.56s)]
*  and chaos that ultimately erupted? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=121.12s)]
*  And that's what Thomas Windham has been brought in to look at, to answer that question. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=123.44s)]
*  Are these, is this a seditious conspiracy question? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Is this the kind of potential prosecution that we have seen around, for example, the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=133.58s)]
*  Oath Keepers and those guys? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Or is this a different set of potential charges? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=139.96s)]
*  I don't know, frankly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=145.88s)]
*  But if I had to say, the seditious conspiracy charge that the Oath Keepers are facing, I [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=147.32s)]
*  think is specifically related to the issue of the weapons that they had stored across [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=155.56s)]
*  the river in Virginia, allegedly waiting to be brought into play when needed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=162.2s)]
*  If you look at things that, say, Representative Liz Cheney has said on the floor of the House [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=170.28s)]
*  about the behavior of former President Trump and others, the idea is that perhaps the charge [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=180.48s)]
*  here that may ultimately arise is a conspiracy to obstruct Congress and the work of Congress. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=188.6s)]
*  And that has been the Justice Department's kind of go-to charge to describe the very [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=199.24s)]
*  unique political crime that was committed on January 6th, which is simply that by obstructing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  the peaceful transition of power, that was the crime that was committed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=218.28s)]
*  So look, we don't know what charge, if any, may ultimately be brought. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=224.12s)]
*  But everything kind of points towards the notion of, was there an effort to kind of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  obstruct the work of Congress right at the moment when lawmakers were doing the very [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  crucial work of certifying the final results of the election? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=243.16s)]
*  Does Mr. Wyndham have a team? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=248.68s)]
*  Does he have considerable resources for this work? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=254.72s)]
*  The short answer to that is there doesn't seem to be a big team yet. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=257.56s)]
*  That said, we do know that, you know, at least one subpoena has gone out, and he's kind of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=263.9s)]
*  overseeing that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=272.14000000000004s)]
*  Ali Alexander, as you mentioned in your introduction, has been subpoenaed, and Wyndham is kind of, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=273.14000000000004s)]
*  you know, shepherding that subpoena. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  Whether or not there will be more people assigned to his particular team remains to be seen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  Don't forget, there are 140 federal prosecutors sort of assigned to the investigation writ [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=290.54s)]
*  large. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=298.5s)]
*  And so the job here is to see what is the nexus between the people who are on the ground [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=299.70000000000005s)]
*  and the people who were away from the Capitol grounds. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=308.12s)]
*  You know, like, I kind of think of it as suits and boots, in a way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=311.18s)]
*  And so a guy like Thomas Wyndham is presumably working closely with other federal prosecutors [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=315.54s)]
*  who are kind of steeped in the boots on the ground cases. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, we'll see kind of where that goes, you know, as the days and weeks go on. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=328.22s)]
*  Let me just ask you about what I described as the sort of cynicism, the sort of healthy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=336.22s)]
*  skepticism about the attorney general saying that everybody involved at every level will [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=339.5s)]
*  face accountability here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=344.54s)]
*  What's your just bigger picture view as to whether or not the Justice Department is willing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=346.54s)]
*  to make even politically fraught determinations if that's where these—that's where the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  suits part of this suits and boots investigation, as you describe it, might lead? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=356.9s)]
*  Look, I mean, you quoted Attorney General Garland in your introduction. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=360.9s)]
*  You know, he has said he's going to follow the evidence where it goes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=366.7s)]
*  If you look at the case filings, right, it's very, very clear and has been from before [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=370.26s)]
*  the emergence of this kind of, you know, expanded vision of this case that the Justice Department [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=377.94s)]
*  is very homed in on what effect former President Trump's words and actions had on people on [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=384.02000000000004s)]
*  the ground. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=393.90000000000003s)]
*  It's apparent in charging documents. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  It's apparent in what are called statements of offense when people plead guilty. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=397.82s)]
*  It's just very clear, if you pay attention to the paperwork, that the Justice Department [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=403.06s)]
*  is aware of the effect that Trump's words had on people on the ground. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=408.28s)]
*  So, you know, whether that results in a criminal case, that's just not something that we [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=414.44s)]
*  can tell at the moment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=420.52s)]
*  I would be surprised if the Justice Department knew at the moment. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  But in terms of whether or not they are paying attention to it, it's very clear they are. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=425.28s)]
*  Now we know for certain that the Justice Department has kind of expanded its gaze, so to speak, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=432.28s)]
*  and like looked beyond people who were on the ground that day to those who were off [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=440.28s)]
*  site but may have some sort of culpability. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0bhnwlTHgc&t=446.0s)]
