# Elon Musk seen as working counter to U.S. interests in dealings with Russia, China
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ)
*  Joining us now is Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, my friend Ronan Farrow, investigative reporter and contributing writer for The New Yorker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Farrow's recently published piece on this subject for The New Yorker is called Elon Musk's Shadow Rule. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Ronan, thank you very much for making time to be here tonight. I really appreciate it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=16.0s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if I have characterized your reporting correctly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=18.0s)]
*  I know that both you and Mr. Isaacson and reporter for The Economist and some other people have gotten to different pieces of this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=23.0s)]
*  What I see is sort of the same story. Did I characterize your reporting accurately? Did you see it sort of the way I presented it? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=30.0s)]
*  You did, and I always respect how you give viewers the timeline of everyone who contributed to our understanding. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=37.0s)]
*  I'd also point out the Financial Times as this was happening was doing good leading reporting about the outages in terms of coverage on the Ukrainian front lines. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=43.0s)]
*  I talked to not just the officials you mentioned, but also Ukrainian soldiers on the ground who had the experience personally of being shocked as they attempted to advance in some of these critical areas where Russia was attempting to seize control and as they lost the ability for commanders to communicate with troops on the front lines. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=52.0s)]
*  So, you know, there are varying opinions about how directly that contributed to, for instance, potential loss of life. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=70.0s)]
*  But everyone around this seems to agree what happened is as you rendered it and that there was a grievous consequence for people on the ground. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=76.0s)]
*  I want to talk specifically about Mr. Musk's communications with the Russian government. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=84.0s)]
*  As you point out in The New Yorker, and you're right, there's nothing illegal about an American private citizen talking to a foreign government that said it's not exactly legal for American private citizens to conduct their own foreign policy contrary to the interests of stated US foreign policy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=91.0s)]
*  But we're sort of in the we're sort of in that within within those those those bounds, I think a little bit in trying to figure this out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=105.0s)]
*  You reported that Mr. Musk has had direct conversations with with Russian officials. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=113.0s)]
*  We have seen Mr. Musk post very obviously pro-Russian propaganda after these conversations. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=119.0s)]
*  You connect that communication. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Apparently, Mr. Isaacson connects that communication as well in time to Mr. Musk's decision to cut off this crucial communications asset for the Ukrainian military. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=130.0s)]
*  What do you understand about his communication with with Russia? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=139.0s)]
*  The timeline is fairly straightforward here, Rachel, and we have abundant evidence about it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=143.0s)]
*  Elon Musk very often likes to identify problems in the world and swoop in and try to solve them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=147.0s)]
*  But he has a lot of upside to that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=154.0s)]
*  NASA's reliance on him is also an antidote to a situation where we literally had no way to launch American astronauts into space unless the Russians launched for us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=156.0s)]
*  So there are positives to this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=165.0s)]
*  However, what we saw in the Ukraine case was Elon Musk swooped in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=167.0s)]
*  He was tweeting with Ukrainian officials. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=170.0s)]
*  He was saying Starlink is on the way. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=172.0s)]
*  Then over the ensuing months, I think he clocked the price tag of this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=174.0s)]
*  And there appears to have been an ideological shift where at conferences and in other settings and as you say, even eventually on Twitter, he started, for instance, putting out public peace plans that accorded exactly with what the Russians wanted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=179.0s)]
*  New referendums that might redraw the lines in favor of Russia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=192.0s)]
*  He started tweeting out information that the Russians often point to, namely that there are areas around Ukraine's borders in which the local population, they like to say, would prefer Russian rule. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=196.0s)]
*  That's something that Elon Musk parroted. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=206.0s)]
*  So we see all of this that's public facing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Then we have the fact from multiple people now that he was in many conversations, it appears, with Russian officials and at least one with Vladimir Putin himself later. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=211.0s)]
*  As you pointed out, he denied that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=221.0s)]
*  But that does seem to be the case. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=223.0s)]
*  And you cited a paragraph where there are unnamed officials saying that I would point out there is also on the record, people saying that Colin Collette, you know, senior defense official is very respected, is on the record in this piece talking about this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=225.0s)]
*  Talking about the conversation you mentioned in which Elon Musk was watching that map and said, I talked to Vladimir Putin, not in another time, as he's later claimed, not about an unrelated thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=237.0s)]
*  Very clearly implying about this in this time frame. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=247.0s)]
*  Well, the other thing that's so unnerving about that section of your reporting is just the idea of what Mr. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=251.0s)]
*  Musk describes on the phone. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Elon Musk said he was looking at his laptop and could see, quote, the entire war unfolding through a map of Scarlink activity. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=262.0s)]
*  So if you've got anybody in the world, I don't care what nationality you are, but if you've got somebody who is saying that he's having direct conversations with Vladimir Putin, who is saying, according to lots of good reporting, that he is talking to the Russian government regularly and senior officials in the Russian government. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=269.0s)]
*  And he simultaneously has access to information that shows, in his words, the entire war unfolding in terms of what the Ukrainian government is doing, what Ukrainian units are doing all over that active war zone. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=285.0s)]
*  That's a very, very dangerous potential conduit of information just in terms of the conduct of the war. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=299.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the biggest intelligence risk you could possibly imagine in terms of whether or not Ukraine's ever going to be able to win this thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=306.0s)]
*  Needless to say, Rachel, this is of grave concern to Ukrainians, to American defense officials watching this conflict and trying to advance American interests in the region. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=313.0s)]
*  You mentioned that regardless of the legal lines, it is a unique phenomenon and potentially a problem when a private individual is brokering foreign policy like this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=322.0s)]
*  Elon Musk does have many of the powers of a state. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=332.0s)]
*  He goes on diplomatic missions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=334.0s)]
*  He poses for the kind of awkward smiling handshake photos with foreign officials, including Chinese officials that we usually associate with elected officials. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=336.0s)]
*  And we have American officials treating him like an elected official because his power is unavoidable in these areas. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=344.0s)]
*  And Elon Musk is also a good lens to reach to view the perils of that because there's a lot of good he does. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=350.0s)]
*  There's a lot of ways in which he's smart. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=355.0s)]
*  But we also see a radical behavior. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=357.0s)]
*  We also see how, as you mentioned in the kind of radicalism he's displayed on Twitter, he does have a tendency to absorb and carry water for new views that he didn't espouse previously very rapidly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=358.0s)]
*  And in this case, he's also an individual who is buffeted by headwinds of incentives around his businesses and where they operate that are not always aligned with American interests. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=370.0s)]
*  So, for instance, half of all of Tesla's vehicles are produced in a Shanghai factory. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=380.0s)]
*  That means he has to be in diplomatic conversations with Beijing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=386.0s)]
*  And he's a fairly transparent guy in some ways. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=390.0s)]
*  It's not clear that all of his statements around this have always been accurate, like the Putin comments. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=394.0s)]
*  However, he talks about it a lot. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=399.0s)]
*  He goes in interviews with the Financial Times in one case and comes out and says, I talked to the Chinese. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=401.0s)]
*  They're mad about me giving Internet access in Ukraine because, remember, the Chinese have backed the Russians in this conflict. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=407.0s)]
*  And they're fearful of that kind of free Internet technology being given to their own people. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=413.0s)]
*  So he's dealt with blowback for the Ukrainian support because of his unique geopolitical position. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=417.0s)]
*  And that does underscore how dangerous it is to concentrate all of this power in the hands of private billionaires with their own interests. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=423.0s)]
*  Right. And it raises the question if he's being pressured and advised by the Chinese and the Russians, what's the relationship of the U.S. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=431.0s)]
*  government to him, particularly when he's conducting effectively foreign policy against the interests of state US state US policy Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Ronan Farrell. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=439.0s)]
*  Ronan, thank you for this reporting. Thanks for talking with us about it tonight. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=451.0s)]
*  It's good to see you. Thanks for all you do, Rachel. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=454.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK2eKWk_SkQ&t=469.0s)]
