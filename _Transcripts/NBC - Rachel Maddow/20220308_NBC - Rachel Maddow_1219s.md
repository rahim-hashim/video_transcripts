# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 7
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE)
*  This was the Associated Press headline on November 13, 1959. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=0.0s)]
*  Dateline Berlin. East Germans jail buyers of blue jeans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=5.36s)]
*  The East German communists have jailed a teenager for two months because he bought blue jeans in West Berlin. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=10.24s)]
*  The judge told the 18-year-old that the sentence would, quote, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=17.2s)]
*  serve as a warning to certain young people who ardently want blue jeans or rock and roll, end quote. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=20.72s)]
*  Throughout the Cold War, blue jeans and in particular Levi's blue jeans were a coveted and at times [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=29.84s)]
*  forbidden item in the Soviet Union. But Soviet teens demanded Levi's, so much so that Levi's jeans [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=35.28s)]
*  started getting smuggled into the Soviet Union like narcotics. They were sold for outrageous prices. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Now to stop the smuggling, the East German government first tried to manufacture their own [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=49.2s)]
*  that didn't work. Then the government bulk purchased almost 800,000 pairs of Levi's jeans [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  and had them literally airlifted from the United States so that they could start distributing them [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=60.56s)]
*  right away. Well today, once again in 2022, Levi's jeans have halted their sales in Russia, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=65.12s)]
*  joining a growing chorus of companies. Disney, Warner Brothers, Sony, Universal, Paramount, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  all stopping film releases in Russia. Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, HP, and Intel, all stopping new [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=77.36s)]
*  sales. Netflix has pulled out. TikTok won't allow new posts by Russian users. Flying out of Russia [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=83.92s)]
*  is nearly impossible now, as is buying anything with major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=90.0s)]
*  or American Express, all of which in addition to punishing Western sanctions takes a toll. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=95.36s)]
*  Try taking a Disney movie away from a kid or an iPhone away from a teenager. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=102.56s)]
*  In addition to a massive ground stop on Western goods and services, the Russian economy is showing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  real strain. Russian interest rates are now 20 percent. The ruble, worth less than a penny. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=112.4s)]
*  Massive inflation. Russian state media is doing its best to put a positive spin on this invasion [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  of Ukraine, except you can't call it an invasion in Russia. It's called a special military operation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=124.4s)]
*  But even Russian citizens who are fully bought into the state-sponsored narrative are going to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=130.4s)]
*  have trouble squaring up what that means and why they can't use their MasterCard anymore, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=134.64s)]
*  and why they're running out of food at shops, and why their money's worth nothing if this is just a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=139.68s)]
*  special military operation in Ukraine. A large section of the Russian population is also old [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=144.16s)]
*  enough to remember the Cold War and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and what both of those [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=150.16s)]
*  things did to their economy and how it all led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=154.64s)]
*  You've already seen more than 13,000 anti-war protesters arrested across Russia. That unrest [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  seems to be building despite the massive increased risk associated with protesting because of a new [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=167.92s)]
*  law that's been put into place. Is the broader Russian population, including many that support [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  Putin, actually going to accept a costly war of choice against a neighbor and the resulting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=179.52s)]
*  economic deprivation? Or is it possible that at some point Vladimir Putin and the Russian [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=186.16s)]
*  government could lose control of the Russian people? Joining us now, Ian Bremmer, president [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=190.8s)]
*  of the Eurasia Group, a leading global political risk research and consulting firm. Ian, thank you [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=197.04s)]
*  for being here. You have studied this more than most. Let's just talk about this. Let's say you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=201.6s)]
*  can't get the real information. You're in Russia and for whatever reason, everything you read [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=206.8s)]
*  follows the official line that this is a strategic operation in Ukraine. It's not a war. It's not an [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=212.0s)]
*  invasion. But suddenly your credit cards don't work and you can't buy stuff and you can't use [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=220.8s)]
*  stuff and you can't see stuff and things aren't available on the shelves and your interest rates [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=225.12s)]
*  are 20% and your money's not worth anything. At some point, people are going to say, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=229.52s)]
*  this official storyline doesn't jive with my life. Some people are, Ali, but most people are not. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=233.84s)]
*  Some people are going to be primarily young, educated, literate and online, at least previously [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=242.4s)]
*  online, given how much is being shut down right now by Russia in major cities. But the majority [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=250.0s)]
*  of the population is overwhelmingly fed information through state media. That's television, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=256.0s)]
*  it's newspapers, it's not digital. The level of support for Putin has historically been [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=264.56s)]
*  exceptionally strong among this group and is going to continue to be. If you think that the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=270.0s)]
*  United States is incredibly divided and that people only follow news and cable and social media that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=274.48s)]
*  they agree with, that is literally exponentially less than what you're experiencing in Russia right [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=280.64s)]
*  now. And we have to be aware of that even as the Russian economy starts to crater, which it will [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=286.32s)]
*  do in spectacular fashion in the coming days. But the Russian economy cratering and some of that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=292.96s)]
*  was in part due to how much money that the USSR was spending in Afghanistan and the body bags and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=301.76s)]
*  people coming back dead. But a lot of it was the economy. It was how bad things were for the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=310.16s)]
*  Russian people, which prompted them to throw off their systems, their political systems back then. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=315.6s)]
*  Why wouldn't the same thing happen now when people are frustrated that 30 years of economic [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=322.4s)]
*  and to some degree political gains seem to be evaporating in front of their eyes? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=327.44s)]
*  Because a lot of the reasons that Russians believe, again Putin supporting Russians, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=332.72s)]
*  which is not the whole population, but a solid 60 to 70 percent, the reason why they believe the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=338.24s)]
*  country has fallen into disarray, they don't blame Putin. They blame things like shock therapy. They [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=343.44s)]
*  blame NATO enlargement. They blame the West. And so when they hear from the Kremlin that the reason [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=350.16s)]
*  that the Russian economy is cratering is because of a war that the Ukrainians have started or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=356.32s)]
*  special military operations that are happening because the Russians were about to launch a war [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=362.56s)]
*  or because they were committing genocide against Russians in the occupied territories, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=367.2s)]
*  absolutely verifiably false, but completely what the Russian, the Kremlin narrative has been now [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=371.2s)]
*  for months across Russia, they're going to buy it. I mean, come on. We've got a still a strong [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=377.12s)]
*  majority in the United States of people that voted for Trump that believe that the election was fake [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=384.32s)]
*  and in fact a strong minority that believe that he should be returned to power immediately through [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=390.64s)]
*  violence if necessary. That's the United States. That's a wealthy comparatively educated country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=395.52s)]
*  In Russia, Ali, this is vastly more dysfunctional and you just have to appreciate that Putin does [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=400.32s)]
*  have the capacity to drive that narrative even in the case of what's going to be a much worse [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  economic collapse than what anyone in the United States has been experiencing for really a century. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=415.28s)]
*  What's the blowback on the rest of the world? We've already seen oil prices topping 125 bucks a barrel. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=421.36s)]
*  There are a whole bunch of people tweeting me today that they have filled up for more than $4 a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=428.32s)]
*  gallon. We are seeing, we are approaching some of the highest prices for oil and gasoline that we've [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=432.24s)]
*  seen in a while. That's going to happen all over the world. What else happens if this continues? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=437.68s)]
*  It's probably about a 1% contraction in global GDP that we'll experience in the United States [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=443.44s)]
*  and in Europe. It's a lot more persistent inflation. Its supply chains being more severed [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=450.8s)]
*  and more challenging, so a lot longer time for you to get whatever it is you're trying to order. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  But that's really not the suffering. The suffering are the poorest. It's a combination of, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=462.56s)]
*  we've seen about 60 million people die of starvation in the last 12 months around the world, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=468.88s)]
*  which is higher in the pandemic than it was before the pandemic. That's going to get a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=473.52s)]
*  hell of a lot worse. Ali, you've just had the largest grain producer in the world invade the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=477.12s)]
*  fifth largest grain producer in the world. This is going to cause enormous challenges for the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=482.96s)]
*  poorest people in the world who already don't get enough to eat. It's Sub-Saharan Africa. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=489.28s)]
*  It's Yemen. It's Afghanistan. Also, emerging markets that are seriously indebted and don't [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=493.44s)]
*  have access to credit are going to be in much more trouble here. The potential for a financial [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=500.56s)]
*  crisis in Turkey, for example, a lot of other medium income emerging markets that have lived [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=505.2s)]
*  through two years of pandemic but have nowhere near the capacity to make their middle classes whole [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=511.04s)]
*  the way the Americans or the Europeans have through the pandemic, they're going to get [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=516.24s)]
*  smashed right now. So it's really global inequality. The last 40 years, globalization [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=520.08s)]
*  has driven the emergence of a global middle class. The pandemic and now even worse, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=524.88s)]
*  this Russia-Ukraine crisis is going to force all of those people around the world to take it on the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=530.72s)]
*  chin. President Zelensky released this video today showing him back in his presidential office in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=535.6s)]
*  Kiev for the first time since the war began, not in the fortified bunker that he's usually been [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=543.12s)]
*  broadcasting from. Zelensky is putting all the pressure he can on the United States and NATO [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=549.36s)]
*  to give his country more help. He's going to address the British House of Commons via live [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  video conference tomorrow. This weekend, he spoke with more than 200 members of the U.S. House and [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=560.24s)]
*  Senate. When asked what he needs most, Zelensky reportedly told the lawmakers he needs jet [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=566.24s)]
*  fighters. The catch, though, is that Ukrainian pilots don't know how to fly American jets. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=572.0s)]
*  As a former Soviet republic, they fly Russian MiG fighter jets. And so one idea being floated is that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=579.6s)]
*  Poland would give Ukraine some of its old Soviet-made MiGs, and the United States would [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=586.48s)]
*  then give Poland, which is a NATO ally, American jets to replace them, like F-16s. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=592.96s)]
*  We're looking actively now at the question of airplanes that Poland may provide to Ukraine. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=600.96s)]
*  And looking at how we might be able to backfill should Poland decide to supply those planes. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=608.96s)]
*  Society is more complicated than it sounds, by the way. The U.S. and its NATO allies are trying [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=618.0s)]
*  to give Ukraine as much help as they can without actually getting into a war with Russia, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=622.24s)]
*  without becoming a so-called co-combatant in the conflict. And no one can really say for certain [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=626.48s)]
*  where that actual line is. As one senior American national security official warned The New York [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=632.0s)]
*  Times this weekend, the American legal definitions of what constitutes entering the war [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=637.76s)]
*  are not the same as Vladimir Putin's definitions. For instance, the Kremlin has warned NATO countries [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=642.88s)]
*  against letting themselves be used as bases for Ukraine's remaining air force, saying that if [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=649.04s)]
*  Ukrainian planes attack Russian forces from a NATO country, Russia is going to consider [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=654.96s)]
*  that country part of the conflict. So Poland is understandably nervous about this plane swap idea. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=660.0s)]
*  Ukrainian planes wouldn't be attacking Russians from Poland, but Poland would be giving the planes [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=667.76s)]
*  to the Ukrainian air force. So would Russia then consider Poland a co-combatant? Here in Hungary, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  whose president has been vocally pro-Putin right until Putin invaded Ukraine, Hungary's kind of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=679.68s)]
*  split the difference. They're allowing NATO troops to be stationed in this country, not anywhere near [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  me. They've got to be west of the Danube River near Budapest. But they will not allow weapons to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=691.6s)]

*  Hungary, but they cannot cross into Ukraine, a thousand feet from where I am, from this country. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=702.96s)]
*  They've got to go into a third country first. My team shot this footage today in a town just a few [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=709.84s)]
*  miles from here. The Hungarian military beefing up its presence near the border, clearly preparing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  for something. We actually tried to bring you this show tonight from their barracks. They initially [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=721.2s)]
*  agreed and then they respectfully declined, offering to help us find other locations from which to do [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=727.36s)]
*  the show. So we return to a place we know, this tiny village center, where it's lights out. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=732.0s)]
*  Refugees arrive, as you can see, by the busload about every hour. Okay, I want to go back to these [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=738.0s)]
*  jets again. Whether the U.S. ends up finding a way to get fighter jets to Ukraine, the scale of the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=744.32s)]
*  other weaponry that they have managed to get to the Ukrainian military in recent days is staggering. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=750.4s)]
*  The New York Times and CNN report that the U.S. and NATO have delivered 17,000 Javelin anti-tank [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=756.4s)]
*  weapons, 2,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles in less than a week, unloading them from giant cargo [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  planes in Poland and Romania, where they are transported across the border by land. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=771.04s)]
*  They were running for their lives, frantically trying to keep their families together amid the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=777.12s)]
*  mayhem and gunfire, desperately handing over their toddlers to soldiers and strangers, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=784.88s)]
*  scrambling to get away from the firing and shelling, even as they fled. Many have spent [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=791.12s)]
*  days under fire, trapped in their homes until they realized it was run or die, with the Russians [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=796.56s)]
*  getting closer. The stream of people fleeing are traumatized, but many are also angry and full of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=802.4s)]
*  despair. Putin's a war criminal, she says, the antichrist. You've been waiting for him, now you've [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=810.9599999999999s)]
*  got him. Families have been torn apart in the chaos. They ran into Erpin from a village outside [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=817.6s)]
*  before escaping Erpin too, and they've left elderly relatives behind. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=824.0799999999999s)]
*  All houses are in fire and that's all that they can see. How much destruction is there that you [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=828.72s)]
*  can see in the town center? I think all destroyed. There is nothing to help, there is nothing to build [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=834.32s)]
*  or defend. There is nothing. I came here and I left my parents to die, she tells us, and I told my [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=842.4s)]
*  husband, you've got to go back and bring them here because I can't just leave them to die. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=851.36s)]
*  But in amongst this suffering and trauma, there are small glimpses of hope. Her 81-year-old mother [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=855.92s)]
*  and father are found. And the family is reunited. How could I live without you, she says. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  There is incredible heartache and fear, but also an astonishing defiance about the people who have [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=870.88s)]
*  been left behind. Alex Crawford, Sky News in Erpin. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=878.88s)]
*  That was Alex Crawford reporting from Erpin, a small town northwest of Kyiv, where Ukrainian [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=891.6s)]
*  families have been fleeing amid heavy Russian shelling. Those families, if they are lucky, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=896.72s)]
*  will join the war more than 1.7 million refugees, mostly women and children, who have fled Ukraine [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=901.28s)]
*  since Russia began its invasion 12 days ago. All this migration in less than two weeks makes this [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=907.52s)]
*  the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, according to the UN High [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  Commissioner for Refugees. And with Russia potentially targeting more population centers [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=918.72s)]
*  across the country, millions more Ukrainian refugees will likely flee and need some place to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=923.52s)]
*  stay. Refugees like this 11-year-old Ukrainian boy named Hassan, who arrived at the Slovakian border [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=929.1999999999999s)]
*  alone this weekend. He traveled about 600 miles by himself with only a backpack, a plastic bag, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=936.24s)]
*  his passport, and more importantly, a phone number written on the back of his hand. The Slovakian [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=942.72s)]
*  Ministry of the Interior says that volunteers were able to use that phone number to reach the boy's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  relatives who arrived to pick him up. Today, Hassan met with the Interior Minister of Slovakia, who [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=953.04s)]
*  says the young boy has already sought temporary protection in the country. Slovakian officials [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=958.8s)]
*  called him a hero for making that long journey, and there are millions more like him trying to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=964.08s)]
*  make their trek to safety too. Meanwhile, here near Hungary's border with Ukraine, we're also [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=968.72s)]
*  seeing an influx of refugees. I got a chance to speak with some of them and with their [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  humanitarians who are coming to their aid. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=978.72s)]
*  Here, smoke rises from chimneys that were new a century ago. The tiny village of Tichabek, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=983.6s)]
*  Hungary sits just across the river from a now war-torn Ukraine. But as refugees pour out of [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=989.44s)]
*  these buses, it might as well be a world apart. I feel that I don't have a home because somebody [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=995.6800000000001s)]
*  thinks that they just can take our country. It's not normal. We need to do something. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1004.24s)]
*  I really wanted to stay in Ukraine. I love Ukraine. It's my home, but I can't. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1012.08s)]
*  A home both unsafe and for now unreachable. Friends Svetlana Paolo and Oylina Hradek [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1021.44s)]
*  met in Kyiv. Oylina hails from the Donbas region. No stranger to fighting, but fighting that hadn't [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1028.56s)]
*  touched her home until two weeks ago. My part of Donbas, it's Ukraine. But now, Russian military [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1035.12s)]
*  come to my home. And now I don't know what happened to what will happen to my mom, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1047.84s)]
*  with my grandma, with my two grandma tomorrow, today, right now. I don't know because [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1056.2399999999998s)]
*  they can't call them. Yeah, because they don't have internet, lights, all. She shares a story [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1062.8s)]
*  with nearly every person stepping off these buses. The faces are mostly women and children. The men [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1074.32s)]
*  had to stay and take up arms in Ukraine. A corner of this quiet village now bustles with activity. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1079.76s)]
*  To show the refugees, they are welcome here. Hungary hasn't been so friendly recently to [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1085.68s)]
*  outsiders, but not this time. A pop-up barbecue stand here to wave a friendly hello, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1090.96s)]
*  and some of these helpers arrived only to realize they needed to stay. They showed me pictures about [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  their city and about the street. They don't have house anymore. It has been bombed. Gabor Prokai [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1105.92s)]
*  came to drop off supplies from another distant village. He stayed for nine days. You can't [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1113.5200000000002s)]
*  prepare yourself for this. You can't. You won't solve everything and every people's life, but [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1119.68s)]
*  you have to do one day four or five tasks, which is done. And if it's okay, then your soul, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1130.16s)]
*  your soul maybe will be okay. Most of the people with whom we spoke planned to go someplace else [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1140.64s)]
*  in Europe. None planned to stay. There is only one place they want to be. Do you want to go home? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1148.8s)]
*  Yeah, of course. I want to see my family. It's my family. We're going now to the Budapest and then [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1155.2s)]
*  we will make our cat's passport and then we will get to the airport. I know maybe tomorrow or [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1165.2s)]
*  in two days, three days. And no, do you believe that you can go home? Of course. I believe it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1176.96s)]
*  Of course, I believe it. A young Ukrainian refugee keeping hope alive that she will one day be able [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1186.64s)]
*  to return to her home. We'll be right back. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7ugxladHFE&t=1191.92s)]
