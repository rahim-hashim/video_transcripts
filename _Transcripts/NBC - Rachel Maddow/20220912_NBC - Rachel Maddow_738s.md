# Former U.S. Attorney Details Trump, Barr Efforts To Corrupt DOJ With Political Agenda
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE)
*  Jeffrey Berman never gave a single interview while he was serving as U.S. attorney. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now he's a former U.S. attorney, and in his new book, he says that Bill Barr and Jeffrey [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=4.88s)]
*  Rosen and Rich Donahue and Edward O'Callaghan all participated in these sustained, very [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=9.88s)]
*  improper efforts by the Justice Department to corrupt federal law enforcement and to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=18.26s)]
*  corrupt the power of federal prosecution to help President Trump and respond to his whims [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=23.28s)]
*  and hurt his enemies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=28.06s)]
*  Berman also says he was removed from his office because something about his work as U.S. attorney [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=31.34s)]
*  threatened the reelection of the president in 2020. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  First of all, what was that? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=39.22s)]
*  But second of all, what do we do here? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=41.82s)]
*  What do we do with this? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=43.82s)]
*  I mean, it is a problem for us as a country that we elected a president who wanted to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=44.82s)]
*  use the Justice Department like this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=48.54s)]
*  We know that's a problem, I think. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=50.22s)]
*  One could argue, though, that it's an even bigger problem that there were all these senior [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  Justice Department officials who were happy to do it, who did it, who perverted not just [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=55.54s)]
*  investigations, but prosecutions and pleadings and sentences. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=61.62s)]
*  They actually did it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=66.3s)]
*  A corrupt man, a corrupt leader is a tragedy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=69.06s)]
*  A law enforcement agency that has proven itself to be corruptible, that needs to be fixed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=74.02s)]
*  This has to be fixed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=81.82s)]
*  I will tell you, tonight, since we have been on the air, the Senate Judiciary Committee [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  has just confirmed to us that they are launching an investigation into the claims made in Mr. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=89.02s)]
*  Berman's book. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  In a letter sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland tonight, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  and the number two Senate Democrat said, quote, These reported claims indicate astonishing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  and unacceptable deviations from the department's mission to pursue impartial justice, which [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  requires that its prosecutorial decisions be free from political influence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=108.34s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Committee has announced that it is launching this investigation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  Senator Durbin has told the Justice Department to hand over to the Judiciary Committee all [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=116.9s)]
*  documents and communications between DOJ and the Southern District of New York related [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=122.22s)]
*  to the Michael Cohen case, the John Kerry case, and the Gregory Craig case, as detailed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=128.06s)]
*  in Jeffrey Berman's brand new book. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=133.54s)]
*  Joining us now is Jeffrey Berman, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=138.02s)]
*  York from 2018 to 2020, when he was forced out by former Attorney General Bill Barr and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=140.3s)]
*  he refused to resign. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=146.06s)]
*  His new book is holding the line inside the nation's preeminent U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=147.62s)]
*  in its battle with the Trump Justice Department. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Berman, the book comes out tomorrow. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=153.78s)]
*  I really appreciate you being here tonight to talk with us about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=156.18s)]
*  This is a lot. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=158.62s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=159.62s)]
*  First, let me just ask you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  I've read the book closely, backwards and forwards, as have members of my staff, and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=163.18s)]
*  helping me prepare to talk with you tonight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=168.18s)]
*  But I readily admit that I may have gotten some of these things wrong as I tried to sum [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  them up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=173.5s)]
*  Is there anything that I said that struck you as wrong or misguided? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=174.5s)]
*  No, no, it was great. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=176.94s)]
*  You know, all of it very accurate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=178.86s)]
*  I have to ask you about this breaking news first. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=183.06s)]
*  Senator Dick Durbin, he chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, is the number two senator. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  He's written to the Justice Department tonight and announced that the Judiciary Committee [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=190.9s)]
*  is launching a formal investigation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=195.02s)]
*  He's asked the department to hand over its documents and communications around these [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=197.02s)]
*  episodes that you described. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you believe that there will be documentation that these communications will be noted in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=205.0s)]
*  some way that the department can provide to the Judiciary Committee so they can investigate [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=212.82s)]
*  these allegations? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=217.82s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure there are documents that are going to be available. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=218.82s)]
*  You know, Rachel, my book, as you know, is all about transparency. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=222.98s)]
*  You know, I wanted people to understand the full scope of the outrageous and improper [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=228.22s)]
*  political interference by Trump's Justice Department in the cases of the Southern District [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=235.18s)]
*  of New York. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=240.14s)]
*  It demonstrates what Trump is capable of and what he's likely to do, and it also provides [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=241.14s)]
*  a front-line view of just how vulnerable our justice system is. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=247.17999999999998s)]
*  And so the book is about transparency, and I welcome this investigation, this congressional [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  investigation, because I think a light has to be thrown on this kind of outrageous conduct [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=259.06s)]
*  that really corrupted the Department of Justice and turned it into a political instrument [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=265.9s)]
*  for the president. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=271.38s)]
*  Some of this conduct you are describing for the first time in this book, but some of this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=274.26s)]
*  use, for lack of a better phrase, squawked about at the time that they forced you out [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=279.3s)]
*  as U.S. attorney. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=285.74s)]
*  You put out this remarkable press release at the time. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=287.02s)]
*  You insisted that you would not resign, that when Bill Barr said you had resigned, that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  he was lying about that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=294.26s)]
*  It was a remarkable confrontation and sort of a stand-up moment on your part. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=296.28s)]
*  I remember it unfolding late at night one Friday night, the summer of 2020, and I was [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=300.94s)]
*  just agog watching it happen in real time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=304.82s)]
*  But you said— [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=307.34s)]
*  Well, I knew— [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=308.34s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=309.34s)]
*  I knew at the time that if Barr got me out the way he wanted to, he would put an outsider [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=310.34s)]
*  in that office who he trusted, and our sensitive investigations that were going on would have [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=317.5s)]
*  been jeopardized. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=323.94s)]
*  And so, you know, I was very noisy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=325.5s)]
*  I told the entire country what I thought Barr was doing and how he crossed the line. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  And I think because of that very noisy exit, as you said, Audrey Strauss took over as an [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=333.5s)]
*  acting U.S. attorney, and she's a person of the highest integrity and an icon of the New [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=339.82000000000005s)]
*  York bar. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=344.56s)]
*  When you put out that press release, when you pushed back in that noisy way, you said—I'm [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=347.06s)]
*  quoting from it here— [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=351.62s)]
*  "...our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=352.62s)]
*  I intend to ensure that this office's important cases continue unimpeded." [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=356.02s)]
*  And you explain in the book that you chose those words carefully because they reference [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=361.58s)]
*  the actual language of the criminal statute on obstruction of justice. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=366.09999999999997s)]
*  I have to ask, the implication of that explanation in your book is that it's possible that you [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=371.14s)]
*  believed it was sort of a crime what happened to your office, that what Trump appointees [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=377.5s)]
*  were trying to do to SDNY was criminal obstruction of justice. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=381.38s)]
*  Is that the implication that you are raising here? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=385.36s)]
*  Well, I haven't focused on whether it's a crime or not, but I can tell you it violated [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=387.2s)]
*  all the norms and traditions of the Department of Justice, which is supposed to be independent [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=392.76s)]
*  from politics. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=399.04s)]
*  And Trump turned the department into his own personal law firm. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=401.04s)]
*  He put in people who would do his bidding, and they would target Trump's political enemies [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=405.48s)]
*  and assist Trump's friends. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=414.88000000000005s)]
*  And it was a disgrace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=416.94000000000005s)]
*  And that's what I kind of detail in the book, several instances of that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  You say throughout the book how you tried to stay and fight to keep SDNY from being [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  corrupted, from the kind of hostile takeover that you describe having taken place in another [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=431.68s)]
*  very prominent, very eminent U.S. attorney's office. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=435.92s)]
*  You have a few different times you say variations of, I didn't want to get fired and replaced [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  by somebody who would be completely compliant, as you just mentioned. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=444.46s)]
*  But I do have to ask you why, when they made you take the individual one language out of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=448.38s)]
*  the Cohen information, when they told you to prosecute John Kerry or they told you to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=455.38s)]
*  prosecute Greg Craig and do it before the election, why didn't we hear this from you [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=459.82s)]
*  then or if you couldn't do it then while you were still holding the job, why didn't [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=464.34s)]
*  we hear it from you when you were fired? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=468.14s)]
*  There are rules, laws and statutes and regulations that prohibit DOJ employees and former employees [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=470.5s)]
*  from talking about ongoing cases and investigations as well as conversations, internal conversations [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=479.74s)]
*  relating to those cases. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=487.82s)]
*  And we are bound by that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=489.58s)]
*  And so for example, when I gave congressional testimony after I got fired and I went to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=492.52s)]
*  the ethics office of the Southern District of New York and the ethics office at Maine [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=499.46s)]
*  Justice and I said, what can I talk about? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=503.62s)]
*  Because there were ongoing investigations that were politically sensitive at the time [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  I got fired and Barr knew about them. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=512.78s)]
*  And can I talk about it? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=516.42s)]
*  And the ruling that came down, and I respected it, is that you can't talk about any ongoing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  investigations because they might be jeopardized. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  You can't talk about any other cases that went on. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=527.18s)]
*  You can't even talk about the conversations that you had with other Department of Justice [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  employees except for the two days before you got fired, you can talk about Bill Barr. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  That's the authority I had when I went into my congressional testimony. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=543.38s)]
*  And quite frankly, it was frustrating because I couldn't tell the whole story and the whole [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=547.28s)]
*  story needed to be told. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=552.3s)]
*  And that's the reason I wrote the book. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=554.62s)]
*  And the book was put through pre-publication review by the Department of Justice. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=557.42s)]
*  I followed all the rules still. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=562.22s)]
*  I've never violated an internal DOJ rule or statute. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=564.42s)]
*  To this day, I'm in compliance with every rule and statute. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=569.1s)]
*  The book has been entirely vetted by the Department of Justice and I've gotten permission to publish [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=572.62s)]
*  it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=577.5s)]
*  And that's, I think, why you don't hear more Department of Justice people talking about [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=578.5s)]
*  the cases they're working on, the investigations, conversations with other people, because they're [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=582.6999999999999s)]
*  restricted from doing so and if they're to behave in an ethical manner, they can't do [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=587.5s)]
*  so. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=594.86s)]
*  You do say, towards the very end of the book, something that resonates very loudly. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=598.62s)]
*  You say that you believe the reason you were forced out was based in politics. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=605.9599999999999s)]
*  The timing five months before the election was not an accident. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=610.06s)]
*  And you say that you believe Barr forced you out of that job at SDNY because he no doubt [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=613.54s)]
*  believed that by removing me, he could eliminate a threat to Trump's reelection. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  How was your work as U.S. Attorney a threat to Trump's reelection? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=622.54s)]
*  Well, at the time I was fired, the Southern District of New York was working on a couple [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=625.5s)]
*  politically sensitive cases. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=632.26s)]
*  One of those cases is the Steve Bannon, We Build the Wall case. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=635.42s)]
*  And we were very close to indicting that case around the time I got fired and Barr knew [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=640.16s)]
*  about the case. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=645.62s)]
*  And as you know, that case was indicted by the Southern District of New York by Audrey [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=647.3s)]
*  Strauss who took over as acting U.S. Attorney after I was fired. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=653.3s)]
*  And then, you know, President Trump pardoned Steve Bannon, which was an outrageous pardon. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=659.82s)]
*  But that's one of the cases that we were investigating and we were very close to indicting. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=668.5s)]
*  And the other case was the Ukraine investigations arising out of the Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=674.7800000000001s)]
*  indictments. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=680.2600000000001s)]
*  And that was something that we had been investigating for quite a while and we continued to investigate [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=682.2600000000001s)]
*  for quite a while. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=687.22s)]
*  Both of them were very sensitive. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=688.22s)]
*  Jeffrey Berman, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, author of the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=692.02s)]
*  very, very newsy new book, Holding the Line Inside the Nation's Preeminent U.S. Attorney's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=695.9s)]
*  Office and its Battle with the Trump Justice Department. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=701.74s)]
*  Sir, thank you for being noisy when it counted. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for relaying what you've done now. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=708.94s)]
*  I imagine we're about to start a whole new chapter in terms of accountability here at [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=710.62s)]
*  the Justice Department, which you served. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=713.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=716.1s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=717.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1Oh8cKCiE&t=718.1s)]
