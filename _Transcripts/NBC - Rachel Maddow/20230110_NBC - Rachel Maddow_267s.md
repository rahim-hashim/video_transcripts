Video Description: Rachel Maddow points out that a significant difference between the story of classified documents found at Joe Biden's think tank and the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago is that Biden returned them as soon as they were discovered, a detail that undermines any further comparisons the right might hope to make in obfuscating Donald Trump's wrongdoing.

# Details of Biden classified documents story deflate right-wing 'whataboutism'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik)
*  There was a brief flurry of excitement on the right this afternoon when CBS News was first to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=0.0s)]
*  report that the U.S. Justice Department had started investigating the discovery of classified [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=6.4s)]
*  documents found at a think tank called the Penn-Biden Center. This is effectively where [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=11.44s)]
*  President Biden had his office in Washington after serving as vice president in the Obama [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=17.68s)]
*  administration. He vacated offices there effectively when he declared his run for president [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=23.76s)]
*  in 2020, but the Penn-Biden Center is sort of the Biden home in D.C. in terms of his work life out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=29.04s)]
*  of office. Well, on November 2nd, lawyers for President Biden, lawyers who work for him in his [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=36.24s)]
*  personal capacity, were reportedly packing up some of the office space that the vice president used [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=42.16s)]
*  at the Penn-Biden Center. In so doing, they found classified documents there, classified documents [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=47.2s)]
*  that they say were in a locked closet inside those offices mixed in with some non-classified [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=53.44s)]
*  documents. This is of course a weird set of circumstances, but that's what they say happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  The White House has since confirmed the basics of this account, as have other news organizations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=65.6s)]
*  after CBS News was first to break the story. The reason this created a lot of excitement on the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=70.08s)]
*  right briefly tonight is that it immediately created a perceived whataboutism defense for [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=75.84s)]
*  President Trump. President Trump is under federal criminal investigation for apparently deliberately [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=82.48s)]
*  hoarding hundreds of classified documents at his home in Florida, including refusing to hand them [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  over after National Archives told them he had to, even after they subpoenaed him to get those [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=94.72s)]
*  documents. So there was this sort of brief excitement on the right tonight that they thought they had a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=99.68s)]
*  new defense, right? Oh, it's supposedly so bad what Trump did at Mar-a-Lago with all the nuclear [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  documents and stuff, but look, Joe Biden's just as bad. Why aren't they serving search warrants on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=109.12s)]
*  President Biden the way they did on former President Trump? As I said tonight, a brief flurry of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  excitement on the right about this prospect when this news broke about the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  The reason it was only a brief flurry of excitement is because in President Biden's case, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  he and his lawyers appear to have actually done the right thing when it comes to these classified [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=132.0s)]
*  documents. Biden's lawyers say they discovered these documents among his vice presidential papers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=136.8s)]
*  at his office at the Penn-Biden Center on November 2nd. The White House Counsel's office then notified [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=142.0s)]
*  the National Archives that same day about what had been found. The National Archives apparently [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  did not even know these documents were missing and had not been seeking their return. The [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=154.0s)]
*  Archives took custody of that material the following morning, and that appears to be it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=160.08s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland has asked one of the last remaining Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=167.12s)]
*  to review the discovery of these documents at the Penn-Biden Center, but it does not sound like it's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=172.64s)]
*  an adversarial process at all. The White House says it is cooperating fully with the National [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=178.32s)]
*  Archives and with the Department of Justice on the review. And again, this was not, as it was in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=183.44s)]
*  Trump's case, the Archives desperately seeking the return of materials that Trump was blowing off, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=189.44s)]
*  and Trump was blowing off those requests and then ultimately blowing off the subpoena to return all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=195.76s)]
*  those documents. These appear to have been documents that were inadvertently held at the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=200.24s)]
*  Penn-Biden Center discovered by Biden's attorneys. They notified, the White House, which notified [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=204.72s)]
*  immediately the National Archives that these documents were in the wrong place. The Archives [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=210.48s)]
*  moved immediately to retrieve them. That appears to be the sum total of it, at least as far as we [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=214.16s)]
*  know. But again, the White House says they are cooperating fully with the Archives and with the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Justice Department on reviewing the situation. Again, we will bring you more on this if we learn [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  more about it tonight, but the brief euphoria on the right that this would somehow, you know, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=230.0s)]
*  exonerate Trump by whataboutism. It's already turning into a bit of a hangover because of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=235.6s)]
*  stark contrast between the actions of the current president and the former guy when it comes to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=241.2s)]
*  classified material. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=245.76s)]
*  you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4Bsrpg3ik&t=265.6s)]
