# Trump fires 1,300 at Department of Education; programs expected to suffer with staff gutted
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0)
*  It started with a sort of mysterious notice this afternoon, a reference to security concerns [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=0.0s)]
*  that went out to all employees at the U.S. Department of Education. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=6.72s)]
*  Quote, beginning today at 6 p.m., all Education Department offices will be closed for security [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=10.32s)]
*  reasons. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=14.88s)]
*  Employees must vacate the building by that time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=16.52s)]
*  This notice also said all Education Department offices would be closed tomorrow and no employees [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  would be allowed in. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=25.0s)]
*  This notice had no details about what these security reasons were, but it was pretty clear [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=26.0s)]
*  what was coming. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=31.92s)]
*  After all, we've been through this a couple of times already now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=32.92s)]
*  It was just over a month ago when people who work at USAID got an email saying their office [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=34.72s)]
*  would be closed the next day and they shouldn't come to work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=38.96s)]
*  That was right before Trump set about completely dismantling that whole agency. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=41.64s)]
*  Employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, same thing, sent a very similar note [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=47.84s)]
*  saying their office would be shut for the following week, just as the White House ordered [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=51.36s)]
*  the entire agency to stop all of its work. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=55.72s)]
*  And sure enough, tonight, just after the 6 p.m. deadline for Education Department workers [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=59.56s)]
*  to vacate their offices because of some security concern, Trump Education Secretary, the billionaire [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=63.76s)]
*  pro-wrestling executive Linda McMahon, announced that her department is cutting its workforce [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=71.2s)]
*  in half. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=76.8s)]
*  They will begin firing more than 1,300 people from the Education Department tonight. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=77.8s)]
*  And then, of course, she went straight to Fox News. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=83.56s)]
*  That was the president's mandate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=88.8s)]
*  This directive to me clearly is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=90.56s)]
*  we'll have to work with Congress to get that accomplished. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=95.64s)]
*  But what we did today was to take the first step of eliminating what I think is bureaucratic [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  bloat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=105.28s)]
*  And that's not to say that a lot of the folks, you know, it's a humanitarian thing to a lot [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=106.28s)]
*  of the folks that are there. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=109.88s)]
*  You know, they're out of a job. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=110.88s)]
*  But we wanted to make sure that we kept all of the right people, the good people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=114.04s)]
*  You know, if you find yourself starting to feel a little tug on your heartstrings for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=118.36s)]
*  those 1,300 people who are out of a job tonight at the Education Department, don't worry. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=124.28s)]
*  We kept all the good people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=129.32s)]
*  We kept all the good people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=132.44s)]
*  The 1,300 people who are getting fired tonight, they just aren't—they're not good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  They're not good. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=138.48s)]
*  Who is this for? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=140.28s)]
*  The vast majority of the American people do not want this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=143.44s)]
*  A poll earlier this month, Reuters-Ipsos, earlier this month found that fully 66 percent [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=146.88s)]
*  of Americans oppose abolishing the Education Department. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=152.12s)]
*  Nearly half of Americans strongly oppose it, while only 16 percent are strongly in favor [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=154.84s)]
*  of it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=161.6s)]
*  This is not something Americans want, but Donald Trump is trying to do it anyway, apparently [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=162.72s)]
*  starting with firing fully half the people who work at that agency tonight. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=167.72s)]
*  This is from NPR on the Trump administration's announcement tonight that they're firing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=172.84s)]
*  1,300 people from the U.S. Department of Education. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Quote, AFGE, American Federation of Government Employees, Local 252, a union that represents [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=180.68s)]
*  Education Department employees, released a statement in which its president, Sharia Smith, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  said, we will fight these draconian cuts. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=191.4s)]
*  Minutes later, AFGE, Local 252, told NPR that Sharia Smith was laid off, along with all five [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=194.52s)]
*  of the chapter's other union officers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=200.76s)]
*  Joining us now is Sharia Smith. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=203.56s)]
*  She's president of the union, representing 2,800 employees at the Education Department. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=204.96s)]
*  She served our country as an attorney for the Education Department's Office for Civil [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=209.68s)]
*  Rights until this evening. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Ms. Smith, thank you so much for being here on tonight of all nights. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=216.76s)]
*  I am sorry for what you're going through. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=219.4s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=221.52s)]
*  My coworkers and I from all over the country really appreciate the platform you're giving [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=222.96s)]
*  us to talk about this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=227.4s)]
*  Is it the case that your whole office is being closed and your colleagues, all of your colleagues [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=229.92s)]
*  at your office, are being fired as well, the whole thing? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=234.76s)]
*  You know, that's so interesting that you asked the question about our whole office. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=237.12s)]
*  So we've reviewed the list of people who are set to be laid off. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=241.16s)]
*  And I also listened to Secretary McMahon's statement about how they're keeping the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=245.8s)]
*  good people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=250.28s)]
*  The people that they seem to be keeping are white men who happen to have graduated from [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=251.52s)]
*  very conservative schools. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=258.38s)]
*  Not to say that they're not good. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=261.82s)]
*  I think all of my coworkers are excellent. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=262.94s)]
*  Many of them are members. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=265.46s)]
*  But the coworkers that are being laid off as well are also good. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=267.5s)]
*  What is curious in the U.S. Department of Education is that the layoffs, the mass terminations, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=271.58s)]
*  the administrative leaves are seeming to affect and impact disproportionately women and people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=278.46s)]
*  of color. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=286.92s)]
*  And the Department of Education should be a model employer. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=287.92s)]
*  And I want American people to think about, do they want their employer to follow this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=292.24s)]
*  model where the only people that are deemed good enough to keep their jobs and their ability [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  to support their families are people who are from a certain race and are of a certain gender? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=303.66s)]
*  I know that this has all just happened in the last few hours, but with what they've [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  been telegraphing about their plans for the education department, I know that you and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=317.0s)]
*  your union colleagues and your colleagues at work more broadly have to have been expecting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=321.16s)]
*  the worst. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=325.42s)]
*  Do you believe that your union or that the employees more broadly have recourse to fight [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  these firings and have recourse to fight their efforts to abolish the department? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=332.26s)]
*  Well, absolutely, because their efforts are illegal. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=337.48s)]
*  But again, since the new administration came into office, we have experienced mass terminations [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  and unchecked unprofessionalism. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=349.76s)]
*  And people just not going by the rules, even this layoff, is not something that should [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  have occurred. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=360.0s)]
*  The layoff was not because of a budget shortfall. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=361.0s)]
*  The president can't just lay people off because he does not agree with them or he [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=364.24s)]
*  does not like the color of their skin or their gender. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=368.76s)]
*  So certainly we are availing ourselves of all recourse to challenge this and talking [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=372.24s)]
*  with attorneys, and we have been since the first round of layoffs on January 21st. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=379.52s)]
*  And so we'll be fighting, and we hope the American people will fight with us. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=387.76s)]
*  You know, Linda McMahon, in explaining what she's doing here, has also said that the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=393.36s)]
*  American people should expect that there will be no interruption to any of the programs [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=397.68s)]
*  that the Education Department administers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  I have to ask you if that is possible with what they're—even just what they're [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=404.08s)]
*  planning tonight, with half the workforce gone overnight. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=408.96s)]
*  Absolutely not possible. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  Since January 21st, our entire agency has been interrupted. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=414.14s)]
*  We've been told not to work. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=417.2s)]
*  We've had people who have been forced from working, even though they have been high performers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=419.08s)]
*  There's no way—we were already understaffed. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=424.4s)]
*  There is no way we can continue operations at the levels that we had been when you have [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=427.76s)]
*  half the workforce and you have fired great people. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=433.36s)]
*  You have fired high performers. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=437.52s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=440.76s)]
*  Sharia Smith is the president of the AFGE union that represents Education Department [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=443.56s)]
*  employees. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=449.2s)]
*  She's an attorney for the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=450.2s)]
*  She was fired this evening, but as she says, she believes that she and her colleagues have [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=453.12s)]
*  absolute recourse to fight back against these firings as illegal. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  Ms. Smith, again, I am sorry for what you and your colleagues are going through tonight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=462.24s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time to talk us through it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=465.92s)]
*  And please stay in touch with us as this proceeds. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  I know this won't be the last we'll be hearing from you. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=470.24s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=473.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=474.24s)]
*  Good luck to you. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=475.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t24ulxQgaN0&t=486.92s)]
