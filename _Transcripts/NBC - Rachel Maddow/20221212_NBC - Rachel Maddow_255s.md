# Report Shows GOP Members Of Congress advocating Sedition In Texts To Mark Meadows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8)
*  In addition to Congressman Ralph Norman of South Carolina calling for martial law, calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=0.0s)]
*  for the U.S. military to install Trump in power, even after January 6 happened, there's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=6.2s)]
*  also a Republican congressman from Tennessee telling White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=12.26s)]
*  that Republican legislatures should just overrule the vote in their states and proclaim Trump [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=17.64s)]
*  the winner. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=23.04s)]
*  Congressman Mark Green of Tennessee told the White House chief of staff that should happen [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=24.32s)]
*  in various Republican controlled states because he described a guest on Newsmax as saying [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=28.26s)]
*  that was a legal possibility. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=34.18s)]
*  Also a North Carolina congressman pushing the same strategy, Congressman Greg Murphy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=37.14s)]
*  of North Carolina pushing the same strategy as Green, cut and pasted from a right-wing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=42.260000000000005s)]
*  website in his case. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Also another North Carolina congressman suggesting to Mark Meadows, in this case it was Ted Budd [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=48.7s)]
*  of North Carolina, he suggested to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that the voting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  machines had all been rigged by George Soros. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=58.62s)]
*  That congressman actually not only is going back to Congress, he's going back to Congress [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=62.58s)]
*  as a senator because he just got promoted to U.S. Senator in last month's election [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=66.46s)]
*  in North Carolina, Ted Budd. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=71.38s)]
*  Also right-wing favorite congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, he sent the White House [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=74.5s)]
*  chief of staff a link to supposed evidence of election rigging. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=78.78s)]
*  He got this supposed evidence and he forwarded the citation to Mark Meadows in the White [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=83.42s)]
*  House. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=88.26s)]
*  The blog that he got the information was called Some Swear Word Told Me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=89.26s)]
*  Word that starts with B and rhymes with Mitch. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=95.54s)]
*  Some Blank Told Me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=98.02s)]
*  That's the name of the blog that he cited to the White House chief of staff to justify [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=99.86s)]
*  whatever means were necessary to keep Trump in power. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=106.06s)]
*  Some B Told Me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Jim Jordan of Ohio texting a detailed plan for how Vice President Mike Pence could overturn [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=112.74s)]
*  the election and proclaim Trump to have been re-elected when he wasn't. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=118.02s)]
*  Jim Jordan is expected to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee next year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=122.02s)]
*  And in lots of cases there's no record of Mark Meadows ever replying to these messages, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=128.78s)]
*  but in some cases he does. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=134.62s)]
*  And there are also references that suggest he was communicating with many of these members [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=136.5s)]
*  of Congress separately on encrypted messaging apps. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=139.86s)]
*  And those would be messages that as far as we know the January 6 investigation has not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=143.38000000000002s)]
*  yet obtained. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, he exchanged so many texts with Mark Meadows [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  full of baroque conspiracy theories about Italian satellites rigging voting machines [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  and the CIA director being in cahoots with the British government. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  The British government? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=163.62s)]
*  To steal the election for Biden? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  Why would the CIA work with the Brits to steal? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=167.1s)]
*  There was so much of that from Republican Congressman Scott Perry. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=170.26s)]
*  The Talking Points Memo has a whole separate article tonight dedicated just to Scott Perry's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=173.9s)]
*  texts to and from the White House chief of staff. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=179.06s)]
*  Congressman Scott Perry chairs something called the House Freedom Caucus, which is a powerful [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=182.34s)]
*  group of far-right Republicans whose power is set to grow next year under the Republicans' [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=186.38s)]
*  razor-thin House majority. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=191.18s)]
*  It may also be the entity that determines who gets to be the next Republican speaker [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=193.32s)]
*  of the House. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=197.0s)]
*  We also reached out to Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania for comment tonight, but we [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=198.92s)]
*  have not yet heard back. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  Again, many of these text messages have been reported before, some of them in drips and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=204.68s)]
*  drops. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=208.56s)]
*  But the difference tonight is that we now know, A, we can see all these text messages [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=209.56s)]
*  together, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=213.0s)]
*  But also these guys are going to be in charge of the U.S. Congress, in charge of the U.S. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=214.44s)]
*  House in just a few weeks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=217.84s)]
*  Which means, among other things, as I said, that the January 6th investigation, which [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=219.66s)]
*  first unearthed these text messages, that's going to be shut down. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=223.54s)]
*  Because of course, if you were a Republican who had been involved in this stuff during [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=227.98s)]
*  the January 6th era, of course you would like to shut down that investigation. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcorlE-h0s8&t=231.01999999999998s)]
