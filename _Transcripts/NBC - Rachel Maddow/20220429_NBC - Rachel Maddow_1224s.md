# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 28
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4)
*  This thing that we covered last night with this ridiculous Trump deposition that gave [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=0.0s)]
*  rise to 100 million hilarious fruit-related headlines today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  This deposition he gave where he said that you could be killed if somebody threw a tomato [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=10.44s)]
*  at you, that that's a lethal threat that must be met with maximum force. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that undoubtedly was hilarious. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=18.72s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=21.88s)]
*  But that came in a deposition in a case where Trump is trying not to be held accountable [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=23.44s)]
*  for his security guards beating up protesters. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=27.72s)]
*  Now, the clear impression from the way he talks about protesters is that he would like [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  for people protesting against him to be beat up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  That would give him pleasure. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=37.84s)]
*  He has talked about how that makes the threat of beating up anti-Trump protesters makes [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=38.84s)]
*  Trump rallies, in his words, more fun. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=43.48s)]
*  He would like to be able to do that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=47.4s)]
*  Well, how do you get to do that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=48.92s)]
*  How do you get away with something like that? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Hype some non-existent threat beyond all recognition to justify and provide a pretext for it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  For whatever extreme thing you want to do and get away with. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=57.7s)]
*  If you want to beat up protesters against you because you enjoy that, you find it fun. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  But the worst thing anybody can say about the threat posed by that process, those processes [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=65.06s)]
*  that one of them once was rumored to have a tomato. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=68.7s)]
*  Well, describe a tomato was a lethal threat then. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=71.34s)]
*  Anybody protesting against you is a lethal threat and therefore deserves maximum force. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=75.58s)]
*  It's the same tactical pattern over and over again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=82.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  Lock her up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=86.78s)]
*  Lock her up about Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=87.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=89.5s)]
*  What was the ostensible reason they were going to lock her up? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=90.5s)]
*  Because she used her personal email account when she was working at the State Department. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=93.66s)]
*  Yes, that's it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=98.5s)]
*  And that is such a threat to the very foundations of America that she must be locked up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=100.3s)]
*  She must be jailed for that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=107.22s)]
*  She should be executed for treason for that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=108.22s)]
*  I mean, never mind that it's impossible to find anybody in the Trump administration who [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=110.38s)]
*  didn't use their personal email while they worked in government. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=114.5s)]
*  Never mind that Trump literally trucked boxes of highly classified material to Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=117.5s)]
*  and left it laying around at his golf club. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=121.82s)]
*  There isn't actually a real concern about the handling of classified information or [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=124.38s)]
*  government material being stored or handled improperly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=128.98s)]
*  There isn't a real perceived threat here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=134.04s)]
*  But if you can talk about that threat as if it's the worst thing in the world, well, then [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=137.66s)]
*  you can use it as a pretext for what you want to do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=141.96s)]
*  And so if what you want to do is jail your political opposition or maybe have them killed, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  well, hype some non-existent threat that you attach to them beyond all recognition to justify [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=155.96s)]
*  That's how you build yourself the pretext you need. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=157.78s)]
*  Voting fraud. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  Actual voting fraud is like a handful of old Trump-supporting white men in the villages [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  in Florida and in New Hampshire and Ohio all voting twice for Trump because they thought [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  no one would notice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm just picking those cases out of a hat because those happen to be the ones top of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=170.94s)]
*  mine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=173.94s)]
*  But those are also all the voting fraud cases that have broken in the last few months. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=174.94s)]
*  You take that invisible, infinitesimal, totally non-consequential threat and turn it into [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  a mechanized million-strong cabal using like South Korean planes and Venezuela and Italian [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  satellites and Jewish space lasers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  And pretty soon, you know, voting fraud is the end of America. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  Which surely is enough to justify what it is you want to do in the first place, which [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=200.7s)]
*  is stop abiding by actual election results, take and hold power by force and insistence. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=206.06s)]
*  Voting fraud is so extreme, we definitely need martial law. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=211.98s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=215.54s)]
*  Well, if you make voting fraud into an existential threat, then you can justify anything in response [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=216.54s)]
*  to that threat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=222.78s)]
*  This is not something we invented. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=226.5s)]
*  This is not something the Trump era invented. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=228.62s)]
*  I mean, Russia invaded Ukraine in February telling the Russian people it was because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=230.34s)]
*  Ukraine was a military threat gearing up to attack Russia. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=234.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  Russia is 3000% larger than Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=238.7s)]
*  That's like saying the town of Putney, Vermont was going to invade Mexico or that Aruba [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=241.62s)]
*  was going to invade China. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=245.5s)]
*  But still, make the claim. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  Find a threat, invent a threat or find one somewhere and hype it beyond comprehension. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=251.3s)]
*  Neutralize the bizarreness of that supposed overhyped, supposed an overhyped threat. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=258.82s)]
*  Neutralize the bizarreness of it through propagandistic mass repetition and bingo. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=266.3s)]
*  Lock her up, presses the enemy of the people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=275.1s)]
*  Ukraine needs to be demilitarized and denazified. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=278.86s)]
*  Take invent a threat out of whole cloth or take the smallest thing in the world and blow [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=283.34s)]
*  it up into something incomprehensibly massive and bingo, you have the pretext for anything [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=287.14s)]
*  that you want to do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=292.74s)]
*  The time that we are in is the overlap in the Venn diagram between stupid and scary. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  You are here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=303.82s)]
*  This kind of tactic that we are seeing against the press, against voting, against political [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=306.58s)]
*  opponents, it is a tactic that is not new. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=312.26s)]
*  It is a tactic that we did not invent in this country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=315.3s)]
*  But if we can see it more clearly, if we can get more fluent about it in talking about [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=318.58s)]
*  it amongst ourselves, one of the things we will quickly learn is that we can turn to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=323.82s)]
*  our advantage the learned experience of the people who have gone before us and faced it [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=329.54s)]
*  and fought it before we have had to. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=334.7s)]
*  Our own political right is quite deep into its, you know, the press is the enemy of the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=337.6s)]
*  people phase. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=344.44s)]
*  This weekend is the White House Correspondence Association dinner, which the last president [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=346.36s)]
*  didn't go to his whole time in office and not just because of COVID. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=350.0s)]
*  It's because the last president literally campaigned against there being a free press. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  He literally campaigned on that enemy of the people phrase, which he borrowed from Stalin. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=358.04s)]
*  This weekend for the first time in three years, the correspondence dinner is back on [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=363.84s)]
*  after being shut for COVID. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=367.96s)]
*  The Biden White House is getting a little bit of a hard time, understandably, about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=369.79999999999995s)]
*  the fact that President Biden is planning to go to the dinner in person. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=374.35999999999996s)]
*  It's understandable that they're getting a hard time for that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a controversial decision. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=380.4s)]
*  It's going to be like 2000 plus people in an indoor ballroom. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  The president is 79. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  The vice president currently right now already has COVID. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=386.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I get it in terms of why COVID concerns are enough to make you maybe not want to see [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=389.84s)]
*  President Biden attend this event in person this weekend. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  On the other hand, I see the other side. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=398.2s)]
*  It does mean something and something important in this moment now, both domestically and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  for our role in the world. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=405.08s)]
*  It means something for a U.S. president to show up, to stand for the press, to stand [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=406.44s)]
*  with the press, even as the press, I'm sure, drives this president just as bananas as we [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=411.0s)]
*  have every other president and politician since the dawn of time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=419.44s)]
*  But right now, it's it's it's particularly important for a U.S. president to stand with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=421.79999999999995s)]
*  the press. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  Because there really is an opposing side here, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  From the other side of American politics. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, you know, we have a lot of fake news back there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=437.2s)]
*  These fake news. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm talking about the fake news media. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=441.79999999999995s)]
*  They are truly an enemy of the people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=444.56s)]
*  The fake news media right back there. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=447.0s)]
*  It's the enemy of the people. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=452.48s)]
*  Our media is the enemy of the people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=453.92s)]
*  It's very, very dangerous what they do. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=457.48s)]
*  The repetition is part of the point here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=461.0s)]
*  The repetition is part of how that works. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=462.52s)]
*  The repetition is how it stops seeming shocking and starts seeming like something you've heard [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=464.6s)]
*  before, something that resonates. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=468.08s)]
*  And that has sunk in. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=469.8s)]
*  And doing that for that long, right, doing that for the last seven years, that has sunk [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=471.8s)]
*  in. That has changed things. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=476.12s)]
*  I mean, you know, at this point, there are not going to be any debates between the next [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=478.88s)]
*  two candidates in the next presidential election. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=483.16s)]
*  The Republican Party says they're done. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=487.12s)]
*  They're not doing that anymore because, you know, whether or not the Republican Party's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=488.8s)]
*  presidential candidate next time around is going to be Donald Trump, the party itself [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  has decided this year that they can no longer abide the fact that it is reporters who ask [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=496.16s)]
*  questions at presidential debates. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=500.92s)]
*  And so, therefore, there will be no presidential debates in 2024. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=503.12s)]
*  It's a remarkable decision. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=508.16s)]
*  And it's on the basis of the fact that the press is involved in asking the questions. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=510.2s)]
*  The Republican Party can no longer abide that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=514.04s)]
*  It's less controversial. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=517.84s)]
*  It's received way less attention than that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=518.84s)]
*  But in Republican controlled states this year, we've seen a whole rash of new rules and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=521.88s)]
*  new restrictions put in place that ban reporters from covering state governments, from [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=526.28s)]
*  covering state legislatures in Utah, in Kansas, in Iowa. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=531.44s)]
*  When they decided to ban reporters from the Iowa legislature this year, it broke what [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  was otherwise a 140 year unbroken tradition. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=540.36s)]
*  For 140 years, it worked to have reporters in there asking legislators questions. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=544.08s)]
*  This year, with this Republican Party, that no longer works. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=547.96s)]
*  Reporters are banned. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=551.84s)]
*  Last fall, the Republican governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, asked state law enforcement [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=554.8000000000001s)]
*  to pursue criminal charges against a local reporter in Missouri because that reporter [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=559.0s)]
*  reported accurately on a security flaw in the state's computer systems. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=564.76s)]
*  The governor actually got state law enforcement to investigate that reporter for months [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=570.6s)]
*  as if there was some crime in that reporting. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=576.56s)]
*  They actually tried to bring charges against the reporter, but no prosecutor would do it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=578.8s)]
*  I didn't actually think it would get much worse than what we saw from Governor Mike [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=585.2s)]
*  Parson in Missouri. But then this week, hello, California, the Fox News darling [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=587.68s)]
*  conservative sheriff of Los Angeles County convened a press conference in which he put [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=591.68s)]
*  a reporter's photo up on a big poster, he's pointing to it there with a pointy stick. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  Sign says, when did she what did she know and when did she know it? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=602.7199999999999s)]
*  And he pointed out that reporter who was, in fact, covering that press conference from [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=607.0s)]
*  the first row at that moment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=610.04s)]
*  He said she was going to be the subject of a criminal investigation for this dastardly [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=611.68s)]
*  reporting she was doing on scandals in the sheriff's office. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=615.4s)]
*  In addition to putting up her photo, he put up a list of alleged crimes. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=619.92s)]
*  He was pretty sure this reporter might have committed by doing this reporting on scandals [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=624.84s)]
*  in his office. Now, we covered that story earlier this week here on this show. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=629.76s)]
*  We can report tonight that after a righteous and furious pushback, that sheriff is now [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=634.2s)]
*  pretending he never did that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=639.32s)]
*  It's one thing to change your mind and say, oh, my bad, I got carried away. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=642.04s)]
*  Another thing to say, no, I didn't do that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=645.6s)]
*  You dastardly people for saying I did. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=647.72s)]
*  Let's all forget that happened. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=650.72s)]
*  How about we don't? But this idea that there's a supposed terrible threat from the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=653.52s)]
*  press that reporters aren't just irritating to people in power, but actually criminal, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  that the free press is a threat that must be destroyed, physically destroyed. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=665.16s)]
*  I mean, this is something that we should get fluent in. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=672.36s)]
*  I mean, this is a this is an issue that is not hiding its light under a bushel. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=676.48s)]
*  All right. This is not something that you really have to go looking too hard for. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=680.6s)]
*  I mean, on January 6th, they really did carve the phrase murder the media into the U.S. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=683.72s)]
*  Capitol. They left that behind. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=689.28s)]
*  Presumably, they meant it. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  This is a thing we should be able to see clearly by now. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=693.12s)]
*  Even when they're doing it in a way that's more stupid than scary, it's the same thing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  It is a tactical pattern that we should see, recognize and be able to discuss and be [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=700.8s)]
*  able to think clearly about. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=705.7199999999999s)]
*  In 2010, Yale historian Tim Snyder published a new history, kind of a shocking new [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=709.0799999999999s)]
*  history of World War Two. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  Professor Snyder specializes in the history of Central and Eastern Europe. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=717.28s)]
*  And the book was called Bloodlands, Europe between Hitler and Stalin. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=720.24s)]
*  That book took on really for the first time what happened in total on the land east of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=724.64s)]
*  Berlin and west of Moscow between 1933 and 1945. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=733.44s)]
*  He he elected to do something that nobody had ever really tried to do about that geography [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=737.68s)]
*  in the world in that time. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=743.2s)]
*  He told a single history, a single story of the 14 million people who were killed in that [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=744.32s)]
*  part of the world while both Hitler and Stalin held power. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=750.88s)]
*  14 million people who were not soldiers, civilian noncombatants, not people who were [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=754.16s)]
*  caught in the crossfire while while countries were trying to kill each other's soldiers. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=760.8s)]
*  These were victims of mass killings sanctioned by policy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=765.32s)]
*  In Western Russia and Belarus and Poland and Ukraine and the Baltic states, all in the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=771.2s)]
*  same place, all from two different dictators over a 12 year time span. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=775.2s)]
*  Again, not war casualties in the sense of combatants, but war casualties in the sense [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=779.32s)]
*  of mass killing being a policy. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=784.24s)]
*  Professor Snyder's book is recognized and was soon recognized as a gigantic achievement [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=787.88s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  It's, of course, all the more relevant because of the war in Ukraine now. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=794.84s)]
*  This week, Professor Snyder published an updated paperback version of Bloodlands. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  This one has a new afterward, which offers a contemporary look at the work in it, among [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=803.5600000000001s)]
*  many other things. Professor Snyder reflects on his contribution to popularizing the use [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=808.52s)]
*  of the term the big lie in reference to former President Trump's effort to basically [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=813.4s)]
*  overthrow the U.S. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=818.12s)]
*  government last year, persuading his followers to believe the big lie that the 2020 election [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=818.92s)]
*  was somehow stolen, even though there was never, ever any evidence to support that. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=824.12s)]
*  Snyder says in his new afterward, quote, The big lie, a term that originates with Hitler, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=829.52s)]
*  became central to American political discourse after I applied it to Trump's claim to have [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=834.36s)]
*  won an election that he had lost. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=838.24s)]
*  The concept of the big lie, which I reintroduced into discussion in 2019 and 2020, helped [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=840.16s)]
*  millions of people see how mendacity of a certain scale affects politics over time, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=845.2s)]
*  making democracy ever more difficult. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=852.88s)]
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=855.32s)]
*  He is professor of history at Yale University. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  He's the author of Bloodlands Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=858.28s)]
*  Again, it is out in a new edition this week. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=861.76s)]
*  Professor Snyder, it's really nice to have you here in person. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=863.4s)]
*  I don't do this anymore. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=865.6s)]
*  It's nice to see you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a thrill to see you. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you about that last quote that I just read. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=869.4s)]
*  Mendacity of a certain scale, how mendacity of a certain scale affects politics over time. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=874.32s)]
*  Can you just tell us what you mean? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=880.64s)]
*  Well, that's the public relations advice is from Hitler. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=882.76s)]
*  Hitler says if you tell a lie that's of a certain scale, that's big enough, people won't [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=885.88s)]
*  believe that you could deceive them on that scale. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=891.44s)]
*  And since they believe it, they take it in at first, they don't want to disbelieve it [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  later on. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=898.4s)]
*  It becomes part of their life. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=898.88s)]
*  It becomes what we now call an alternative reality. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=900.12s)]
*  It begins to shape politics. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=902.48s)]
*  It then begins to instantiate itself not only in memory, but in policy. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=904.16s)]
*  You act as if it's true and then you move on to do things as though it were true. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=908.16s)]
*  So in our example, if we pretend that Trump won the election in 2020, then we have an [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=912.84s)]
*  argument for suppressing votes because we can say, well, there was fraud, therefore [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=918.12s)]
*  we should suppress votes. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=922.88s)]
*  It's because of the sort of commitment part of that, it makes it feel undoable because [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=925.12s)]
*  if an X number of people become invested in it because they have once believed it and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=931.72s)]
*  it would challenge their understanding of who they are and their worth in the world [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=940.2s)]
*  to lose that belief in it, it makes me worry about the ability to sort of unwire people [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=943.88s)]
*  to learn the truth. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=950.84s)]
*  And this is why lying is so dangerous in politics. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=952.24s)]
*  We've gotten very casual about lying. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=954.56s)]
*  We've gotten very casual about the people who bring us the truth, who are the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=956.5999999999999s)]
*  reporters. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=959.3199999999999s)]
*  We've gotten very casual about the historians who are passing memory laws in this [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  country, just as Russia has passed memory laws. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=963.7199999999999s)]
*  Those are laws designed in both cases to allow us to avoid the difficult little [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=966.28s)]
*  truths that might prevent us from investing in the big lies. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=971.16s)]
*  And the problem with the citizens in the big lies, people in general in the big lies, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  is that once you do something, for example, storm a capital, once you do something, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=977.8s)]
*  that makes it more true. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=982.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=984.64s)]
*  So the politicians tell the big lie. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=984.88s)]
*  But once we're brought in, once we do something, or in this book, for example, once [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  you kill on the basis of a big lie, then the big lie really has to be true. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  One of the things that I have sort of taken with me from Bloodlands is the idea that [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=997.16s)]
*  people need to be erased and countries need to be erased and certain identities need to [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1003.5999999999999s)]
*  be erased for the purposes of other countries, other leaders, other imperatives. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1007.4s)]
*  And so, you know, talking, for example, about the mass murder of the Polish elite so [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1011.88s)]
*  that the Polish people would somehow could somehow be erased from history, that the idea [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1016.84s)]
*  of Poland as a place could somehow be subverted into some other thing that was more [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1021.04s)]
*  politically useful for the attackers. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1024.44s)]
*  That kind of eliminationist planning, not just genocidal, but literally to erase the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1027.48s)]
*  idea of a people. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1032.28s)]
*  We are seeing that so overtly in the way that Putin is talking about Ukraine right now. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1033.56s)]
*  I am very worried that we are starting to talk in eliminationist terms about some of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1039.6399999999999s)]
*  our fellow Americans, the way that we're using not just epithets, but also sort of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1044.04s)]
*  classifications of people as not just our political opponents, but as inhuman. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1049.1599999999999s)]
*  The German invasion of Poland in 1939 has really been on my mind, too, because it's not [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  just how Putin is describing Ukrainians. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1058.48s)]
*  As you say, he says, Ukrainians are a nation. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  They're not really a state. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1063.24s)]
*  And that's genocide talk. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1064.48s)]
*  That's that's how you talk before you try to eliminate the nation and the state. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1065.6399999999999s)]
*  But it's not just talk. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1070.12s)]
*  This is this war of aggression is also a war of destruction. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  They've deported about a million Ukrainians. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1074.04s)]
*  That's a considerable share of the population. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1076.28s)]
*  They're shooting the local elites. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1078.28s)]
*  They're killing the men they think are capable of taking part in military activity. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1079.9599999999998s)]
*  They're reeducating the teachers and the children. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1084.1599999999999s)]
*  They're going through with this idea as best they can of trying to eliminate the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1086.8s)]
*  Ukrainian nation. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1090.76s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1091.96s)]
*  It all starts. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  It starts with talk. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1093.6799999999998s)]
*  And that's why we look on these examples of how Russians treat their history, how [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1095.48s)]
*  they treat their reporters, how they treat their language. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1099.44s)]
*  And we have to learn these lessons in time, because as you say, if we talk about our [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1103.12s)]
*  own reporters, our own fellow citizens in the same way, then we're preparing ourselves [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1107.08s)]
*  to do terrible things. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1111.28s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, you know him here on this show as the author of On Tyranny, which we [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1112.36s)]
*  have discussed many times here on this show. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1116.24s)]
*  The book that is seen as his sort of totem in the in the in the world of modern history [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1118.32s)]
*  is called Bloodlands. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1124.12s)]
*  And it's out in a new edition as of this week with a new afterword about the world [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  today. Dr. Snyder, it's an honor to have you here. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1131.3999999999999s)]

*  If you've watched this show, you have seen the work of an artist, a courtroom sketch [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1133.8s)]
*  artist named Art Lean. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1137.32s)]
*  Federal courts don't allow cameras, so we have needed Art Lean to be able to visualize [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1139.2s)]
*  lots of the proceedings we've covered here over the years, including lots of Trump era [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1143.8400000000001s)]
*  favorites like Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, the Supreme Court justices themselves at [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1148.0400000000002s)]
*  work. Arthur Lane started work as a court artist in 1976. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1153.48s)]
*  He's an unparalleled talent in a very niche and very important part of public life. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1158.0s)]
*  He was the only courtroom artist allowed into the first military service in the country. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  He was the only courtroom artist allowed into the first military tribunals at Guantanamo. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1167.12s)]
*  In the early days of the pandemic, he adapted to virtual Supreme Court proceedings by [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1171.76s)]
*  getting lawyers to send him photos of themselves making their oral arguments. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1175.56s)]
*  He then turned those photos into sketches. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  This sketch captures Stephen Breyer's last case as a Supreme Court justice. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1182.52s)]
*  It's also Art Lean's final sketch for the Supreme Court because he is also retiring at [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1187.8s)]
*  the end of the Supreme Court term. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1192.36s)]
*  He is retiring at the height of his powers. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1194.52s)]
*  You have no idea how much we have depended on you all of these years. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1196.36s)]
*  Happy retirement, Mr. Lean. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2fu-cSr7c4&t=1200.9199999999998s)]
