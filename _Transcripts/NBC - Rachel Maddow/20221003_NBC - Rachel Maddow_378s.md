# Supreme Court Case Selection Suggests Aggressive Conservative Agenda In New Term
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U)
*  The New York Times today reporting that if the Republicans do take over the House, at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=0.0s)]
*  least eight congressional committees are due to be chaired by members of Congress who voted [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=4.84s)]
*  to not certify the election results, who voted to overturn the election results and keep [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=9.44s)]
*  Trump in power despite the vote. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=13.96s)]
*  These are all members of Congress who took that vote after the Capitol attack on January [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=17.12s)]
*  6th. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=21.36s)]
*  They'll be running eight of the most important committees in the U.S. Congress. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=22.36s)]
*  And also, this is the Supreme Court term just started today in which the new conservative [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=28.0s)]
*  supermajority on the Supreme Court has gone out of their way to put a case before themselves [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=34.76s)]
*  on something called the Independent State Legislature Doctrine, which is a thing that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=39.4s)]
*  I swear to you is well and truly boring. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=43.96s)]
*  The more you read about it, the more suffer-ific you will feel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=47.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just boring, particularly if you're not a lawyer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=50.68s)]
*  What the Independent State Legislature Doctrine could do, what this case could do now that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=54.44s)]
*  these Supreme Court justices have asked to hear a case about it, is it effectively could [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=59.88s)]
*  give Republicans in state legislatures the power to do what Trump demanded that they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=66.8s)]
*  do in 2020. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=71.68s)]
*  It could give Republican-controlled state legislatures the power to decide what the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=73.16s)]
*  election results will be from that state, regardless of how the people of that state [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=77.28s)]
*  voted, which is what Trump demanded of Republican state legislators after 2020. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=81.6s)]
*  The Supreme Court case that's before the court for this term could potentially legalize [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=88.2s)]
*  the illegal unconstitutional scheme that Trump was demanding of Republicans who supported [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=94.4s)]
*  him to hand him the electors from states that he in fact lost. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=100.24s)]
*  So this is quite a moment, right? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, at a time when we've got the biggest sedition trial in 80 years underway in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  Washington, I'm doing a podcast about the last sedition threat like this from the late [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=115.76s)]
*  30s and the early 40s in order to find the closest precedent to what we're facing today. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=120.28s)]
*  While that is happening in Washington as of today, we're not just closing in on an [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=125.08s)]
*  election where people who deny that we should have real election results anymore are trying [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=129.68s)]
*  to take over. We're also today starting a new Supreme Court session with a court that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  has never had a lower level of respect from the American people in the entire time that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=139.12s)]
*  pollsters have been asking the American people about their level of respect for the court. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=143.56s)]
*  With the new conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, they are reaching way out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=148.88s)]
*  this term, way, way out of their way to take cases that are expected to serve as a vehicle [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=153.88s)]
*  for them to let state legislatures change election results, to get rid of affirmative [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=159.24s)]
*  action programs and education, to get rid of anti-discrimination civil rights laws that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  protect gay people, and to once and for all get rid of the crown jewel achievement of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  the United States Civil Rights Movement, which of course is the Voting Rights Act. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Conservatives on the court already took away the heart of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Now with the case they're going to hear tomorrow, they could pave the way to hollow out all [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=182.44s)]
*  the rest of it, too. That case they're going to hear tomorrow is a case out of Alabama. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=186.88s)]
*  Alabama has a population that's more than a quarter African-American, but the Republicans [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=191.0s)]
*  who control the Alabama state legislature want only one of the state's congressional [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=196.28s)]
*  districts to have a majority black electorate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=200.72s)]
*  Under the Voting Rights Act, even a very conservative court with two Trump-appointed judges told [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=205.2s)]
*  Alabama that they couldn't do that, that that's an illegal infringement on the voting rights [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=211.2s)]
*  of black voters. You can't have more than a quarter of your population be African-American [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=216.24s)]
*  and then have six of your seven congressional seats be in majority white districts. The [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=221.2s)]
*  Voting Rights Act, even hollowed out as it is, prevents them from doing something that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  extreme. That's the court ruling that is controlling in that case right now, but the Supreme Court [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=230.8s)]
*  has nevertheless chosen to wait in, with the expectation being that they're going to tell [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=236.56s)]
*  Alabama and the rest of the country to go ahead, do what you want. There's no need to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  worry about that pesky Voting Rights Act anymore. And if you think that is too radical a thing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=245.84s)]
*  to imagine them doing, I mean this is the court that just overruled Roe v. Wade, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=252.32s)]
*  A recent Gallup poll shows that the American people say their trust in the court has dropped [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=258.72s)]
*  20 points just since 2020, just in the past two years. Another similar poll from Marquette [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=264.08s)]
*  Law School shows it's dropped 26 points in the past two years. If the perception of the court [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=269.92s)]
*  keeps dropping like that, you might think the court would start to get worried that Americans soon [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=277.44s)]
*  just won't respect the court enough to follow its rulings anymore, which of course would be a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=281.76s)]
*  disaster for the country. That would literally be the end of the rule of law in a very fundamental way. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=285.44s)]
*  But if there's one thing we can be sure of, it is that we are playing with the fundamentals [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=293.12s)]
*  in lots of ways these days, pushing ourselves right up to the edge and occasionally over it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=297.2s)]
*  And we all know enough history to know that we have pushed ourselves far, very far, in the past as well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=302.88s)]
*  But these fights to hold on to our constitutional republic, they don't win themselves. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=311.12s)]
*  The constitution isn't a self-healing document. Prosecutions for this kind of stuff, even when [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=316.56s)]
*  they happen, they are hard to win and they are not the end all be all for accountability. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  Whether you are volunteering for a candidate who's running this year, or maybe you're running for [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  office yourself, or you're volunteering as a poll worker, or you're door knocking for the latest [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=331.84s)]
*  good government pro-democracy initiative that's on the ballot where you live, whatever you are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  doing right now, particularly over these next six weeks, you are part of what will decide what [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=341.28s)]
*  happens next in our country. The outcome is not at all certain at this point. We are in the middle [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=346.24s)]
*  of it. And good luck to us all. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAkP-084O3U&t=353.52s)]
