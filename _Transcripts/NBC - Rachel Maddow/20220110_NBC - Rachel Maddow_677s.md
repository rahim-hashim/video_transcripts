# Trump Lawyers Met With Georgia Prosecutors; Days Later, Trump Rants About Law Enforcement
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ)
*  We do actually have some breaking news to start with at this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We can report exclusively tonight that attorneys for former President Donald Trump have now met [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=4.08s)]
*  in person with the Fulton County District Attorney's Office in Georgia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=10.64s)]
*  Now, it was months ago that we first learned that the prosecutor who leads that office, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=15.6s)]
*  a prosecutor named Fannie Willis, had opened a criminal investigation into alleged violations [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  of Georgia state law that occurred when elections officials in Georgia were pressured and intimidated [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=26.56s)]
*  after the last presidential election that they should effectively falsify the results of that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=32.4s)]
*  state's election. It was a year ago, January 3rd last year, when the Washington Post published this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=38.32s)]
*  shocking audio recording of an extraordinary hour-long phone call that then-President Trump [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=45.2s)]
*  made personally to Georgia's top elections official telling him he needed to find [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=51.36s)]
*  exactly the number of votes in the state that would allow Trump to falsely be declared the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=57.04s)]
*  winner there. Now, in Georgia, as in every state in the country, pressuring elections officials to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=62.32s)]
*  interfere with the lawful administration of an election, pressuring election officials to change [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=68.88s)]
*  election results, that of course is a crime. This state prosecutor's office in Fulton County, Georgia [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=73.84s)]
*  opened that investigation under Georgia state law. Pressuring or intimidating election officials [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=81.6s)]
*  is a Georgia state crime. It's a crime in every state in the country, and of course, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=87.52s)]
*  it's also a federal crime. But while U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has made [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=91.52s)]
*  sort of vague patriotic statements about no one being above the law and federal prosecutors [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=97.84s)]
*  following the evidence wherever it leads, so far there's no evidence that federal prosecutors are [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=104.08s)]
*  investigating that call or any other reported instances of pressure that the president personally [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=108.56s)]
*  put on Georgia election officials about the conduct of their official duties. So far, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=115.36s)]
*  the only known criminal investigation into his efforts to falsify the election results [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=120.16s)]
*  anywhere in the country, the only known criminal investigation is that Georgia state investigation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=124.56s)]
*  And as of tonight, again, we can report that that investigation has now proceeded to the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=130.4s)]
*  point where President Trump's lawyers have started meeting in person with staff from the Fulton County [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=136.72s)]
*  prosecutor's office. And in fact, here's one more piece of it. You might remember in December, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=142.56s)]
*  in mid-December, sort of apparently apropos of nothing, former President Trump put out one of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=148.32s)]
*  his statements that are often hyperbolic. They can often seem a little bit unhinged, but this one was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  again, seemingly apropos of nothing. And it was specifically about prosecutors and investigators. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=161.2s)]
*  And even though his statements often seem unhinged, this seemed particularly unhinged even for him. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to read you the whole thing, but you will remember it. I'll read you a piece of it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  You will remember this is from, it is from December 18th. He said, quote, all the Democrats want to do [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=176.72s)]
*  is put people in jail. They are vicious, violent and radical left thugs. They are destroying [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=182.48s)]
*  people's lives, which is the only thing they are good at. Their DAs, attorney generals and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=188.64s)]
*  democratic law enforcement are out of control. Again, their DAs, AGs and democratic law enforcement [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=194.88s)]
*  are out of control. This is what happens in communist countries and dictatorships. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  The people of our country won't stand for it. That was December 18th from Trump. Whoa, girl, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=208.16s)]
*  calm down. What's this about? Easy now? Easy, easy. District attorneys and attorneys general [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=213.84s)]
*  and law enforcement. Oh my, they're ruining lives and it's communist dictatorships and the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=220.24s)]
*  people need to rise. What's going on? Well, we can report tonight that that seemingly sort of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=224.32s)]
*  unhinged statement from Trump decrying Democrat law enforcement. That statement happens within [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=231.52s)]
*  days of Trump's attorneys having their previously unreported in-person meeting with the prosecutors [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=239.44s)]
*  in Fulton County, Georgia, who are investigating Mr. Trump criminally for his alleged actions to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=246.64s)]
*  pressure election officials in that state. That statement again, within days of that previously [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=251.68s)]
*  unreported meeting by his attorneys in person with the Fulton County prosecutor's office. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=257.92s)]
*  Oh, maybe that's what he was so upset about. Joining us now is Gwen Keys-Fleming. She is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=263.92s)]
*  someone who has known Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis for many years. She is the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=270.32s)]
*  former district attorney of DeKalb County, which is right next to Fulton County. Ms. Fleming, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=273.76s)]
*  I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. Thank you. Absolutely. Thank you for having me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=278.56s)]
*  So we're reporting this news, I believe, for the first time. I'll stand corrected if it turns out [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=284.88s)]
*  that anybody else has reported this, but we think this might be the first time this news is being [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=289.44s)]
*  publicly reported. Can you tell us from the perspective of somebody who has been a district [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  attorney in Georgia, if there is anything at all that we should read into or we should see this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=300.32s)]
*  as a signifier for in terms of the state of the investigation, that the gentleman at the center [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  of the investigation, his attorneys are meeting in person with the prosecutor's office? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=313.2s)]
*  Well, I think it signals that things are moving along. I think the fact that defense counsel met [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=318.4s)]
*  with the prosecutors that in and of itself is not remarkable. That happens all the time in Georgia, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=322.72s)]
*  even before charges are filed, particularly in high profile cases where there may be speculation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=328.24s)]
*  I think what's interesting is the statements that we heard after that meeting. Like you said, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  there didn't appear to be context beforehand. But now as you look at this full picture and all of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=340.24s)]
*  the pieces and facts are coming together, it gives you a new life. And let me say, first of all, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  I had the pleasure of serving with elected district attorneys who were Republican, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=351.6s)]
*  elected district attorneys who were Democrat. And the one thing that is common among all of them [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  is not ever, can I ever point to a time where any of us made a decision to either prosecute [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  or dismiss a case based on our political affiliation or that of the person that we [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  were investigating? So the statements assigning a certain intention to Democrats versus Republicans [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  is just patently false. That does not happen. That is a violation of the oath of office. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=381.04s)]
*  And again, I think if you step back, you can begin to put things in context, particularly if [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=386.32s)]
*  you go back in history and think about the things that the former president said back in April of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=392.8s)]
*  2020 and the eight months leading up to the election where he decried a fair election. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=398.88s)]
*  He indicated that there was rampant fraud through mail-in voting and kept saying that the election [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  would be rigged. And you could see how those early statements then snowballed into what became the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=412.0s)]
*  big lie of him winning the election and Joe Biden losing. And so if you take that frame [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=418.64s)]
*  and apply it to these current statements, you can't help but wonder if this is the beginning [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  of a similar playbook where he is trying to undermine and create doubt in the integrity [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=431.2s)]
*  of the criminal justice system, just like he did the voting and election system. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I see what you mean, that this may be an effort because of what he's expecting to happen [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  in this investigation or potentially in others. He's trying to seed doubts and seed essentially [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=447.36s)]
*  a critical attitude among those who listen to him and believe him and support him that anybody who [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  does pursue some sort of prosecution or otherwise hurtful investigation of him [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=458.88s)]
*  is motivated by partisan means and therefore shouldn't be trusted. He's trying to essentially [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=464.48s)]
*  tilt or pre-spin what he expects to be negative outcomes from these investigations. Is that what [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=468.24s)]
*  you mean? That's exactly right, exactly right. The last time that we spoke, Ms. Fleming, we spoke [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  a few months ago about some reporting that the district attorney's office in Fulton County [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=481.28s)]
*  was considering impaneling a special grand jury in order to focus on this case. And obviously, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=488.32s)]
*  grand juries meet all the time. Grand juries consider every kind of case that a district [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  attorney has to handle. There was reporting several months ago that district attorney Fonny [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  Welles in Fulton County is considering impaneling a special grand jury to handle this matter. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=504.96s)]
*  We don't know if that has happened. There's no sign that that has happened. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=509.2s)]
*  Is there some sort of timeline that we should be keeping in mind in terms of when decisions [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=514.0s)]
*  like that would need to happen or when you would expect them to happen in terms of the life span of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=518.16s)]
*  this investigation? So let me point out, though, special grand juries are very different than [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  regular grand juries. Those are focused on criminal indictment, regular grand juries, and they [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=529.68s)]
*  turn over every two months. So a special grand jury does not produce indictments. It would produce [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=535.12s)]
*  a final report that would be critical in signaling what the citizens of Fulton County may or how [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=540.8s)]
*  they may be viewing the facts and evidence that was presented before them about this case. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=548.0s)]
*  But in terms of timing, it would need to be specially impaneled. The DA would need to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=552.96s)]
*  write a motion or submit a motion to the chief judge of Superior Court asking for the special [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=559.04s)]
*  grand jury. And then there would be really, I want to say no time limit on how long it could [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=565.52s)]
*  convene. That would all be dictated by the complexity of the case. And so I've had special [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  grand juries that were impaneled for a year because of the type of matters that we were looking at. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=579.6s)]
*  But what that does, it gives you a continuous group of dedicated citizens reviewing your evidence [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=585.76s)]
*  and they can look at the whole picture that every fact, every document, every tape, every witness [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  statement, every piece of the puzzle that paints the picture about what happened. And after [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=601.92s)]
*  reviewing all of that, they would write a report as to whether they thought there was sufficient [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=610.64s)]
*  evidence for criminal charges to be brought. And that would then give the district attorney [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  a leg to stand on, if you would, that her case was being evaluated by the actual citizens and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=621.68s)]
*  not just the folks in her office. If she made a motion to the chief judge of Superior Court, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=628.88s)]
*  as you said, in order to impanel such a special grand jury, would that be a public facing motion [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=634.4s)]
*  or would that be something that would be confidential? They usually are public facing. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=638.32s)]
*  Gwen Keese Fleming, thank you very much for your expertise here. It's absolutely invaluable to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=644.4s)]
*  have your help understanding these stories. Former District Attorney into Cab County, Georgia. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=649.04s)]
*  Ms. Fleming, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=653.04s)]
*  Glad to be here. Thank you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wsTq7X9AzQ&t=656.0s)]
