# 'The time is now to stand up!': Eric Holder sounds alarm on Trump's war on the rule of law
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk)
*  Joining us now for the interview tonight is former Attorney General of the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric Holder. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=3.74s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, it's really nice to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=4.74s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=6.74s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=8.46s)]
*  Glad to be here with you, Rachel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=10.42s)]
*  So I have a million things I want to talk to you about, as you might expect. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  I first want to get your reaction tonight to what we've seen from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=17.78s)]
*  There's this young man from Maryland, a father who was arrested by the Trump administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=21.86s)]
*  They sent him to a prison in El Salvador. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=28.04s)]
*  They say it was in error, but also they have no intention of getting him back. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=30.46s)]
*  The Supreme Court appears to have ruled tonight that they must bring him back, but also the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=34.1s)]
*  ruling is sort of hard to parse. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=40.48s)]
*  I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it yet or what your reaction is to it, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=42.1s)]
*  but I'd love to hear it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I've not had a chance to read thoroughly the opinion, but I think you can boil it down [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  and people, as lawyers do, we can start to parse words here and there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=53.379999999999995s)]
*  I think what the court is essentially saying is that, look, you admit that you made a mistake. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=57.6s)]
*  You took this guy without due process, placed him in a detention facility in El Salvador [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=62.8s)]
*  and are now saying that you can't get him back. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=68.32s)]
*  That is unacceptable, that this man is entitled to due process. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=71.32s)]
*  A determination has to be made as to whether or not he can be deported from the United [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=75.08s)]
*  States, and through due process, that is going through the court system, he has to have the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  ability to put forth any arguments that he has, and then a judge is going to have to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=84.94s)]
*  make a determination. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=89.58s)]
*  I think that is the clear input, that's the clear, that's the obvious thing that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=91.38s)]
*  the Supreme Court is saying. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  The question is going to be, now, how will the Trump administration react to that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  The court talks about facilitating, how are they going to interpret that? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Are they going to do it over the course of the next couple of days, the next month? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=108.38s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if we end up yet with another proceeding before the district [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=112.8s)]
*  court saying, the Supreme Court said the client had to be brought back, he's not here, we [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=117.8s)]
*  demand to have him brought back as soon as is possible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=123.72s)]
*  I want to ask you to reflect a little bit on what we're seeing in terms of the treatment [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  of immigrants right now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  I feel like, you know, I'm not a lawyer, I'm a person who pays attention to the news and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=135.0s)]
*  reports the news as best as I can, but I feel like my sort of moral tuning fork, I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=140.0s)]
*  guess it is, is resonating so hard I can hardly stand it in terms of the way that immigrants [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=149.1s)]
*  are being treated in one policy decision after another that all seem to rely on this basic [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=155.42s)]
*  sense that when it comes to the treatment of immigrants, there's really no law that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  constrains what the administration can do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  And so you're seeing student visas revoked, which they have the right to do, but you're [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=168.54s)]
*  seeing students not notified of that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=172.42s)]
*  And the first time they find out about it is when they're snatched off the street, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=174.68s)]
*  thrown into an unmarked car and put into a prison, when they had no idea they'd done [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=177.84s)]
*  anything wrong. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=182.1s)]
*  Tonight, we're seeing, I mean, we're seeing some of the fallout from this El Salvador [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=183.1s)]
*  decision to put people who have had no legal process whatsoever in a foreign prison with [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=187.22s)]
*  no recourse to American justice or even to answer to the non-charges against them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=195.22s)]
*  We're seeing reporting from the New York Times tonight that people who registered and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=199.54s)]
*  are in this country officially and essentially with the permission of the U.S. government [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=203.82s)]
*  under the CBP-1 app, they're having their Social Security numbers revoked, which instantly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=208.22s)]
*  makes them not only liable to arrest and deportation, but also makes it impossible for them to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=212.7s)]
*  continue to live in this country in any legal sense. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=220.02s)]
*  All of this just feels like they believe no law constrains them when it comes to people [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=222.9s)]
*  who aren't U.S. citizens. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=227.22s)]
*  And there's more that I could add to that universe. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=229.5s)]
*  But what is your reflection on that in terms of us as a country and how the administration [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  is treating these people among us? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, let's cut right through this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=238.94s)]
*  This is disgusting. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  It's shameful. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=244.06s)]
*  It's inconsistent with the rule of law. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=245.06s)]
*  And it's also inconsistent with who we say we are as a nation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=247.18s)]
*  Every American citizen, every inhabitant of this country, should be offended by what this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=251.62s)]
*  administration is doing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=257.3s)]
*  But beyond that, every citizen in this country ought to be afraid, because the reality is, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=258.86s)]
*  if they are successful in doing this to immigrants, and now they're doing things against American [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  citizens, as you talked about before, who criticize the president, it won't be too [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=268.86s)]
*  long—and the president himself has said he had no objections to taking convicted criminals [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  and putting them in the same jail in El Salvador, there is a treadmill that we're potentially [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=279.08s)]
*  getting on here that could result in the erosion of rights for American citizens. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=286.84s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying that's the only reason that we should be concerned about this. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=291.52s)]
*  People who are in this country deserve the ability to go before courts and have courts [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=295.52s)]
*  make determinations about whether they can stay, whether they should leave, how they [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=301.0s)]
*  should be treated. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=305.36s)]
*  And this administration wants to take upon itself, through the derogation of the ability [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  of the courts and certainly of the legislative branch, the ability to decide everything. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  This is how you get authoritarianism. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=315.8s)]
*  This is remarkably similar to kind of what happened in Europe in the 30s. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=318.22s)]
*  It's consistent with what we saw happen in Hungary and in Turkey in later days over [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  the course of the last 10, 15, 20 years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=329.66s)]
*  And that's not a path that this country wants to go down. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=332.8s)]
*  I want people to understand this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  If you don't stand up and fight now, if you don't take a position now, it's going to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=338.44s)]
*  be too late. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  We can't say we can wait just a little longer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=347.44s)]
*  No. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=348.44s)]
*  The time is now to stand up and do all that we can to fight this administration. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=349.44s)]
*  Now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=354.56s)]
*  Do you believe that the lawyers in this country, particularly the private sector lawyers of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=357.4s)]
*  big firms, are doing enough to stand up for the people who are at the sharp end of the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=363.36s)]
*  stick with this administration? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=367.28s)]
*  And I do mean the people who have been treated the worst. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=369.44s)]
*  I mean immigrants and I mean the trans community and I mean other people who have just had [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=371.88s)]
*  rights stripped from them even more aggressively than the rest of the country is experiencing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=375.88s)]
*  I feel like we're not seeing a rush to the barricades on behalf of the legal community [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=381.08s)]
*  in the way that we did in the first Trump administration. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=386.0s)]
*  And I think that's because the legal community, the big law in particular, is afraid of Trump [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=388.16s)]
*  and is trying to appease him rather than confront him. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  I wonder if you share that view. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=396.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=398.56s)]
*  Some are doing, I think, the right thing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=400.68s)]
*  Some are being timid. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  Some are showing themselves to be cowards. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  Some are making business determinations when they ought to be making legal decisions or [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=407.76s)]
*  putting into their decision making a sense of moral obligation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=413.48s)]
*  And I've been disappointed by some in the legal profession about the ways in which they [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=418.36s)]
*  have interacted with this administration. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=423.15999999999997s)]
*  You can't make deals with these folks. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=426.2s)]
*  This is an attack on the rule of law. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=428.8s)]
*  They want to go after people who are their critics. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=430.84s)]
*  They want to go after people who would defend those people, that is the lawyers. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=433.38s)]
*  They want to have a Justice Department that fires lawyers who tell the truth to judges. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=437.58s)]
*  They want to then go after the judges themselves. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=442.84s)]
*  This is all part of a peace. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  It's all about the erosion of the rule of law so that Donald Trump will have the ability [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=447.0s)]
*  to have authoritarian powers in this nation. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=452.56s)]
*  This is the person who the founders tried to put a system in place to prevent from coming [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=455.94s)]
*  to power. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=461.28s)]
*  And unless we as lawyers stand up, joined by the judiciary, and somehow, somehow get [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=462.55999999999995s)]
*  Congress to find out that it has power within our system of government, we will lose that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=470.16s)]
*  which defines this nation, that which makes this nation exceptional. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=478.8s)]
*  That is really what is at stake. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=483.76s)]
*  But you have to get granular. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=485.76s)]
*  And every lawyer, I think, has to ask him or herself, every law firm has to ask itself, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=487.88s)]
*  where do we stand? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=493.4s)]
*  It was an easy thing after George Floyd was murdered, when we had a videotape of a black [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  man with a cop with his knee on that man's throat as he was pleading for his life. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  It was an easy thing at that point, as horrible as that was, an easy thing to come and say [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=505.88s)]
*  that we were against that, we were for the rule of law, people like that cop need to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=509.9s)]
*  be held accountable. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  Now it's not so easy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  Now it's difficult. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=518.16s)]
*  And as Tom Paine said, you know, this is not the day of the Sunshine Patriot. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, this is the day of the Sunshine Patriot. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=524.0s)]
*  We have to make sure that when it gets tough, we're prepared to do the difficult things. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=525.48s)]
*  Some, some, unfortunately, I think too many, have made the determination that they're [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=531.72s)]
*  not willing to make the necessary sacrifices for the very system that has sustained them [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=536.32s)]
*  not only economically, but given them privileges that we as lawyers have. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=541.58s)]
*  It is our responsibility to stand up for the rule of law. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=546.2s)]
*  I hear the urgency in your, in your voice there. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=550.16s)]
*  I also believe that those who have made the weak decision thus far should know that it [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=553.76s)]
*  isn't a decision forever and they can, they can turn around. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=558.88s)]
*  They can recognize that they were wrong and turn that around. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=562.8599999999999s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, if you wouldn't mind holding on for one more moment. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  I have a lot more to ask you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=568.16s)]
*  Can you stick with us? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=569.52s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=570.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=571.52s)]
*  We'll be right back with more with former Attorney General Eric Holder. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=572.52s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=575.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPNp_E0a7Tk&t=579.68s)]
