**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao)
*  I'm sorry. It's Friday. I have worn through my filter. I just cannot even with this being [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=0.0s)]
*  the government of the United States of America. Let me let me just give you one more. All right. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=6.08s)]
*  This is also this week. You may recall that Trump appointed a pro wrestling executive named Linda [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=10.68s)]
*  to be the secretary of education Linda McMahon, right? Turn it out to be a weird job because [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=16.72s)]
*  both she and Donald Trump say that her job as secretary of education is to shut down the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=21.44s)]
*  Department of Education. Kind of a strange job. Still, though, Linda McMahon, Trump's education [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=27.12s)]
*  secretary, found time in her busy schedule to go to a conference this week, a conference on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=32.6s)]
*  artificial intelligence and American education. It's a whole conference about AI. Artificial [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=37.68s)]
*  intelligence AI. That's what we call it, right? AI AI. Unless you're Trump's education secretary, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=44.6s)]
*  in case that abbreviation AI turns out that's a really hard one. I heard I think it was a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=52.12s)]
*  letter or report that I heard this morning. I wish I could remember the source, but that there is a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=61.84s)]
*  school system that's going to start making sure that first graders or even pre-Ks have a one [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  teaching every year starting that far down in the grades. And that's just a that's a wonderful thing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=72.76s)]
*  See the other people on stage with her going, she's the secretary of education. She's talking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=78.68s)]
*  about what is what are we what are we talking about here? Or that first graders or even pre-Ks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=86.92s)]
*  have a one teaching every year starting that far down in the grades. And that's just a that's a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=99.4s)]
*  wonderful thing. Kids are sponges. They just absorb everything. And so wasn't all that long [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=105.92s)]
*  ago that as we're gonna have internet in our schools, whoop, now, okay, let's do see a one [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=111.88s)]
*  and how and how can that be helpful? Now, I myself, I love me some a one. It's tangy, really brings [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=116.72s)]
*  out the best in a steak or whatever. But a one, I mean, it's, it's not like an education term of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=129.0s)]
*  art, like K 12. Or something, right? Or, or pre-K, you know what I mean? Like, a one is a whole [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=137.0s)]
*  different thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=144.24s)]
*  Net in our schools whoop now, okay, let's do see a one and how and how can that be helpful? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=147.48s)]
*  How can that be helpful? How can that be helpful? So this is like, this is an anagram that you spell [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=154.24s)]
*  out. It's not like NASA, where you don't say N A S A, you just like pronounce the anagram as if it's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=161.08s)]
*  a word. This is the whole anagram spelled out. It's artificial intelligence, a, and then I AI. And [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  she cannot spell that. So now we've got tangy salty a one in all the schools. And that will [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=175.32s)]
*  somehow be facilitated by abolishing the US Department of Education, which, you know, it'll be [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=184.6s)]
*  delicious. I'm just, I mean, I can't. Everything they're doing is so terrible. I'm sorry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOQI3Roao&t=192.56s)]
