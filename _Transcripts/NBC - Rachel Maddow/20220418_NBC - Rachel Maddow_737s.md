# 'Eliminationist Rhetoric,' A Fascist Tool, Gains Alarming Foothold In Trump-Era Politics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68)
*  In 1936, 1937, 1938, Joseph Stalin decided he was going to consolidate his power, consolidate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=0.0s)]
*  his hold on the Soviet Union by executing everybody he thought was in his way. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=7.28s)]
*  It's now known as the Great Purge or the Great Terror. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=13.36s)]
*  And it wasn't just like Stalin eliminating other political elites he thought might be [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=16.96s)]
*  in line for his job. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=21.18s)]
*  Stalin ordered the killing of hundreds of thousands of people, by some estimates more [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  than a million people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=27.52s)]
*  And thanks to the records historians started to get access to right after the collapse [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=30.36s)]
*  of the Soviet Union, in the mid to late 90s, historians were finally able to pinpoint a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=34.64s)]
*  previously unknown site inside Russia, northern Russia, where as many as 9,000 people had [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  been shot in the Great Purge and buried. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=47.0s)]
*  Just a huge site, an unmarked site with hundreds of burial pits, 236 different pits, and more [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  containing more than 9,000 bodies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  They didn't find it until the summer of 1997. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=60.76s)]
*  And once they found it, they put up these stones, these markers, to commemorate it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=64.2s)]
*  They turned it into a memorial for the victims of Stalin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=70.64s)]
*  They started to hold an annual day of remembrance there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=73.72s)]
*  After about 20 years though, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided that that was enough, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=79.2s)]
*  and he didn't want any more of that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=83.68s)]
*  Putin broadly decided that Stalin had gotten a bad rap. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  The Soviet Union broadly got a bad rap. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  Stalin in particular got a bad rap. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  You know, what benefit is there in all this supposed history, all these stories that make [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=93.48s)]
*  him seem like such a bad guy, that make the Soviet Union seem so flawed? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=97.28s)]
*  Let's restore the glory, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Sure, millions dead, but those people aren't around to tell their stories anymore. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=103.4s)]
*  So why should any of us tell that story, let alone hear it? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=107.76s)]
*  And so, the historian who had first located that site in northern Russia, he was arrested. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=111.16s)]
*  They charged him with being a pedophile. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=118.16s)]
*  The Russian government then announced plans to bring bulldozers into that site. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=121.84s)]
*  They were going to dig up the bodies and show that this wasn't a mass burial site of Stalin's victims. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=126.12s)]
*  This must have been something else entirely. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  The victims there must all have been Russians who were killed by foreigners. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Because of course, there was no gulag, there was no great terror, there was no great purge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=137.32s)]
*  Stalin was a stand-up guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Russia's history is pristine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=143.12s)]
*  Anybody who says otherwise is obviously a degenerate, a monster. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=145.12s)]
*  After the historian who heroically tracked down the records and discovered that site, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=150.72s)]
*  after he was locked up and charged randomly with pedophilia, they did the same thing to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=156.32s)]
*  the head of the local museum, who would effectively arrest him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=162.24s)]
*  who had effectively been the on-site caretaker for the site once it was discovered. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=166.64s)]
*  He had also been vocal in his opposition to the Russian government coming in and digging it up with bulldozers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=171.64s)]
*  He too, they did the same thing to him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=177.04s)]
*  They arrested him and charged him with being a pedophile. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  In both cases, the charges were widely believed to be trumped up and completely false, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=184.04s)]
*  but they were nevertheless loudly trumpeted on Russian state TV. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=188.64s)]
*  And the association they were trying to make was clear. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=193.04s)]
*  You want to expose something about Russia's very dark past? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=196.64s)]
*  Well, obviously you're a degenerate and a monster. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Not even a regular criminal, not even a regular person who's just wrong, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  not even just a regular criminal, but a monster who must be destroyed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=207.44s)]
*  That local historian who ran the museum near the burial site, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=214.64s)]
*  he was like the de facto caretaker for the burial site, he spoke out against bulldozing it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=217.64s)]
*  It was widely understood that the allegations against him were ridiculous and completely false. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=222.44s)]
*  But they did their job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=229.24s)]
*  They got, they served as a pretext for locking him up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=230.84s)]
*  He ended up dying in prison, never saw freedom again. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=234.84s)]
*  With those guys out of the way, the Russian government has taken down the memorial at the site. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=240.84s)]
*  They've re-designated the whole burial site as a sightseeing locale. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=245.24s)]
*  It used to be a heritage site because of the mass murder that happened there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=249.44s)]
*  They've re-designated it now as a national sightseeing locale. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=253.84s)]
*  Yeah, what a nice forest. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=258.04s)]
*  What a great spot for a picnic. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=259.64s)]
*  What are all these big square pits? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=261.04s)]
*  Before he became what he is now, which is basically dictator for life, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=266.24s)]
*  in the late 90s, Vladimir Putin was head of the FSB. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=270.84s)]
*  He was head of the FSB when Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia in the late 90s. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=275.84s)]
*  And Yeltsin, like lots of Russian leaders, had a corruption problem. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=280.84s)]
*  More specifically, the problem Yeltsin had in 1997 was that there was a prosecutor in Russia [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  who was investigating corruption at the highest levels in the Kremlin, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=290.44s)]
*  including Yeltsin and his family. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=293.64s)]
*  And for a time, it seemed like that corruption investigation might be the undoing of Yeltsin [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=295.64s)]
*  and his family and his cronies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=300.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, as head of the FSB, took care of that problem for Boris Yeltsin. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=303.84s)]
*  Putin arranged for a video to be broadcast on national television that showed the prosecutor, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  or somebody who maybe kind of looked like the prosecutor, in bed with not one but two young, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=315.84s)]
*  very young females. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=322.44s)]
*  The video was low enough quality and it was shot from sort of oblique enough angles [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=325.23999999999995s)]
*  that you couldn't necessarily tell with the naked eye who this grown man was with these girls in this bed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=330.04s)]
*  But Putin stepped up. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=337.04s)]
*  In his authority as head of the FSB, Vladimir Putin assured the Russian public [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=338.44s)]
*  that he could guarantee that the man in the video was, in fact, that prosecutor. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=344.04s)]
*  And so that was the end of that prosecutor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=351.04s)]
*  And that was the end of the corruption investigation into Boris Yeltsin and his family. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=353.24s)]
*  And in gratitude, or at least in payback, Boris Yeltsin decided that he would name, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=357.64s)]
*  as the next prime minister of Russia and then the next president of Russia, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=362.44s)]
*  that FSB guy who helped him out, Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  That's how Vladimir Putin rose to power in the first place in Russia. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=370.84s)]
*  That's how he got control of the Russian government. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=374.64s)]
*  By generating, effectively, a false pedophilia claim against just the right guy at just the right moment. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=378.84s)]
*  That's how he got into power. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  Pedophilia, of course, is the most repulsive of all human behavior. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=389.84s)]
*  It is so repulsive. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=395.23999999999995s)]
*  It is so evil that it makes us see red. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=397.23999999999995s)]
*  And it is almost literally unthinkable. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=401.23999999999995s)]
*  And it therefore, understandably, can make us stop seeing anybody who's even accused of it [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=405.84s)]
*  as our fellow human. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=414.64s)]
*  Anybody abetting it or even abiding it, it's basically the same thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=416.44s)]
*  Your brain just instantly goes to monster, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=420.24s)]
*  Understandably, as it is the most repulsive of all human evil. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=425.24s)]
*  And when confronted with it, we almost can't process it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=432.64s)]
*  And it is a deep dark thing to recognize that about human nature, right? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=438.44s)]
*  To differentiate the capacity of some people for that behavior, for that level of evil, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=441.44s)]
*  and our collective massive human revulsion and rejection of that evil. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=445.44s)]
*  But recognizing that, to decide that you're going to try to harness that for political gain, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=454.44s)]
*  that you're going to make false accusations of that kind, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=461.44s)]
*  systematically to reduce your political opponents to non-human status, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=465.44s)]
*  that is a horrific abuse of its own. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=470.44s)]
*  And it has become one of the hallmarks of modern authoritarianism. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=473.44s)]
*  Not only in Russia, but especially in Russia under Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=477.44s)]
*  It's an obvious and frequent enough political tactic in Putin's Russia that in 2016, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=482.44s)]
*  not long after our bizarre 2016 presidential election, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=488.44s)]
*  the New York Times ran a feature on how this particular tactic kept coming up increasingly in Putin's Russia. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=492.44s)]
*  You see the headline there. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=499.44s)]
*  Fauxes of Russia say child pornography is planted to ruin them. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=500.44s)]
*  It's so evil. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=506.44s)]
*  It's so like meta level, exploitative and evil and base and cynical. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=508.44s)]
*  But of course they use it, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=514.44s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been in power 22 years now in Russia. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=518.44s)]
*  And that particularly sick hallmark of his time in power has been a constant. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=522.44s)]
*  He has used it against all different kinds of political opponents. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=528.44s)]
*  And it always works. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=531.44s)]
*  During the Trump years here, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=535.44s)]
*  we started to get the conspiracy theory cult version of it on the political right here in America. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=538.44s)]
*  The QAnon pro-Trump online cult built its whole bizarre central conspiracy theory [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=545.44s)]
*  around these same kinds of false and fantastical claims [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=551.44s)]
*  that everybody in the world who isn't Trump is allied in some big satanic pedophilia ring. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=555.44s)]
*  And someday Trump will catch them all and bring on mass public executions of all the Democrats and all the celebrities [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=561.44s)]
*  and then finally will be free from the satanic pedophile conspiracy that runs the world. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=568.44s)]
*  That's the basic idea of the bizarre pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory cult. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=573.44s)]
*  And on the one hand, it is freakish, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=579.44s)]
*  It is truly bizarre. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=582.44s)]
*  It is a conspiracy theory cult and you have to be like an extremism anthropologist to understand any of it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=584.44s)]
*  On the other hand, it's been remarkably persistent during the Trump era in American conservative politics. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=590.44s)]
*  And it does have this clear political point, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=597.44s)]
*  which is why authoritarian movements and dictators do some version of this all over the world. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=601.44s)]
*  It's what some political scientists call eliminationist rhetoric. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=607.44s)]
*  It's one thing for you to be competing in a democracy against your political opponents, right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=612.44s)]
*  Against fellow human beings who have different ideas about governing and may the best candidate win. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=618.44s)]
*  It's another thing if everybody on the other side of you in politics is inhuman, is a monster, a beast, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=623.44s)]
*  who you have to protect children from, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=632.44s)]
*  And who must be eliminated if we are ever to have any sort of civilization, right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=634.44s)]
*  You don't compete against a monster in an election. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=639.44s)]
*  You destroy them, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=643.44s)]
*  You call for their public execution. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=645.44s)]
*  And when it comes to power, the idea that you'd let one of these monsters have power [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=647.44s)]
*  because if something is small and pointless and beside the point is them winning an election, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=652.44s)]
*  well, that's unthinkable. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=656.44s)]
*  The election is much less important than keeping the monsters at bay. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=657.44s)]
*  Eliminationist rhetoric. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=661.44s)]
*  Playing with these kinds of false accusations, this kind of false accusation in particular, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=666.44s)]
*  it is lurid and disgusting and shocking and bizarre, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=671.44s)]
*  but it is also playing with the worst kind of fire in terms of what we are capable of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=678.44s)]
*  in our understandable human nature. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=684.44s)]
*  Because, you know, for people who believe these kinds of false allegations, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=687.44s)]
*  even for people who don't necessarily believe them explicitly, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=692.44s)]
*  but they ambiently absorb that these are the kinds of accusations [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=695.44s)]
*  that are circulating out there about people in politics, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=698.44s)]
*  I mean, that can be used to justify almost any level of extreme response, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=701.44s)]
*  any level of violence even in response. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=705.44s)]
*  That's why it's a dictator's tactic. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=709.44s)]
*  That is why it is a fascist authoritarian tactic. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK7dyKUW-68&t=712.44s)]
