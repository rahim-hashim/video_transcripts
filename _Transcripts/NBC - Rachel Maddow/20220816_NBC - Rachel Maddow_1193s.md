# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 15
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw)
*  On Friday, we learned from the unsealing of a Justice Department search warrant that it is an inquiry under the Espionage Act [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=0.0s)]
*  that led the FBI to execute a search warrant at former President Trump's property in South Florida last week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's an amazing thing. Files seized from former president are part of Espionage Act inquiry. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=12.56s)]
*  I mean, go back in time and try to convince your grandparents and your great-grandparents [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=20.04s)]
*  that this is the America that we inherited from them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=25.44s)]
*  Files seized from former president part of Espionage Act inquiry. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=28.28s)]
*  What it meant specifically when we learned that is that that search warrant that they unsealed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=32.96s)]
*  cited a portion of the Espionage Act that concerns the handling of national security information [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=37.8s)]
*  that could harm the United States or help our enemies. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=43.32s)]
*  To get even more specific, what it means is that, you know, to get that warrant to search Trump's house in Florida, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=47.32s)]
*  prosecutors had to prove to the satisfaction of a federal judge that the FBI was not just a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  satisfaction of a federal judge, that there was probable cause to believe that at Trump's home, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=56.8s)]
*  they would find evidence that that part of the Espionage Act had been violated, that that crime had been committed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=61.12s)]
*  Now, the first question that raised for many of us was, I mean, the really first question was like, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=70.72s)]
*  is this real? Am I dead? Is this actually my life? Next question was, is that it? Is this the end of it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=75.88s)]
*  Certain specificity to the question of whether that search warrant might itself have been the end of the matter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=82.76s)]
*  By which I mean, were they using the search warrant to collect that material that Trump wasn't supposed to have? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=90.68s)]
*  But then basically once they had, once they've retrieved the material from him, is it basically case closed? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times put it this way last week in print. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=104.56s)]
*  They said, quote, it is not clear whether the search was carried out simply to ensure that the documents and other material [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=108.52s)]
*  were properly turned over to the archives or whether it was a possible precursor to a prosecution of Mr. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=114.16s)]
*  Trump for mishandling classified materials or obstructing efforts to get it back. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=120.32s)]
*  In other words, did federal prosecutors get that search warrant because they believed that Trump wasn't handing over all [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=125.16s)]
*  the sensitive material that he had. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=131.76s)]
*  So they use the warrant basically to just go get the stuff back by force. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  And now that's it. That's the end of it. That's as far as they want it to go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=137.44s)]
*  Or did they go get the material using the search warrant as part of an investigation that is not over now that they've got the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=141.88s)]
*  stuff that is pointing in the end toward possible criminal charges for whoever is responsible for this breach? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  Which is, does the search warrant just to get the stuff or was the search warrant to lead to a potential criminal case? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, in a filing tonight in federal court, the Justice Department explains that it's the latter, that it is not over now that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=164.56s)]
*  they've gone and snatched back all the classified and top secret information that the former president inexplicably had stashed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=171.84s)]
*  in his basement. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=178.56s)]
*  Tonight in a filing explaining to the court why the Justice Department doesn't want to release further information about their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=179.84s)]
*  case at this time, the Justice Department says in this filing that the search warrant wasn't the end of it, that it's just part of an [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=186.16s)]
*  ongoing investigation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=194.44s)]
*  They use that term repeatedly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=195.88s)]
*  Here, the government has a compelling, overriding interest in preserving the integrity of an ongoing criminal investigation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  Disclosure at this juncture of the affidavit supporting probable cause would cause significant and irreparable damage to this ongoing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=204.84s)]
*  criminal investigation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=211.72s)]
*  Quote, if disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government's ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=213.32s)]
*  direction and likely course in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  That's all in the Justice Department's court filing tonight. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=228.48s)]
*  And what we learn from that court filing is that the Justice Department is expecting further investigative steps. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=231.2s)]
*  They are contemplating further investigative steps and what they repeatedly describe as an ongoing criminal investigation, an ongoing [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=236.96s)]
*  criminal investigation, quote, that implicates national security. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=244.4s)]
*  So, again, one of the main questions about what is going on here is now answered by the Justice Department's filing this evening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=250.36s)]
*  The point of that search warrant last week was not just to go and get the stuff and now they've got it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=259.04s)]
*  It can be safely put back under lock and key and case closed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=263.76s)]
*  No, the search warrant we now know was to get that stuff, but it is also part of an ongoing criminal investigation that could lead to criminal [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=268.08s)]
*  charges, an ongoing criminal investigation involving the Espionage Act and the former president, which is astonishing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=274.68s)]
*  And for him, of course, that's bad. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=282.0s)]
*  Now, in that Georgia case, the other people who've received target letters, the other people who've been told to expect that they may be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=284.64s)]
*  indicted in that criminal case, they're all people besides Rudy Giuliani who are implicated in the fake electors plot, this plot to send in forged [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=292.12s)]
*  documents naming fake electors for Trump in states that are not in the criminal investigation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  It's also a matter under federal criminal investigation as well. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=306.96s)]
*  Theres' one thing I think worth pointing out about that that I think has been lost by so many of these gonzo headlines that today's news. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=311.88s)]
*  Remember, how we learned about the fake electors scheme in the test and the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=319.84s)]
*  incarnations of the great tax law and those minutes? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=321.32s)]
*  It is exactly what happened at Gallaudet when Donald Trumprei saw charges claiming the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  American Black Federal Congress. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  Rice clearly fielded false weapons and criminal evidence by the Republican Jon pleasantries. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=329.4s)]
*  Remember how we learned about the fake electors scheme, how we learned about how it came together [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=334.34s)]
*  and how we learned about it being under federal investigation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=338.94s)]
*  You might remember about the fake electors that it sort of started as something that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=342.5s)]
*  looked like a bunch of disparate efforts in disparate states. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=347.64s)]
*  Some people pretending to be electors who weren't really electors in Georgia. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  Another group trying to do the same thing in Michigan. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  Another group trying to do it but sort of differently in the state of Arizona. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=359.05999999999995s)]
*  It looked different in a whole bunch of different states when that happened and when that first [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=363.6s)]
*  came to public attention. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=367.48s)]
*  That matter, the fake electors thing, appears to have become a federal criminal investigation [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=370.04s)]
*  rather than just an investigation in individual states. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  When it became apparent that this thing wasn't just spontaneously happening in multiple states, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  it was an organized thing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  The Trump campaign and other people around President Trump organized that effort around [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=385.22s)]
*  the country. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=389.6s)]
*  It wasn't just disparate things that were happening in different states at the same [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=390.6s)]
*  time sort of by happenstance, by coincidence, it was an organized central top-down effort. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  That is the pattern that we saw happen with the fake electors thing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=401.98s)]
*  Today that same pattern started to become apparent in another thing they did to try [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=405.32000000000005s)]
*  to overturn the election results. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=410.0s)]
*  Specifically the effort to grab voting machines, to seize supposedly secure voting equipment [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=411.72s)]
*  and tabulators in multiple states even though that equipment is very highly regulated and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  is only supposed to have, people are only supposed to have access to it under very tightly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  controlled circumstances. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=429.5s)]
*  Now there have been criminal charges brought already in the state of Colorado for Trump [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  folks seizing and corrupting voting equipment there. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=435.32s)]
*  Same thing is under criminal investigation in multiple jurisdictions in Michigan as well. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=439.28s)]
*  But now today the Washington Post reports that in Colorado, in Michigan, in Nevada, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  in Georgia and a whole bunch of states, these folks messing with the voting equipment apparently [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=449.54s)]
*  weren't just spontaneously acting on their own to illegally access all this equipment [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=455.06s)]
*  they weren't supposed to be able to touch. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=459.62s)]
*  They didn't just all have the same idea all at once independently, coincidentally. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=461.76s)]
*  The Washington Post reports today in something of a bombshell that just like with the fake [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=466.42s)]
*  this one too appears to have been a centrally coordinated effort run by people close to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=471.76s)]
*  Trump including at least one Trump campaign lawyer. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  Again, with the fake electors thing, it was evidence of the Trump campaign's involvement, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=481.44s)]
*  their national coordination of what otherwise looked like disparate efforts in a whole bunch [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=487.56s)]
*  of states. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=491.4s)]
*  That's apparently what led to the now ongoing federal criminal investigation of the fake [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  electors scheme. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=497.36s)]
*  As of today, the Washington Post reports that there was a similar central organized effort [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  running these schemes to seize and corrupt secure voting machines in multiple states [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=504.44s)]
*  and that it was linked to the Trump campaign. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  So you know, all of us have been trying to track all these things. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=514.04s)]
*  We're all going to have to like add another column to the billboard sized spreadsheets [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=517.64s)]
*  we're all maintaining now trying to keep track of the various criminal investigations [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=521.72s)]
*  that surround the last president. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=525.46s)]
*  Joining us now for his first US television interview is veteran former espionage prosecutor [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=529.48s)]
*  and former member of Robert Mueller's team. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=538.52s)]
*  He worked on the prosecutions of Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=540.52s)]
*  His name is Brandon Van Graak. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=543.4s)]
*  Mr. Van Graak, it's a real pleasure to meet you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=545.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=546.72s)]
*  Nice to meet you as well. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=547.72s)]
*  First of all, thank you for doing this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=548.72s)]
*  I know you don't do this, so I'm very grateful that you've decided to be here. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=550.04s)]
*  I want to talk to you about a lot of things in your career, but I want to start with the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=554.08s)]
*  national discourse right now around this investigation involving the search warrant at the president's [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  home in South Florida. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=563.32s)]
*  The headlines that say this is an inquiry under the Espionage Act continuing to blow [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=565.48s)]
*  everybody's minds. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  I still find it to be almost impossible to look at those headlines and not see this as [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  a movie and see this as real life. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  But as somebody who's actually worked in the nitty gritty around this part of the law, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  what should we understand about the seriousness here? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=581.12s)]
*  Do you feel like any of the national discourse around it is wrong or overblown? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=586.0s)]
*  It's a really important point because right now there is a focus on what is the end game. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=591.96s)]
*  Is someone going to be charged? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=599.04s)]
*  You don't need to get to that point to appreciate the fact that there is serious national security [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  implications from the conduct and the information just before us. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=606.96s)]
*  It's just from the receipt of the search warrant. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  There are multiple series of documents that are classified, that are labeled top secret, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=614.28s)]
*  that were in unsecured locations for 19 months. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=620.0s)]
*  We already know the fact that there were classified documents that were provided to the archives [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=623.44s)]
*  seven months before that. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=628.4s)]
*  You don't need to take any more leaps beyond that to appreciate the fact that there's real [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=630.2s)]
*  national security harm and potential damage caused by that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=635.1s)]
*  Right now, the intelligence community is sorting through that information and doing a damage [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=638.6800000000001s)]
*  assessment, trying to assess what sources and methods have been compromised. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=643.04s)]
*  That's separate from whether in fact anyone is charged. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=647.04s)]
*  It's important that we don't get too far ahead of what's in front of us. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=650.56s)]
*  One of the things that's been described by reporters, and I'm not quite sure that I totally [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=653.56s)]
*  understand that. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=657.76s)]
*  I think I get it in my head but not in my gut, is that the Justice Department's reference [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=658.76s)]
*  to the potential statutes that are implicated here. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=663.08s)]
*  I keep hearing it described that it doesn't necessarily matter, that the way they are [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=666.24s)]
*  citing statutory law, doesn't necessarily matter if Trump believes that he declassified [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=670.24s)]
*  those documents. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=675.08s)]
*  That the technical classification status of those documents wouldn't necessarily impact [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=676.08s)]
*  whether or not charges could be brought on those statutes. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=680.84s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment, looking at what we've seen in the search warrant? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=683.36s)]
*  Can you explain it? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=686.24s)]
*  Yeah, so I think that that might be technically true, but in reality, I think ultimately if [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=687.24s)]
*  in fact this material was declassified, I think it would have a material impact on whether [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  charges are brought. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=697.84s)]
*  So the charge referenced in the Espionage Act, it concerns the mishandling and retention [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=698.84s)]
*  of classified information. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  It's 18 United States Code 793. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=706.0400000000001s)]
*  And the language in the statute says the retention of national defense information, and that's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=708.64s)]
*  defined through years of case law. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=714.24s)]
*  It doesn't say classified information. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=716.12s)]
*  But for all intents and purposes, the Justice Department considers that to be classified [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=717.96s)]
*  information. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=723.0400000000001s)]
*  There's only one case in its history where information that was not classified information [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=724.0400000000001s)]
*  was charged, and that was actually a plea agreement. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=728.52s)]
*  So it wasn't sort of tested. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=730.56s)]
*  And so for all intents and purposes, if the Department of Justice believes or has reason [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  to believe that this information was declassified, and we don't know that, then it is very unlikely [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=736.72s)]
*  that that what's called a retention case, that the retention charge would occur. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=742.04s)]
*  Now, with respect to the other two charges that were mentioned in the search warrant, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  there was one concerning obstruction and another concerning the removal of ultimately presidential [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=750.72s)]
*  records. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=755.3199999999999s)]
*  That also doesn't have a connection to classified information. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=756.7s)]
*  So it doesn't technically matter. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=759.38s)]
*  But ultimately, the motive and intent behind the removal of the information or the obstruction [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=761.34s)]
*  does matter. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=766.98s)]
*  And so if people involved in the process did believe they were declassified, that matters. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=768.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean that therefore it precludes a criminal prosecution on those two statutes. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=774.22s)]
*  But the point is it's matter and it's relevant. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=778.88s)]
*  And so I don't think simply saying it's immaterial is the right way to view the charges. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=781.64s)]
*  If the person in question here, one of the people in question here is potentially in [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=787.06s)]
*  trouble because of the way these documents were handled, is the former president, is [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=790.9s)]
*  there a way to divine his intent for the purpose of deciding whether charges are warranted [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=796.48s)]
*  without interviewing him? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=803.42s)]
*  So the reality is if he's the target of an investigation, there isn't going to be an [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=805.38s)]
*  interview. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=812.32s)]
*  I mean, that just... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=813.32s)]
*  And we do know from the information that you discussed in the top of the hour that there's [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=814.32s)]
*  a discussion in the government's recent filing in terms of the decision not to unseal the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=818.76s)]
*  affidavit that there are witnesses who are cooperating in the investigation. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=824.92s)]
*  They specifically say that's a basis for not unsealing the affidavit. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=828.84s)]
*  So there are certainly people in the orbit that would have information that would be [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=832.4s)]
*  relevant to understanding intent and motive. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  One of the things that arose today in the news was a claim by former President Trump [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=839.76s)]
*  that his passports went walkies during the search warrant, during the execution of the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  search warrant. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=849.48s)]
*  He described them as being stolen by the FBI. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=850.84s)]
*  There's later reporting suggesting that these were perhaps that his passports were taken [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=853.36s)]
*  as part of the search execution of the search warrant and then returned to him. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=857.96s)]
*  What should we understand about that? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=861.12s)]
*  So a couple pieces, which is first, there's a lot of noise that happens in these investigations. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=863.24s)]
*  And it's really important that we're not distracted by the cacophony and really focus on the important [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=868.84s)]
*  information. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=874.36s)]
*  And that goes to my earlier point, which is just based on what we know, there are significant [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=875.36s)]
*  national security implications behind what happened. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=880.0400000000001s)]
*  With respect to the passport, if that is in fact true, if in fact there were multiple [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  passports of the former president taken, there's really not much to read into that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=886.98s)]
*  It is unlikely that the Department of Justice is signaling that the former president is [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=891.0s)]
*  a flight risk. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=895.8s)]
*  It is unlikely that the Department of Justice is signaling that criminal charges are eminent. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=896.8s)]
*  More likely, again, if it is in fact true, it is simply responsive to the search warrant. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=901.84s)]
*  The search warrant specifically said it can seize presidential records. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=906.64s)]
*  And so perhaps the FBI believed, I don't know rightly or wrongly, that these passports [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=910.32s)]
*  were presidential records. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=914.6s)]
*  There's also in the search warrant, it says information that's commingled with the classified [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=916.56s)]
*  information should be seized. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=920.58s)]
*  And so for all we know, these passports were commingled. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=922.1s)]
*  But talking about something that ultimately I don't think is significant, if for any reason [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=925.86s)]
*  the denial of these passports impaired the president's ability to travel, I'm certain [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=931.1s)]
*  that a simple call from the president's lawyers to the Department of Justice would resolve [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=935.62s)]
*  that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=939.7s)]
*  So ultimately, I think it's a distraction and it's important because there are some [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=940.7s)]
*  real serious issues here that we don't get distracted by. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=943.2s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's like you see the government has his passports and you [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=946.78s)]
*  immediately go to the issue of law and order where the guy gets arrested and his passports [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=951.66s)]
*  are seized because he's seen as a flight risk, but there's nothing here to indicate that [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=956.5799999999999s)]
*  connection. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=960.18s)]
*  And look, there are instances where passports do get seized, but that is when someone is [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=961.18s)]
*  about to be charged or has been charged. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=964.6999999999999s)]
*  And there's no indication that we've reached that point in an investigation. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=967.6999999999999s)]
*  I also wanted to ask you about the news reported in the New York Times this weekend that President [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=970.66s)]
*  Trump, through an intermediary, appears to have tried to reach out to the attorney general [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=976.54s)]
*  after this search warrant was executed, obviously, and after the attorney general, around the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=982.06s)]
*  time the attorney general is making his decision to both speak publicly about it and to ask [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  for the search warrant to be unsealed. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=991.86s)]
*  Just from the perspective of somebody who's in the Justice Department at the kind of levels [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=995.5799999999999s)]
*  that you worked at, is that wrong? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=998.38s)]
*  Is that weird? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1001.06s)]
*  Is that appropriate? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1002.06s)]
*  Is that normal? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1003.06s)]
*  How do you view that? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1004.06s)]
*  I guess I view it as irrelevant. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1005.06s)]
*  The reality is there are probably outreaches that occur to senior levels of the government [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1007.9399999999999s)]
*  Department of Justice all the time. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1013.54s)]
*  This is something where I cannot see or think of a situation where an outreach like that [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1015.54s)]
*  will have any impact on the investigation. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1020.5s)]
*  And so appropriate or not, again, I don't think it will have any impact on the investigation. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1022.66s)]
*  And again, really, I would consider it to be noise or a distraction when the fact is, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1027.9s)]
*  again, there are real national security issues at play, and that really should be the focus. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1032.18s)]
*  Let me ask you about another thing, which may just be a distraction, but from the outside [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1036.3000000000002s)]
*  it seems at least fraught. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1039.5800000000002s)]
*  We've now seen three Trump White House lawyers, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, his [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1042.42s)]
*  deputy Pat Philbin, and now today we learned Eric Hirschman, all White House lawyers working [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1047.6200000000001s)]
*  for the president, all having received subpoenas from the Justice Department. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1051.6200000000001s)]
*  We don't exactly know the topic. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1055.88s)]
*  We don't even know which grand jury. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1057.02s)]
*  There's a lot of different investigations. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1058.42s)]
*  That itself is remarkable. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1060.06s)]
*  We've also seen a member of Congress had his phone seized as part of an investigation in [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1062.02s)]
*  which he is reportedly has been told he's a witness and not a target. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1066.42s)]
*  When you're talking about White House lawyers and serving members of Congress and these [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1071.06s)]
*  sorts of people who aren't typically caught up in the work of the Justice Department, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  how does that influence you? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1079.62s)]
*  Your decisions as a prosecutor, as an investigator, knowing that people with a lot of political [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1080.86s)]
*  power and people working in sensitive political jobs are in your sights? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1085.18s)]
*  Well, I think one of the signals from the attorney general of the Justice Department, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1088.42s)]
*  which is really important to stress, is that ultimately those considerations really are [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1093.02s)]
*  not having an impact. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1098.16s)]
*  And that's in multiple investigations. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1099.66s)]
*  In fact, I think there's also reporting today indicating that the search warrant with respect [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1101.3400000000001s)]
*  to Mar-a-Lago was sitting with the attorney general for a period of time and that he was [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1105.52s)]
*  wrestling with it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1109.76s)]
*  I think what we can say, even though I think it's common for there to be disagreement [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1111.26s)]
*  in some of the actions from the Department of Justice, that all of the actions we're [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1115.58s)]
*  talking about are not influenced by political considerations. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1119.02s)]
*  And there really is no appearance of political influence in these decisions. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1122.54s)]
*  And I think that is such a critical issue for the Department of Justice. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1126.46s)]
*  I mean, really, if you take a step back and appreciate when you talk about the Department [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1130.62s)]
*  of Justice, it is foundational to the legitimacy of the government to exercise its authority. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1134.8999999999999s)]
*  It is a department that has the ability to deprive an individual of their liberty. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1140.6599999999999s)]
*  And so the legitimacy of that department is paramount. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1145.8s)]
*  And I think the attorney general not only appreciates that, but you can see through [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1149.02s)]
*  his words and deeds that that is a constant theme in how he acts. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMC0xd9JMQw&t=1152.5s)]
