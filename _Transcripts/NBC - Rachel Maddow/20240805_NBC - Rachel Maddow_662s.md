# 'Where did the cash go?': Maddow looks for clues in new report about Trump, Egypt and $10 million
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8)
*  I cannot improve on the opening lines of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just going to give it to you verbatim. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=3.6s)]
*  Ready? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Quote, five days before Donald Trump became president in January 2017, a manager at a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  bank branch in Cairo, Egypt received an unusual letter from an organization linked to the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=11.92s)]
*  Egyptian intelligence service. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=17.52s)]
*  The letter asked the bank to quote, kindly withdraw nearly $10 million from the organization's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=20.32s)]
*  account, withdraw it all in cash, as in green bills. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=26.48s)]
*  Quote, inside the state-run National Bank of Egypt, employees were soon busy placing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  bundles of $100 bills into two large bags. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=37.04s)]
*  Four men arrived and carried away the bags, which weighed a combined 200 pounds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=42.16s)]
*  The bags contained what was then a sizable share of Egypt's entire reserve of American [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=47.36s)]
*  currency. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  But when those four men came and carried away those hundreds of pounds of cash, bundles [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=55.0s)]
*  of $100 bills, where did the cash go? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=59.76s)]
*  What could Egypt's intelligence service possibly need with 200 pounds of $100 bills? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=64.6s)]
*  Well, FBI agents in the United States thought that cash might have gone to Donald Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=70.8s)]
*  Explosive reporting from Aaron Davis and Carol Lennig at the Washington Post on Friday revealed [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  a years-long criminal investigation into whether Egypt illegally funneled $10 million [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=82.44s)]
*  in cash to Donald Trump for his 2016 campaign. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=89.08s)]
*  Two years into Trump's presidency, federal investigators in the United States had come [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=93.64s)]
*  to know the following things. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=97.56s)]
*  First, classified U.S. intelligence had indicated that Egypt's president at least wanted to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=99.24s)]
*  give Trump $10 million to boost his presidential campaign in 2016. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=105.72s)]
*  Also, in September 2016, just before the election, candidate Trump did have a very [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=111.32s)]
*  chummy meeting with Egypt's president in New York, after which Trump praised him as a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  quote, fantastic guy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=121.96s)]
*  A few weeks after that meeting, just before the election, look at the time on this, October [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=124.52s)]
*  28th, just before the 2016 election, Trump miraculously produced $10 million of his own [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=130.04s)]
*  money to dump into his campaign, which at the time was quite strapped for cash. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=136.76s)]
*  That $10 million infusion, though, wasn't a gift from Trump to his campaign. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=141.56s)]
*  It was structured as a loan so Trump would get the money back. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump, just a few days later, won the election, and then just a few days after that, or a few [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=152.28s)]
*  days before his inauguration, there was that unexplained cash withdrawal of American dollars [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  by the Egyptian intelligence service from a Cairo bank. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=166.36s)]
*  $10 million, the same amount that Egypt's president had reportedly wanted to give Trump, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  according to U.S. intelligence, the same amount that Trump had miraculously found to loan to his [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=175.08s)]
*  own campaign. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=180.44s)]
*  Egypt's president then inexplicably became one of Trump's first guests at the White House as [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  president. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=187.96s)]
*  Trump later released over a billion dollars in military aid for Egypt. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump at one point even called the Egyptian leader, quote, my favorite dictator. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=192.6s)]
*  And for him, there's a lot of competition for that title. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=197.88s)]
*  But U.S. investigators didn't ever prove that the money from Egypt, that cash from that Egyptian [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=201.88s)]
*  bank, went to Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  To prove or disprove that, they would need access to more of Trump's financial records. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=209.72s)]
*  But they would never get that access. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=214.28s)]
*  And that is its own scandal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Carol Lenig and Aaron Davis reporting that Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, stepped in to make [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  sure that FBI agents wouldn't be allowed to subpoena Trump's financial records. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  He also then removed the U.S. attorney who was overseeing the investigation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  And then he removed her replacement as well until he finally got a U.S. attorney in that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  jurisdiction who would shut down the investigation entirely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, what investigators thought might have gone down here, an illegal $10 million [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=243.56s)]
*  cash payment to a presidential campaign from a foreign dictator. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=248.68s)]
*  I mean, if that were ever proven, that would be one of the biggest presidential scandals in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=255.24s)]
*  American history, if not the biggest. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=259.96s)]
*  That said, it hasn't been proven. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=263.72s)]
*  And Donald Trump has denied it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=266.76s)]
*  The reason it hasn't been proven is because nobody was allowed to look at the evidence that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=268.84s)]
*  would prove it or disprove it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=272.28s)]
*  Thank you, Bill Barr. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=273.56s)]
*  Thank you, U.S. Justice Department, for never apparently looking into any of the things that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=274.44s)]
*  Bill Barr did as attorney general to bring grave shame and discredit upon the U.S. Justice [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=278.12s)]
*  Department. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=283.4s)]
*  That's a story for another day. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=284.68s)]
*  I will say, though, Trump is denying the implications of this reporting and this investigation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=288.12s)]
*  He could easily disprove the claims here himself by simply allowing his banks to release his [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=294.92s)]
*  financial records to show that he has nothing to hide because he had nothing to do with this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=301.16s)]
*  In a hard-fought presidential campaign, you might think that would become a political pressure [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=308.6s)]
*  point for Donald Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=312.36s)]
*  I mean, if you're going to tell people they need to release their long-form birth certificates, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=313.24s)]
*  seems like maybe you ought to release your bank records, especially when you're credibly accused [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=317.8s)]
*  of potentially taking a $10 million cash bribe from your favorite dictator. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=323.16s)]
*  Thank you, Bill Barr. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=327.32s)]
*  Joining us now is Washington Post National Investigative Reporter Carol Lenig. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=329.08s)]
*  Carol, thank you so much for being here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=332.28s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=333.64s)]
*  Of course, Rachel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  Did I misconstrue any of that? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=336.36s)]
*  Did I get any of that the wrong way around? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=337.88s)]
*  No. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=340.28s)]
*  You got every part of it right, and especially the chronology. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=340.68s)]
*  I like the way you tell it because it's very clear. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=343.64s)]
*  People who had credible information from the CIA, jaw-dropping intelligence, the CIA was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=347.0s)]
*  warning the Department of Justice, we have an informant and additional corroborating [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=353.64s)]
*  intelligence streams suggesting that Egypt's president wanted to get $10 million to Donald [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=358.2s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=364.68s)]
*  The DOJ began investigating largely under then-Special Counsel, independent Special [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=365.32s)]
*  Counsel Robert Mueller. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=370.68s)]
*  And then when they actually found corroborating evidence of $10 million, walking out the door [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=372.36s)]
*  of a Cairo bank, just as the intelligence foretold through the account of the Egyptian [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=378.52s)]
*  spy agency, the General Intelligence Agency, when they found that incredibly and compelling [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=385.0s)]
*  evidence, they were barred from trying to figure out whether any of that money ended [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  up in any of Donald Trump's personal or business accounts. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=395.56s)]
*  What would the scope be? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=403.0s)]
*  How big a proverbial subpoena would it need to be in order for investigators to get the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=405.48s)]
*  kinds of records that would prove or disprove these implications? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=413.24s)]
*  The subpoena that was drafted and proposed in April of 2019 by the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  in D.C. and again proposed in June of 2019 and again proposed in the fall of 2019 was [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=426.04s)]
*  fairly limited. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=434.28s)]
*  It basically asked for records around the time of this bizarre cash withdrawal in Egypt, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=435.4s)]
*  January 15, 2017, a few weeks before and several weeks after. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=442.11999999999995s)]
*  It was not a very broad amount of time. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=447.08s)]
*  It was scoped down and careful, but they could not get the U.S. Attorney's approval for that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=449.55999999999995s)]
*  After she met with Attorney General Bill Barr, she decided that they didn't have the factual [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=456.52s)]
*  basis or the predicate to seek the records of the sitting president. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=463.08s)]
*  And just so you know, Rachel, if you walked into the FBI field office today and said you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=467.32s)]
*  believed you had information about me laundering money or taking money illegally, the FBI could [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=472.68s)]
*  get a subpoena for my bank records in about 10 minutes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=478.68s)]
*  It wouldn't take very long. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=482.52s)]
*  In this case, this group was blocked for two years from gathering any evidence. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  Carol, what would you and just your reporters take on this from what you understand and the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=489.56s)]
*  sources that you spoke with? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=495.64s)]
*  How would you describe the confidence level of the investigators who thought that this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  $10 million might have gone from Egypt to Donald Trump? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the Trump appointees of the Justice Department who ultimately shut this thing [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=505.64s)]
*  down and didn't let them investigate it, they sort of made it seem like these folks were [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=509.08s)]
*  looking for evidence for some cockamamie theory. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=515.88s)]
*  But the people who spoke to you who were involved in the investigation, how did they [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=519.24s)]
*  characterize their level of confidence or suspicion that something really was truly [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=522.44s)]
*  wrong here? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=528.7600000000001s)]
*  The sources we spoke to who were very close to the probe described a group of agents, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=530.84s)]
*  FBI agents and prosecutors who were gobsmacked that they had found this level of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=537.24s)]
*  information. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=544.68s)]
*  First, the intelligence was pretty stunning and came from a reliable source who had provided [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  reliable information in the past in this field. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=552.76s)]
*  Then they had a document that proved a movement of $10 million from exactly the intelligence [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  agency that was suspected in the intelligence to have been the source of the funds in the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  exact dollar figure. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=570.28s)]
*  Then they had Donald Trump basically flipping the switch on all of this U.S. policy on Egypt [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=571.88s)]
*  in a way that was extremely beneficial to the president of Egypt. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  The first meeting that was ever held with the new U.S. president was with the Egyptian [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  president. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  A pretty big kiss, if you will, to that country that we had held at arm's length. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=588.76s)]
*  These investigators and agents were described to us as stunned because they had never gathered [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=594.76s)]
*  this quality of investigation in a money laundering or financial conspiracy case before. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=600.84s)]
*  Certainly not one that had been closed down and not one in which they'd been barred from [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  continuing to investigate the leads right in front of their faces. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=613.24s)]
*  Stunned and gobsmacked. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=617.88s)]
*  Again, there is an easy way to sort this out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=619.96s)]
*  Those financial records don't have to be subpoenaed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=623.24s)]
*  A candidate who wanted to dispel these sorts of allegations and said they were not true [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=625.32s)]
*  could simply release that information publicly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=629.24s)]
*  But we will await that development. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=631.8s)]
*  Washington Post National Investigative Reporter Carol Lenning, thank you for the reporting. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=634.92s)]
*  Thank you for helping us understand it, Carol. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=638.36s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFMrygQa8U8&t=639.88s)]
