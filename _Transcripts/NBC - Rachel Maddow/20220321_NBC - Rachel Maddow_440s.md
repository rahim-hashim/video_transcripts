# Putin's Brutality Incurs The Hatred Of Formerly Pro-Russian Ukrainians: Engel
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM)
*  Joining us now live from Keefe is NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=0.0s)]
*  Richard, thanks for your excellent report and the excellent reporting that you continue [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=4.64s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=7.82s)]
*  I do want to get a sense you're on the ground. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=8.82s)]
*  You're seeing how some of these fights and resistance are going on the ground. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=11.38s)]
*  And you also have access to this high-level evaluation that there's a stalemate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=16.72s)]
*  Tell me how you evaluate that statement against what you're seeing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=22.34s)]
*  So right now we're seeing two kinds of resistance. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=28.92s)]
*  We're seeing military resistance, which is so far keeping Russian forces from Keefe. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=32.86s)]
*  Russian forces have been kept back to the northern suburbs of the city and they have [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=39.32s)]
*  not been able to advance in days. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=44.78s)]
*  So we're seeing conventional military resistance. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=46.88s)]
*  And we're also seeing civil disobedience. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=49.86s)]
*  We're seeing that in Kherson. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=52.2s)]
*  And Kherson is one of the only places where Russians actually occupy the city. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  They patrol. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=61.04s)]
*  They patrol on foot. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=62.04s)]
*  They've imposed a kind of shadow government. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  But people are not accepting it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=67.2s)]
*  And Kherson was considered one of the more pro-Russian communities here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=69.42s)]
*  Before this war began, and I think this was one of the things that Vladimir Putin was [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  counting on, there were deep divides here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=77.34s)]
*  There were divides between East and West. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  There were divides between those who spoke Russian and those who speak native Ukrainian. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=81.92s)]
*  And Kherson was considered the closest to Russia, as was Mariupol. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=87.68s)]
*  But if you look at what's happening in Mariupol and if you look at what is happening in Kherson [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=94.12s)]
*  right now, there's real hatred for Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=97.8s)]
*  People are swearing blood oaths. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=101.44s)]
*  They are leaving the city if they can. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=104.14s)]
*  They're being strip searched when they're leaving Mariupol as the guards check to see [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=106.44s)]
*  if they have some sort of Nazi insignia tattooed, swastikas tattooed on their body. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=111.72s)]
*  And in Kherson, they're standing up to gunfire. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=117.84s)]
*  So the Russian plan, both from a hearts and minds campaign, if you will, plan to occupy [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  and easily pacify areas that were thought to be pro-Russia, that's not working. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=128.18s)]
*  And its conventional military plan to drive into the cities is not working for now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=133.08s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit more about Mariupol. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=139.5s)]
*  At this point, there's been an offer or request by Russia that Ukraine simply cede Mariupol. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  The Ukrainians have rejected that offer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=147.44s)]
*  But the idea that maybe Vladimir Putin is giving up on the idea of taking Kiev and the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=149.82000000000002s)]
*  government and instead would be satisfied by more territorial gains, explain that to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  Give me some context around that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=162.32s)]
*  So throughout this conflict, we've been guessing about Vladimir Putin's intentions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  And unfortunately, we've often been guessing them incorrectly. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=171.64s)]
*  There was a camp that thought that Vladimir Putin wouldn't invade. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=175.32s)]
*  And that camp included the Ukrainian government and included President Zelensky, by the way, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=178.28s)]
*  who thought right until the end that Russia wasn't going to launch a full scale invasion. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=182.32s)]
*  Then there was a camp that maybe Putin would take a piece, that he would just take the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=187.88s)]
*  Donbass or maybe he would take a land bridge to Crimea. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=192.64s)]
*  Now if he wants a land bridge to Crimea, that would be able to connect the territory of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Russia to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed after it took it over in 2014. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=202.38s)]
*  Then he would have to take the city of Mariupol and Herson and a few other areas in that southern [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=209.72s)]
*  region along the Black Coast and the Sea of Azov. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=216.06s)]
*  From Putin's perspective, that would give him a win. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=219.78s)]
*  It would allow him to secure Crimea and secure the water supply to Crimea, which also flows [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=223.16s)]
*  through that area. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=229.62s)]
*  But is that going to be enough? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=231.54s)]
*  And if people misjudged Putin the first time, I think we would be foolish to allow ourselves [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=233.54s)]
*  to be fooled twice and assume that he would just be satisfied with a slice in the east, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  especially when his troops are continuing to dig in. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  There's new satellite images showing that the troops are still mobilizing around the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=251.28s)]
*  borders of this country, particularly up in the north of Belarus. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=255.84s)]
*  So it is not at all clear that he wants to only take Mariupol and would somehow be satisfied [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=259.48s)]
*  with that and walk away. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=265.74s)]
*  I think those calculations, we were having those calculations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=267.88s)]
*  One of the other things. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=270.08s)]
*  In the beginning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=271.08s)]
*  But now that he is in this war, it's not clear. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=272.08s)]
*  So let's talk about, at the beginning there was also a calculation and potentially not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=276.56s)]
*  officially, but we heard there may have been an offer or a plan by the U.S. to get Vladimir [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=281.08s)]
*  Zelensky out of Kiev, either to western Ukraine, a place like Lviv or somewhere else that might [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  have been safer, or even to Poland to have a government in exile. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=291.64s)]
*  He refused to leave Kiev, as did his members of parliament and government officials, and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=296.44s)]
*  Kiev still stands and they are still in Kiev and you are still in Kiev. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=300.84s)]
*  We do know that there continue to be assaults on that city. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=305.0s)]
*  There was a deadly assault overnight at a shopping mall. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=307.36s)]
*  What is the situation on the ground where you are in Kiev? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=310.44s)]
*  So there was also a big intelligence failure that I think we should acknowledge. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=316.32s)]
*  The U.S. correctly predicted that Vladimir Putin would do some sort of invasion, but [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=321.8s)]
*  the intelligence failure was that they thought the Ukrainian government was going to imminently [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=328.64s)]
*  collapse and that Zelensky would have to become some Charles de Gaulle figure operating in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=332.76s)]
*  exile when now he is still here and he's leading an effective resistance. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=337.36s)]
*  You asked about the mood here in Kiev. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=343.48s)]
*  It is a very strange city right now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=345.76s)]
*  There are two million people here according to the mayor, give or take. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=348.68s)]
*  Most of them are men because men are not allowed to leave this country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  If you notice where you are, the lots of the refugees, it's women, children and the elderly. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=356.36s)]
*  The men are still here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=362.24s)]
*  There's no real work, so to speak. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=364.88s)]
*  Nothing is open. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=367.32s)]
*  There's not the ability to shop. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=368.96s)]
*  So you have lots of men in their houses with no families living presumably on crackers [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=371.0s)]
*  and salami. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no alcohol in the city. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=377.16s)]
*  The whole city has been declared dry by the mayor. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=378.68s)]
*  Everyone is participating in some form in civil defense. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=381.88000000000005s)]
*  People walk around in sort of militarized clothing with colored armbands around their [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=387.56s)]
*  upper arm, either yellow or blue, to show that they're loyal to the army. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=394.8s)]
*  There's checkpoints on the streets. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  You're asked for your papers every time you go through a checkpoint or often when you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=401.88s)]
*  go through a checkpoint. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=405.96s)]
*  It is a it harkens back to an earlier time when you are asked to see your papers every [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=408.2s)]
*  place you go in a city full of men bracing for war. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU19rmNsNiM&t=414.91999999999996s)]
