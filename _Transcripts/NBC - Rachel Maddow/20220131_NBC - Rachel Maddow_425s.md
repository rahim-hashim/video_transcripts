# 'A Pernicious Threat': Trump Incitement Of Mob Triggers Security, Safety Concerns
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4)
*  District Attorney Willis has convened a special grant or is convening a special grand jury to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=0.0s)]
*  consider the particulars of that case. And she has now called for backup in terms of her security. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=5.44s)]
*  She's written a letter to the special agents in charge of the FBI, the FBI's Atlanta field office, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=11.84s)]
*  because of new concerns for the safety, not just of her team and the prosecutor's office, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=17.84s)]
*  but of everybody that's even just physically close to her investigation. The letter says in part, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=22.16s)]
*  I have an obligation to ensure that those who work in and visit the Fulton County Courthouse, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  the adjoining Fulton County Government Center and the surrounding areas are safe. In close proximity [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=33.44s)]
*  to the courthouse are the Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta City Hall, federal courthouses and Georgia [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=38.64s)]
*  State University, including student dormitories. Security concerns were escalated this weekend [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=43.2s)]
*  by the rhetoric of former President Trump at a public event in Conroe, Texas. Specifically, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  President Trump said, quote, If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=53.28s)]
*  illegal, I hope we're going to have in this country the biggest protests we've ever had [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=59.44s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere, because our country and our elections [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=63.84s)]
*  are corrupt. Willis continues in her letter, quote, This rhetoric is more alarming in light [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  of his statements at the same event regarding those convicted of crimes, including violence [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=75.2s)]
*  for actions at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021. He stated that if elected president in 2024, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=79.12s)]
*  he may pardon people who've been convicted of crimes related to the illegal acts at the U.S. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=84.56s)]
*  Capitol that day. And then she makes this very direct ask of the FBI, quote, I am asking that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=89.76s)]
*  you immediately conduct a risk assessment of the Fulton County Courthouse and Government Center [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=95.12s)]
*  and that you provide protective resources to include intelligence and federal agents. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=100.4s)]
*  Quote, It is imperative that these resources are in place well in advance of the convening of the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  special purpose grand jury on May 2nd, 2022. So this is the district attorney of Fulton County, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=110.08s)]
*  Georgia, who has opened an investigation into whether state laws were broken when the president [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=118.72s)]
*  pressured state officials in Georgia to try to overturn, falsify the election results in that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=123.36s)]
*  state. This is her asking the FBI for assistance, including federal agents to protect her and her [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=127.44s)]
*  staff during their investigation of President Trump. That's where we are. And that is a heck [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=133.68s)]
*  of a picture of where our democracy is at and where the de facto leader of the Republican party [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=141.6s)]
*  is leading the country. But here's a practical question. What can the FBI actually do here? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  Are they the right agency to ask for help? And what are they likely to do in response? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=152.24s)]
*  Joining us now is my friend Chuck Rosenberg. He is a former senior Justice Department official and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=157.28s)]
*  former senior FBI official. He knows these things. Chuck, it's great to see you. Thank [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=161.2s)]
*  you for being here tonight. It's my pleasure, Rachel. Is this letter addressed to the right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=165.04s)]
*  entity? Is the FBI the right agency to assess this kind of perceived threat from the DA's office and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=172.72s)]
*  potentially to provide help? Partly no, and mostly yes. So let me explain that. The FBI isn't in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  business of securing courthouses or other facilities. They don't harden buildings. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=187.68s)]
*  It's not their expertise. And I assume District Attorney Willis knows that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=193.12s)]
*  There's another interesting fact, Rachel, which is that this letter was public. I imagine the press [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  may have received it before the FBI did. And in all my time in government, if I needed something [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=203.28s)]
*  from another U.S. attorney elsewhere in the country or a chief or a sheriff in my jurisdiction, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=208.32s)]
*  I would never write a letter. I would pick up the phone and call, and I would expect them to call me. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=214.56s)]
*  But she wrote a letter, so she very clearly wanted to make it public that she was asking for help. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=219.36s)]
*  Let me tell you the mostly yes answer to the question. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=224.56s)]
*  Throughout the country, including in Atlanta, the FBI leads joint terrorism task forces. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=228.56s)]
*  Sitting on these JTTFs, including in Atlanta, I suspect, are the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=234.72s)]
*  the Atlanta PD, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, and all of their state and local partners. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=240.8s)]
*  Together, as part of a JTTF, they can certainly provide to the district attorney what she needs. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  They can advise her about hardening the facility or securing the courthouse. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  They can give her intel from their own holdings. They can search their own holdings. They can query [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=257.36s)]
*  or task their informants. And so it's a very good, thoughtful, public way for the district attorney [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=262.88s)]
*  to say, I think I need help. And Chuck, I was struck in the way that she phrased the request. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=269.36s)]
*  She explicitly mentions President Trump promising pardons to people convicted even of violent events [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=278.0s)]
*  around the January 6th attack on the Capitol. She's connecting the threat [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  posed by Trump calling for his supporters to get in the streets if there is an indictment, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=293.76s)]
*  essentially, and casting the aspersions that he cast on all the various prosecutors that are [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=298.72s)]
*  looking at him. She's drawing a connection between that threat and the fact that he's promising [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  pardons for people who have committed violent acts on his behalf in the past. I wondered if you could [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=308.24s)]
*  just, with your law enforcement and your FBI experience, your Justice Department experience, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=313.12s)]
*  if you could talk about that nexus, whether that's a fair connection for her to draw [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=317.36s)]
*  and whether that does affect the nature of the threat. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  It is a fair connection for her to draw, and it does affect the nature of the threat. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  And, Rachel, here's why. A defendant, somebody charged with a crime, makes a series of calculations. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=330.0s)]
*  Should I go to trial? Should I plead guilty? If I plead guilty, should I cooperate? They are all [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=337.76s)]
*  looking to minimize their exposure, to mitigate the risk, to undo the harm. And so many defendants, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=342.88s)]
*  most, plead guilty, and many defendants, most, try to cooperate. But if the president of the United [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=350.08s)]
*  States, former, perhaps again, tells you, I got your back, I'm dangling pardons. In fact, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=356.24s)]
*  I've given them out to people who have kept their mouth shut in the past. If a would-be president [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=364.88s)]
*  of the United States dangles a pardon, maybe it changes the calculation of a defendant who would [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=370.4s)]
*  otherwise cooperate. Maybe it changes the behavior of a supporter in the street who might not [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=377.28s)]
*  otherwise commit a crime. So I think this is a pernicious threat. This is a dangerous thing to do, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  not just because it changes the calculations of people who have already been charged with a crime. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=390.08s)]
*  It changes the calculations of people who may not yet have committed a crime. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  Exactly. This pernicious is exactly the right word. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce3saV6P3f4&t=400.0s)]
