# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 12
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU)
*  True to form, though, Republican Congressman Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska just this week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=0.0s)]
*  announced that he, too, is going to run for re-election, even while he is under federal [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=4.34s)]
*  indictment and awaiting trial on multiple felony counts. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=9.08s)]
*  You know, hey, it worked for Congressman Chris Collins and Congressman Duncan Hunter. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=12.6s)]
*  Republican voters re-elected them while they were awaiting trial, too. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=18.0s)]
*  Why not Jeff Fortenberry? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=22.2s)]
*  That said, Donald Trump is no longer president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=25.48s)]
*  So the end game here is less certain. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=28.96s)]
*  After Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins were convicted and sentenced to long federal prison [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=32.52s)]
*  terms, then President Donald Trump pardoned each of them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=36.56s)]
*  If Republican Congressman Jeff Fortenberry is also convicted, like Collins and Hunter [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=41.44s)]
*  were, Jeff Fortenberry will have no such ace in the hole. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=46.16s)]
*  There is no Donald Trump there now to pardon him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  So if Fortenberry is convicted, Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy gets to look forward [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  to the, you know, the awkward dance of this serving Republican member of Congress prepping [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=58.06s)]
*  for his prison term and, you know, having to make him resign and all of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=62.5s)]
*  It's become almost a regular part of Kevin McCarthy's job by now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=67.78s)]
*  Three times in just the last five years this has happened to him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=71.94s)]
*  And now, again, it looks like it might be happening to him again, which, I mean, honestly, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  this is like getting hit by lightning while you're winning the lottery on a blue moon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=83.38s)]
*  on your birthday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=87.64s)]
*  Like, this is just not normal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=88.64s)]
*  But this is Kevin McCarthy's life. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=90.24s)]
*  The great Florida political reporter Mark Caputo works for NBC News now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=92.6s)]
*  Quite a coup for NBC to have landed him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  There really is nobody like Mark Caputo in Florida political journalism today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=98.36s)]
*  And today Mr. Caputo is the sole byline on this scoop from NBC News. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=102.52s)]
*  Although I should mention the legendary NBC justice correspondent Pete Williams contributed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  reporting to this as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=110.96s)]
*  The state line Orlando, Florida, quote, Congressman Matt Gaetz's ex-girlfriend testified today [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=112.56s)]
*  before a federal grand jury investigating him for sex crimes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  A major development that suggests the U.S. Department of Justice may be moving closer [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=122.2s)]
*  to indicting Congressman Gaetz. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=126.76s)]
*  The ex-girlfriend, whose name is being withheld by NBC News to respect her privacy, has been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  in talks for months with prosecutors about an immunity deal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Under a possible deal, she would avoid prosecution for obstruction of justice and return for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=137.2s)]
*  testifying in the investigation into whether Gaetz in 2017 had sex with a 17 year old female [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=141.3s)]
*  for money and whether months later he and others violated a federal law prohibiting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=147.9s)]
*  people from transporting others across state lines to engage in prostitution. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=152.9s)]
*  Gaetz has not been charged with the crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=158.34s)]
*  He has denied all accusations. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  The attorney for Gaetz's ex-girlfriend, Tim Janssen, declined comment about the case Wednesday [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=162.02s)]
*  when he was spotted by an NBC News reporter entering the federal courthouse in Orlando [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=166.9s)]
*  with his client. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=171.26s)]
*  A Department of Justice spokesman declined comment. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=172.26s)]
*  Gaetz did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=175.5s)]
*  But legal sources familiar with the case say Congressman Gaetz is being investigated for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=179.5s)]
*  three distinct crimes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=184.02s)]
*  Sex trafficking a minor, violating the MAN Act, which prohibits taking women across state [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=186.7s)]
*  lines for prostitution, and obstructing justice. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=191.98s)]
*  I imagine that was a dyspeptic moment for Republican leader Kevin McCarthy today, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  You can just imagine, like, oh, it would be a fly on the wall at the next Republican caucus [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=203.22s)]
*  meeting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=206.82s)]
*  Can you guys please stop with the criming? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=207.82s)]
*  Just for a little while, just for a hot minute, Trump is not here to keep you all out of prison [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  anymore. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=216.22s)]
*  Enough with the felonies, you guys. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=217.22s)]
*  Hit pause. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=219.22s)]
*  Leave me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=220.62s)]
*  So the day was already not going great for the House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=227.62s)]
*  But then at four o'clock this afternoon, it got worse when the January 6th investigation [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=229.1s)]
*  posted this letter to Kevin McCarthy himself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=234.62s)]
*  It is a letter inviting him to please provide information to the investigation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=237.74s)]
*  Quote, Dear Leader McCarthy, we write to request your voluntary cooperation with our investigation [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=241.66s)]
*  on a range of critical topics, including your conversations with President Trump before, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=247.82s)]
*  during, and after the violent January 6th attack. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=252.22s)]
*  You have acknowledged speaking directly with the former president while the violence was [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=255.54s)]
*  underway on January 6th. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=258.94s)]
*  This information bears directly on President Trump's state of mind during the January 6th [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=261.1s)]
*  attack as the violence was underway. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  The select committee is aware that notwithstanding the unacceptable violence that day, you nevertheless [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=267.14s)]
*  agreed to support continued objections to the electoral votes from multiple states. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=272.42s)]
*  Late in the evening of January 6th and into the morning of January 7th, the select committee [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=277.22s)]
*  wishes to question you regarding communications you may have had with President Trump, President [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=281.74s)]
*  Trump's legal team, Representative Jim Jordan, and others at the time on that topic. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan, really. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=294.18s)]
*  Quote, It appears that you may also have discussed with President Trump the potential that he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  would face a censure resolution, impeachment, or removal from office under the 25th Amendment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=300.70000000000005s)]
*  It also appears that you may have identified other possible options for President Trump, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=306.78s)]
*  including his immediate resignation from office. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=310.9s)]
*  Relatedly, the select committee is concerned about the potential for continued violence [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=314.61999999999995s)]
*  after January 6th, provoked by President Trump's false claims that the election was stolen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  The committee is aware of communications among White House staff and President Trump's supporters [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  regarding the potential for further violence. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=328.14s)]
*  For example, and this is new today, Fox News host Laura Ingraham texted White House Chief [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=330.61999999999995s)]
*  of Staff Mark Meadows on January 12th, 2021. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=336.14s)]
*  Quote, remarks on camera discouraging protest at state capitals, especially with weapons, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=339.58s)]
*  will be well advised given how hot the situation is. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=345.98s)]
*  Again, that text reportedly from a Fox News host to the White House Chief of Staff. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=349.62s)]
*  The committee continues, quote, during this same time period, you shared this concern [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=354.98s)]
*  about the president's stolen election claims with your local news organization, saying, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=359.26s)]
*  quote, it's raising the ability for greater violence. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=363.94s)]
*  The letter then goes on to ask Congressman Kevin McCarthy to meet with the investigators [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=369.38s)]
*  the first week of February. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  They also quote back to him a statement he made to a local news station in California [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=375.26s)]
*  just a couple of weeks ago indicating in response to a question that he would speak to the investigation. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=379.54s)]
*  He told that local news source, quote, I have been very public. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=384.7s)]
*  I wouldn't hide from anything. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=387.62s)]
*  And said just tonight, literally just in the past few minutes, it has been handed to me [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=390.7s)]
*  since I started this segment. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=394.94s)]
*  It has just come out. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy has just put out this statement saying that he will not cooperate with the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=398.62s)]
*  January 6th investigation. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=403.34s)]
*  He says in part, quote, as a representative and the leader of the minority party, it is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  with neither regret nor satisfaction that I have concluded to not participate with this [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=410.46s)]
*  select committee's abusive power that stains this institution today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=416.54s)]
*  So we shall see. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  The lead of the January 6th investigation, Chairman Benny Thompson, said today that he [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=425.26000000000005s)]
*  actually expects that Kevin McCarthy will agree to provide information. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  He said that they don't anticipate even having to subpoena him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=436.26s)]
*  Now Kevin McCarthy has come out and said that he is not going to cooperate. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  We shall see how this resolves. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=446.46s)]
*  The question of whether or not members of Congress, let alone leaders in Congress, can [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=447.46s)]
*  be subpoenaed by this committee appears to be settled as a constitutional matter. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=450.94s)]
*  It appears to be uncontroversial as a black letter matter in terms of constitutional law. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=454.98s)]
*  The problem is that it's never been done before and any time a new precedent like that is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=460.38s)]
*  set, a lot of people are reluctant to go there and nobody quite knows how the fight over [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=464.54s)]
*  it will happen. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=467.9s)]
*  By the end of this week, it will be a month exactly since Congress sent to the U.S. Justice [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=470.06s)]
*  Department a criminal referral recommending federal prosecution of Trump's White House [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=474.74s)]
*  Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=479.38s)]
*  They are recommending that he be prosecuted for criminal contempt for his refusal to comply [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=482.74s)]
*  with compulsory measures, including the subpoenas that he's received from the January 6th investigation. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  Now the January 6th investigation and then the full House recommended prosecution for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=492.62s)]
*  the same reason for Steve Bannon, Trump advisor Steve Bannon, when he defied subpoenas to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=498.38s)]
*  testify. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=504.42s)]
*  Now in the Bannon case, it took the U.S. Justice Department just three weeks after they got [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=505.42s)]
*  the referral for him to actually decide that they were going to prosecute him and to obtain [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=509.38s)]
*  the indictment that they obtained against him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=513.86s)]
*  It took three weeks with Bannon. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=515.86s)]
*  It's been longer than that already for Meadows. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=518.02s)]
*  It's been longer than that already that the U.S. Justice Department, the federal prosecutor's [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=521.54s)]
*  office in D.C. has been considering this referral to prosecute Trump's White House Chief of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=524.7s)]
*  Staff for the same thing. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  Again, it'll be a month even by the end of this week, but so far we've heard nothing [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=531.3s)]
*  about what the Justice Department's going to do. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=536.54s)]
*  And the reason I say that is increasingly on my mind is because for the last few days [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=538.9399999999999s)]
*  here we have been reporting on emerging evidence that in not one, not two, not three, not four, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  but five, in at least five different states, Republicans appear to have forged fake documents. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=552.9s)]
*  Proporting to be the electoral slates from these five states, they put themselves forward [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=561.06s)]
*  officially as if they were the real duly elected electors to the electoral college from their [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  states when they in fact were not. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=571.26s)]
*  In each of these five states, it was Joe Biden who won the election, so those states sent [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=573.6199999999999s)]
*  Biden electors to cast the state's votes in the electoral college. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  But nevertheless, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona, at least, Republicans [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=580.9s)]
*  filed fake documents claiming that those states had actually picked Trump electors who were [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=587.7800000000001s)]
*  going to cast the state's electoral college votes for Trump. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=592.9000000000001s)]
*  In the last few days here, thanks to reporting from Nicholas Wu at Politico.com and thanks [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=597.7800000000001s)]
*  to public records requests filed by the Watchdog Group American Oversight, we have been able [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=601.62s)]
*  to obtain and show you all five of those forged documents from Republicans in those five states. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=605.74s)]
*  Crucially, what we've noticed is that this doesn't seem to have been an instance in which [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=611.98s)]
*  five disparate groups of people in five different states all had the same forgery idea coincidentally [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=616.9s)]
*  at the same time, and they just independently all happened to do the same thing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=622.22s)]
*  If you actually look at the false documents that these five states or that Republicans [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=625.86s)]
*  in these five states sent into Congress and sent into the National Archives, the documents [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=630.3000000000001s)]
*  match each other exactly. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=634.86s)]
*  Same font, same spacing, same exact wording. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=637.1800000000001s)]
*  Because of that, I mean, maybe it all proved to be a coincidence, but it does appear to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=643.22s)]
*  have been a coordinated effort. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=647.46s)]
*  At the very least, it appears that somebody distributed a template to Republicans in these [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=648.86s)]
*  five states and potentially beyond, telling them that this is how they should create these [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=654.26s)]
*  forged documents. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=658.96s)]
*  The whole reason we're on to any of this is because it appears that this is something [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=663.36s)]
*  that the January 6th investigation is looking into. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=667.76s)]
*  We're sort of reverse engineering one of their lines of inquiry as best we can. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=670.62s)]
*  But as such, look at the Mark Meadows connection. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=676.38s)]
*  I mean, what I'm about to show you, this doesn't say that the effort to coordinate these forgeries [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=681.62s)]
*  in five states came from the Trump White House. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=687.4s)]
*  But if you look at the contempt report that the January 6th investigation created about [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=690.42s)]
*  It does seem to indicate that when he was serving as White House Chief of Staff, he [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=696.8s)]
*  was somehow involved in this. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=700.88s)]
*  This is from the contempt referral on Mark Meadows. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=703.64s)]
*  Quote, the select committee seeks information from Mr. Meadows about issues including the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  following. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=710.0799999999999s)]
*  Quote, Mr. Meadows received text messages and emails regarding apparent efforts to encourage [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  Republican legislators in certain states to send alternate slates of electors to Congress. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=716.04s)]
*  A plan which one member of Congress acknowledged was, quote, highly controversial and to which [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=723.64s)]
*  Mr. Meadows responded, quote, I love it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=728.14s)]
*  Mr. Meadows responded to a similar message by saying, we are, and another such message [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=731.68s)]
*  by saying, quote, yes, have a team on it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  This is also from the letter the January 6th investigation sent to Mark Meadows' lawyer [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=741.84s)]
*  about a month ago now when they were fighting with him about his cooperation just before [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=747.12s)]
*  he was referred for prosecution to the Justice Department. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  That letter told Mr. Meadows' lawyer this, quote, Mr. Meadows has also produced documents [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=753.88s)]
*  you apparently agree are relevant and not protected by any privilege at all. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=758.0s)]
*  Those documents include a November 7th, 2020 email discussing the appointment of alternate [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=762.16s)]
*  slates of electors as part of a, quote, direct and collateral attack after the election. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=768.8s)]
*  So again, we have learned recently that one of the things these guys did to try to falsify [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=779.6s)]
*  the election results and keep Trump in power and prevent the newly elected president from [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=785.08s)]
*  assuming office, one of the things they did was that they got Republicans in multiple [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=789.48s)]
*  states to create and file forged paperwork pretending to be the real electors from states [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=794.44s)]
*  that actually Biden won. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=801.84s)]
*  We believe now that we've seen the documents from five of the states and they all match [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=804.28s)]
*  almost exactly. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=807.76s)]
*  We surmise based on that that this must have been some kind of a coordinated effort, that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=808.76s)]
*  somebody gave all these Republicans and all these states a template for how to do it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=813.4s)]
*  In so doing, incidentally, all those Republicans and all those states who signed their names [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=817.52s)]
*  to these forged documents, they may have opened themselves individually to potential forgery [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=822.56s)]
*  charges or other charges related to falsifying election-related documents, which is a state [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  crime in every state in the union and is a federal crime as well. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  We know from the January 6 investigation that Trump's White House chief of staff, Mark [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=837.6s)]
*  Meadows, was apparently involved in multiple communications about such an effort, that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=841.44s)]
*  he said he had a team on it, that we're doing it, that he loved it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=846.88s)]
*  And we know that the Justice Department is currently weighing the possibility of a criminal [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=853.12s)]
*  prosecution against him, in part over his refusal to talk about exactly that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=856.3000000000001s)]
*  Other than that, how was your day? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=864.0s)]
*  So this is interesting. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=868.32s)]
*  We've got late breaking news today out of the great state of Arizona, which never disappoints [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=869.32s)]
*  in news terms. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=873.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=874.6s)]
*  I was speaking earlier in the show tonight about a story that we've been on for a while [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=875.6s)]
*  now. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=878.2s)]
*  The story of Republicans appearing to have forged fake documents after the 2020 election, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=879.2s)]
*  putting themselves forward officially as if they were the real electors from their states, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=884.84s)]
*  when in fact they were not. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=889.76s)]
*  In each of the five states that we've been able to find the documents from in Michigan, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=891.44s)]
*  Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, Republicans filed these fake forged documents, claiming that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=896.8s)]
*  those states had actually picked Trump electors who were casting the state's electoral college [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=902.6s)]
*  votes for Trump, when in fact the real electors from those states were Biden electors. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  Republicans forged these documents. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  They submitted them, we believe, both to Congress and to the National Archives to try to pass [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  them off as the real deal. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=917.52s)]
*  We've been trying to get a hold of some of these people who signed their names to these [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=919.56s)]
*  forged documents to learn more about this apparent coordinated scheme, particularly since we noticed [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=923.08s)]
*  that all of the forgeries from those five states appear to be very similar, similar [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=927.84s)]
*  enough that it looks like they were part of a coordinated multi-state effort. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=931.64s)]
*  We're still working on our part of that, but tonight, NBC's Great Station in Phoenix and [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=935.96s)]
*  a reporter from the Arizona Republic caught up with one of the people who signed onto [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  this document in Arizona. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=944.12s)]
*  His name is Jake Hoffman. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=945.84s)]
*  He's a Republican state representative in Arizona. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=947.28s)]
*  You can see here that's his kind of amazing signature on the forged fake elector form [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=949.96s)]
*  from Arizona. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=955.0s)]
*  A cameraman from KPNX and an Arizona Republic reporter named Richard Ruales caught up with [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=956.52s)]
*  Mr. Hoffman today, and this is what happened. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=963.0s)]
*  When Bram wants to ask a real question, happy to have a conversation with him. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=969.24s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=973.32s)]
*  So, in unprecedented times, unprecedented action has occurred. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=979.88s)]
*  There is no case law. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=991.52s)]
*  There is no precedent that exists as to whether or not an election that is currently being [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=992.52s)]
*  litigated in the courts has due standing, which is why we felt it appropriate to provide [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=998.64s)]
*  Congress and the Vice President with dueling opinions. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1004.08s)]
*  Did you have direction from anybody in doing this? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1008.96s)]
*  Was it you, 11, yourself doing this, or did someone give you advice on the manner in which [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  you can do it? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1017.3199999999999s)]
*  So I'm simply, I was one of the electors, right? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1019.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm not in charge of the electors, so you would need to ask the party chair that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1022.24s)]
*  How did you hear about it? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1024.0s)]
*  How did you hear about the plan? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1025.0s)]
*  Were you just told to be someone? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1026.0s)]
*  You would need to ask the party chair that. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1030.4s)]
*  But you're the person who received the call. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1031.6399999999999s)]
*  You showed up, right? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  How did you know to show up that day? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1035.12s)]
*  So as I said, you can go ahead and ask the party chair the logistics of it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1036.84s)]
*  Ask her how you got a phone call to go somewhere? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1040.6s)]
*  You're welcome to talk to them about the logistics. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1042.48s)]
*  Do you not know how you arrived at a place? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1043.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1045.9599999999998s)]
*  I appreciate your question. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1046.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you really not know how you got a call? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1047.9599999999998s)]
*  Have a great one. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1048.9599999999998s)]
*  The other question, I was hoping. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1049.9599999999998s)]
*  We got help. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfWbwan3ZOU&t=1050.9599999999998s)]
