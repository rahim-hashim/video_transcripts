# Maddow: History's judgment looms as citizen Trump faces accountability
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c)
*  He is, of course, innocent until proven guilty, and he will and should mount a robust defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=0.0s)]
*  against these charges. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=7.88s)]
*  And he should be acquitted if he didn't do what he is accused of. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=10.08s)]
*  But if the allegations made by the Justice Department in this indictment are proven, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=14.84s)]
*  if the former president did what he is accused of, history is going to ask a different question [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  than what we might have otherwise been expecting. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=26.92s)]
*  If the allegations in this indictment are proven beyond a reasonable doubt and a jury [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=31.0s)]
*  convicts him of these crimes, history is not going to ask, wow, how did America get to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=34.64s)]
*  the point where they indicted a former president? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=39.88s)]
*  History instead is going to ask, how did America get to the point where such a person could [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=43.86s)]
*  be elected to the presidency of the United States, where actions such as these could [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=48.52s)]
*  be carried out from the Oval Office, directed by a person who was elected president by the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=54.2s)]
*  American people along with his advisors? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=59.68s)]
*  This is a grave day and a serious one for our country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=64.42s)]
*  Thank you for being with us here tonight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=68.16s)]
*  We know you have every choice in the world, but we're happy to have you here on what will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=71.0s)]
*  go down in U.S. history as a black letter, bold-faced date. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=74.84s)]
*  August 1st, 2023 is the date on which a former president and the leading presidential candidate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=78.96s)]
*  of the Republican Party was indicted in federal court accused of leading multiple criminal [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=85.44s)]
*  conspiracies to try to hold power by force after he was voted out of office by the people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=90.08s)]
*  Whatever satisfaction there may be in seeing the country demonstrate rather than just say [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=98.24s)]
*  that we're a nation of laws, that the laws apply to everyone in this country, no matter [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  how powerful, whatever the sort of civic satisfaction is in seeing our country tested on that point [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=108.6s)]
*  and rising to the occasion when it needed to happen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  I think everyone will now need to concede that things are about to get complicated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=120.08s)]
*  I mean, just in logistical terms. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  Here we are in addition to the 34 felony counts he is facing in New York state concerning [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  hush money payments made to affect his election to the White House in the first place in 2016. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=130.4s)]
*  In addition to the 40 felony counts he is facing already in federal court in Florida [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=135.54s)]
*  related to his handling of sensitive national security material and alleged destruction [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  of evidence after he left office. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=144.54s)]
*  Now we have four new federal felony charges unsealed against the former president for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=147.94s)]
*  conduct of his while he was president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=153.5s)]
*  He's due in court, Washington, D.C., 4 p.m. on Thursday to be arraigned on these charges. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=160.1s)]
*  He is charged with obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=165.28s)]
*  He's charged with three different conspiracy counts. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=171.28s)]
*  He's charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=173.64s)]
*  He's charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=177.16s)]
*  And he's charged with conspiracy against rights. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=180.56s)]
*  Now that charge has an interesting history. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=183.76s)]
*  It's section 241 of the U.S. code. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=185.96s)]
*  And it makes it a crime to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any person [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=188.56s)]
*  in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=194.56s)]
*  or the laws of the United States. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=199.32s)]
*  Now it sounds like a general sort of generic definition of what a crime is like. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=201.48s)]
*  But what this specifically is is something that was enacted by Congress after the Civil [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=207.32s)]
*  War so federal agents could go after southern whites, including the Ku Klux Klan, who were [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=211.12s)]
*  essentially in terrorism to prevent black Americans from voting. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=219.28s)]
*  That is the origin of this part of the U.S. Criminal Code. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=224.56s)]
*  So that fourth count against Trump, that conspiracy against rights, it's something that is sometimes [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=227.52s)]
*  called the Ku Klux Klan Act. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=232.78s)]
*  It has really chilling resonance because of its historical origins. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=234.56s)]
*  In terms of how it is used now, though, it's no longer something that is so tightly associated [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=239.76s)]
*  with racial terrorism. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=244.64s)]
*  In the modern era, it has been used more broadly, including especially in cases of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=246.6s)]
*  voting fraud conspiracies, vote rigging, casting false votes, conspiring to not properly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=250.76s)]
*  count the properly cast votes in an election, all those sorts of things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=258.38s)]
*  Those are the four charges. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=263.84s)]
*  And let's start tonight by talking about how the indictment lays this out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=265.0s)]
*  First of all, as I mentioned, it is unequivocally clear, and this is now new territory for us [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=269.84s)]
*  as a country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=275.4s)]
*  The indictment is very clear that it is about conduct that happened while Trump was president. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=276.4s)]
*  All four felony counts in the indictment have specific dates on them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=282.48s)]
*  And they're all while Trump was president. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=287.08s)]
*  They all start on November 14th, 2020. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=288.96s)]
*  The significance of that date, according to the indictment, according to the special counsel's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=292.76s)]
*  allegations against the president, is that November 14th is the day the indictment says [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=296.96s)]
*  Trump knew he lost the election. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=301.34s)]
*  So all four felonies are alleged to have started to be committed as of November 14th, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=304.68s)]
*  2020. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=310.0s)]
*  And the conduct described in the indictments then ends on a couple of accounts on January [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=311.0s)]
*  7th, 2021, so the day after the attack on Congress. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=316.52s)]
*  And the other two counts, the conduct ends on January 20th, 2021, so at the inauguration [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=320.36s)]
*  of Joe Biden. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=327.32s)]
*  This is all conduct that took place while Trump was president. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=328.52s)]
*  Now, whatever national agita we may have had about whether a sitting president can ever [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=333.16s)]
*  be held accountable for his crimes, now as of today, we know by this action from the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=338.8s)]
*  U.S. Justice Department that even if the U.S. Justice Department does think a sitting president [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  can't have charges brought against him while he's still sitting as president, now we know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  for sure that the Justice Department is willing to bring charges against someone for actions [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=353.56s)]
*  they committed while they were president. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=358.32000000000005s)]
*  They just apparently insist on waiting until he's out of office to bring those charges. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=361.3s)]
*  It's interesting, he is described throughout the indictment as Donald J. Trump and the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=366.74s)]
*  defendant. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  He is at one point at the very outset of the defendant described as someone who, quote, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=372.76s)]
*  was the 45th president of the United States, but he is never again described as President [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump because he is no longer president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  He is just a citizen now being charged for having tried to overthrow the government by [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=384.76s)]
*  force when he was president. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-CsKXl31_c&t=390.34s)]
