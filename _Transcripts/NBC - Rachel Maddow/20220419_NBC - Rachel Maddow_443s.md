# Russia Narrows Military Focus In New Phase Of War On Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs)
*  250 miles north of Mariupol is the second largest city in Ukraine, the city of Kharkiv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a big city. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=5.2s)]
*  It's a cosmopolitan city. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=6.4s)]
*  It's being targeted with Russian missile strikes today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=7.92s)]
*  Reporters in the city of Kharkiv say those strikes appear to have been aimed right into [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=11.44s)]
*  residential neighborhoods in the city. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=15.84s)]
*  The New York Times had two reports out of Kharkiv today reporting on what appears to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=18.56s)]
*  be—what appear to be adjustments in the Russian strategy in this part of the war, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=22.28s)]
*  trying to avoid the same mistakes that they made in their initial invasion when they went [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=28.0s)]
*  in all over the country, when they tried and failed to take the capital of Kiev. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=32.4s)]
*  The New York Times today quote, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=37.2s)]
*  Known as shaping operations in military circles, these smaller Russian attacks are often precursors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=58.24s)]
*  to larger troop movements or serve as a distraction from other fronts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=64.16s)]
*  Joining us now from Kharkiv is the correspondent for the New York Times, who's the lead byline [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=69.56s)]
*  in both of those reports. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=73.52s)]
*  His name is Thomas Gibbons Neff. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=74.44s)]
*  Mr. Gibbons Neff is the Kabul bureau chief for the New York Times, but he spent the last [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=76.0s)]
*  month reporting on the ground from Ukraine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=79.28s)]
*  He brings unique experience to this reporting job. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=81.16s)]
*  He's also served our country as a Marine infantryman with two tours in Afghanistan. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=83.4s)]
*  Mr. Gibbons Neff, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=88.92s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=92.0s)]
*  So we've been following your reports from Kharkiv and your reports from all the reporting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=93.84s)]
*  that you've done in Ukraine closely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=98.16s)]
*  Can you just give us an update on the scale of what's happening in terms of this phase [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=100.12s)]
*  of the war and what Russia appears to be trying to accomplish? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=104.12s)]
*  Right, it's tough. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=108.32s)]
*  And as you had kind of read in the articles that we had written, they have narrowed their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=109.16s)]
*  focus, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=113.84s)]
*  They have thousands of troops kind of located in the east preparing for a larger offensive, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  but taking much less ground than they had set out for in February. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=122.08s)]
*  So that just looks different this time instead of having armored columns and infantry advances [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=126.8s)]
*  and helicopter insertions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=132.4s)]
*  They're kind of advancing very slowly from predetermined front lines that they've established [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=134.76s)]
*  in the last month and a half, two months. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=140.28s)]
*  So a lot of that's going to look like a lot of artillery fire and then slowly moving their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  troops underneath that artillery fire as they weaken Ukrainian positions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=147.92s)]
*  It sounds more efficient the way you describe it that way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=153.16s)]
*  I don't know anything about military tactics, and I'm not a veteran like you are who've [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=156.2s)]
*  seen these things at a personal level. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  But it sounds just from a layman's perspective, the way that you're describing that, that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=162.32s)]
*  this is going to be a massive show of force, that it's going to be grinding, but that it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=166.04s)]
*  also seems to have more military chance of success than the earlier tactics that they [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=170.44s)]
*  used in earlier parts of the war. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=176.72s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  I think for the most part, I think it's just going to be it's going to be a lot slower. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=180.76s)]
*  And I think a lot of that has to do with keeping casualty numbers lower as before in the early [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=184.16s)]
*  parts of the war. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=189.56s)]
*  They suffered, the Russians and the Ukrainians suffered a lot of casualties just in those [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=190.92s)]
*  those early weeks and February to March. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=195.12s)]
*  So however it turns out, again, it'll be just much more concerted and where Russian forces [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=199.2s)]
*  will focus on weak points where they can kind of gain as much ground as possible before [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=204.88s)]
*  stopping and regrouping. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=209.48s)]
*  What does this mean for the civilians who are in the path of this this part of the Russian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=212.4s)]
*  offensive? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=218.4s)]
*  Obviously, what we have seen in the places where there has been sustained and concerted [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=219.16s)]
*  fighting is that Russia is basically destroying the places that it's trying to take over. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=223.28s)]
*  The city of Mariupol is in many, to a large extent, rubble. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=228.16s)]
*  And that's true in a lot of cities in eastern Ukraine that have been the target of sustained [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=232.88s)]
*  fighting thus far. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=236.32s)]
*  Is there any effort, is there any strategic imperative to try to preserve anything about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  the livability of these cities or any of its infrastructure? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=243.76s)]
*  Or are they just raising things to the ground? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=246.52s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of this going forward and I think what we've seen so far is there's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=251.08s)]
*  been a focus on weapons of the US and the West is supplied like the Javelin, which is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=255.44s)]
*  an anti-tank guided missile that's gotten a lot of attention. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=260.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is this is an artillery war and that means a lot of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=265.0s)]
*  destruction no matter where the fighting is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=268.92s)]
*  So and of course, just like in any conflict, the civilians, the innocents are caught in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=272.56s)]
*  the middle. So as this moves in the east, people living in towns and cities will will [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=277.6s)]
*  be caught in the middle if they're not if they can't evacuate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, there's there's always a big chunk of people who just stay behind because they [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=286.76s)]
*  can't leave. They're taking care of elderly family members. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=290.36s)]
*  They're sick. So again, whatever happens next, it's going to be the civilians caught in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=293.16s)]
*  the middle that will bear the brunt of this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=299.44s)]
*  In the United States, there's been a lot of attention to the shift in what the US government [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=302.68s)]
*  is providing, that the US is providing artillery rounds and howitzers and the other kinds of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=308.48s)]
*  weapons that at least echo the way that Russia is fighting its side of the war. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=314.32s)]
*  Do you believe that any of the weapons shipments from the United States, from the European [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=319.2s)]
*  Union, from any Ukraine's other allies could make a difference? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=323.2s)]
*  Is there enough material that can be moved into Ukraine to help them find some sort of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=326.68s)]
*  equipoise in this conflict or even to turn the tables? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's that's always the question. And I think just from what we've heard, the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=337.36s)]
*  shortage of ammunition, I mean, it really comes down to bullets and band-aids that they [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=342.76s)]
*  need a lot of that to the Ukrainians need a lot of that to hold the line, let alone [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  retake territory. So it remains to be seen, but it'll be something I think that the west, the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=352.6s)]
*  United States especially, is keeping a pretty close eye on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=358.04s)]
*  In terms of your plans and your reporting, I mentioned that you've got unique experience [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=361.76s)]
*  because you're on personal history that you bring to this reporting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=366.6s)]
*  But what are your plans? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I have to get too specific with me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=371.92s)]
*  Do you feel like you and your colleagues can safely report from where you are in Ukraine? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=373.36s)]
*  Do you have plans to move to try to stay in safer places? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=379.88s)]
*  I mean, as far as I mean, Kharkiv is shelled daily. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=386.28s)]
*  I think you said it's at the beginning. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=389.8s)]
*  It's a it's a it's a big city. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=391.32s)]
*  There's there's places outside of the shelling where where we can stay. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=393.04s)]
*  But I mean, I think again, going forward, I mean, we have every intent of covering this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=396.96s)]
*  this war, where it is and where this offensive pushes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=402.24s)]
*  Thomas Givens Neff, Kabul bureau chief of The New York Times, joining us now after four [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=406.68s)]
*  o'clock in the morning from Kharkiv, Ukraine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=412.56s)]
*  I'm not helping you do your job by keeping up till past four in the morning to talk to me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=414.56s)]
*  I'll let you go, sir. Thank you very much for your time and good luck. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=418.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TjKej3rKs&t=421.52s)]
