# 'Unadulterated disaster': Trump spends first 100 days sabotaging what makes America great
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8)
*  President Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan, in one of his first interviews [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=0.0s)]
*  since President Biden left office, says that, from a national security perspective, in his [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=4.84s)]
*  estimation, Trump's first 100 days in office have been a, quote, unadulterated disaster. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=9.84s)]
*  He says, quote, President Trump and his team have gone at the core American advantages [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  in the world and systematically tried to dismantle them across all of the major dimensions of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=21.26s)]
*  the things that have been America's major advantages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=26.84s)]
*  In less than 100 days, President Trump has put them all at risk. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=30.08s)]
*  He says, quote, this is about the core foundations of American power and purpose in the world [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=34.84s)]
*  and President Trump's effort, essentially, to knock them out. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=40.44s)]
*  Joining us now is Jake Sullivan, former national security adviser to President Biden. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=44.28s)]
*  Mr. Sullivan, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=48.24s)]
*  I know you haven't done many interviews and I really appreciate you being here tonight [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=50.32s)]
*  for this one. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=53.68s)]
*  Well, thanks a lot for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=55.68s)]
*  I'm struck by the stark nature of what you said when you say that President Trump is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=59.56s)]
*  dismantling America's core advantages in the world, the things that have been our major [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=67.48s)]
*  advantages, the things that make us the power that we are. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=74.76s)]
*  You describe him as systematically dismantling those things. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=78.08s)]
*  What are those advantages? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=81.36s)]
*  Do you see his work against them as being irrevocable? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=83.56s)]
*  Well, Rachel, I wouldn't say this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=89.76s)]
*  I'm not a person who usually speaks in hyperbole. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  I say it because I genuinely believe it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=94.56s)]
*  You ask what are those advantages? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=96.56s)]
*  And there are a few. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=99.2s)]
*  It begins with America's unique system of alliances. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=100.2s)]
*  No other power in the world has the strong, capable allies the United States has enjoyed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=103.76s)]
*  and Donald Trump is intent on busting up those alliances. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  It's our unique capacity to attract talent from around the world. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=113.64s)]
*  We can count on the talent of 7 billion people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=117.64s)]
*  China can only count on the talent of 1 billion people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  But Donald Trump is casting doubt on whether we will be a welcoming place for students [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  and researchers and people who want to come here to start companies. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=128.64s)]
*  It's about a unique system of scientific research and innovation where the government, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=132.4s)]
*  the private sector, and yes, research universities all come together to invent some of the most [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=138.12s)]
*  groundbreaking things of the past century. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=144.68s)]
*  And yet he's going after basic research funding at NIH and he's going after major universities. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=146.88s)]
*  And finally, it's about our unique capital markets and our currency. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  And you saw when he did his quote unquote liberation day that the world started to question [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  whether America could really be relied upon for its capital markets and for the dollar. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=162.6s)]
*  And underpinning all of that, of course, is our unique constitutional system underpinned by the rule of law, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  which is you have quite articulately said he's put under threat in various ways. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  These are the things that are distinctively American. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  And in less than 100 days, President Trump has gone after all of them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=179.88000000000002s)]
*  I don't believe anything is ever irrevocable because I believe in the capacity of the American people [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=184.12s)]
*  to reinvent and regenerate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=188.36s)]
*  But the damage he has done so far is significant. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  And it appears that there's probably more to come. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=193.24s)]
*  If we lose those advantages, which you just I think very eloquently and succinctly described, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=197.96s)]
*  if you take those things away from America, what kind of country are we? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=204.68s)]
*  Is there another country in the world that has any of the other characteristics that we have as a country, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  but not those advantages? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=216.28s)]
*  Is there a country in the world that you think Trump is modeling us on or trying to make us more like? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=217.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, it certainly is taking us in the direction of a more authoritarian, more normal, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=223.72s)]
*  more brutal great power. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=229.56s)]
*  And that starts to look more like a China or Russia. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=231.96s)]
*  I mean, if you're sitting in Beijing right now and you're looking at what's happening in the United States, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=235.32s)]
*  you're saying, huh, we've spent a long time worried about these areas where the United States had a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=240.04s)]
*  distinct advantage over us. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=245.8s)]
*  We don't have the allies the U.S. had. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=247.32s)]
*  Now it appears the American president's handing them away. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't attract talent the way the United States does. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=252.52s)]
*  Now France is going out and saying, hey, come to France because you're scared to go to the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=255.24s)]
*  We don't have that uniquely American innovation ecosystem. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=260.92s)]
*  And yet the president of the United States is going at the basic research foundations and the institutions [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=265.56s)]
*  of higher learning that have set America apart. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=271.48s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=273.32s)]
*  So there is a kind of remarkable way in which the United States is going to go about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=274.12s)]
*  There is a remarkable way in which our competitors and adversaries have got to be looking at this and saying, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=278.92s)]
*  what the heck is going on? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=283.24s)]
*  And we can't believe our luck. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0k2aZONmP8&t=284.92s)]
