Video Description: Rachel Maddow recaps the day's arguments before the Supreme Court on "presidential immunity" and the lengths to which justices devoted to Donald Trump and the Republican Party went to accommodate Trump's audacious argument that he should be impervious from prosecution for his role in the January 6 insurrection.

# Murder, coup, bribery: Trump team stands by extreme hypotheticals in Supreme Court immunity case
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y)
*  The appeals court proceedings made headlines across the country after one of the three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  appellate judges who heard the appeal asked Trump's lawyer in court a shocking hypothetical [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=4.44s)]
*  about whether he could order the assassination of a political rival and really not be charged [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=10.32s)]
*  for it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=16.92s)]
*  Trump's counsel said indeed that was their position. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=18.84s)]
*  So all the federal judges who reviewed Trump's audacious immunity claim, all of them have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=24.48s)]
*  seemed not just disinclined to go along with it, they have seemed shocked by it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=30.1s)]
*  And their clarion decisions, again at the trial court level and at the appellate level, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=35.4s)]
*  their clarion decisions against him on this immunity question really seemed like they [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=39.88s)]
*  would be the last word. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=43.82s)]
*  But with this Supreme Court never say never. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  The United States Supreme Court sat on this issue for weeks and then finally announced [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=51.64s)]
*  that they wanted to take this case themselves. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=56.36s)]
*  They announced they would take it today, what is probably the latest possible day on which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=59.04s)]
*  they could have scheduled these arguments. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=63.84s)]
*  To the extent that Trump's best defense tactic is delay, the Supreme Court has already been [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=66.32s)]
*  an excellent accomplice in that defense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=72.4s)]
*  Even with that backdrop, the arguments today were legitimately, I think, stunning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=78.0s)]
*  Trump's counsel was grilled for about an hour, the counsel for prosecutor Jack Smith and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=85.72s)]
*  the Justice Department was grilled for nearly twice that amount of time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=90.08s)]
*  But almost immediately at the start of proceedings, under questioning from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=95.8s)]
*  we got confirmation that the appeals court hypothetical, that crazy hypothetical about [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=101.64s)]
*  Trump being able to assassinate his political enemies and never be charged for it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=106.82s)]
*  We got confirmation right at the start that that was not a fluke. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=111.52s)]
*  President Trump in fact maintains and his lawyers maintain that he really is immune [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=114.82s)]
*  from prosecution specifically for killing his political rivals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=119.69999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to give you a chance to say if you stay by it, if the president decides that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military or orders someone to assassinate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=133.7s)]
*  him, is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=143.61999999999998s)]
*  It would depend on the hypothetical, but we can see that could well be an official act. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  It could and why? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=152.94s)]
*  That could be an official act, really. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=155.5s)]
*  He might officially, as part of his presidential duties, want to kill his domestic political [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  rival. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=163.34s)]
*  And if it's an official act, Trump's lawyers say, well, he's immune from prosecution for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=164.58s)]
*  that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=168.5s)]
*  So, in other words, yes, we think he should be able to do that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=169.5s)]
*  Anything else you want to clarify that he should be able to do? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=172.74s)]
*  It turns out quite a bit, actually. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  It's not just assassinating his individual domestic political opponents. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=177.26s)]
*  It's worse than that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=181.62s)]
*  Over to you, Justice Kagan, again here questioning Trump's counsel, John Sauer. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=183.34s)]
*  If a president sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary, is that immune? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=189.9s)]
*  That sounds like, similar to the bribery example, likely not immune. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  Now, if it's structured as an official act, you would have to be impeached and convicted [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=198.94s)]
*  first before— [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=202.06s)]
*  What does that mean, if it's structured as an official act? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't know in the hypothetical whether or not that would be an official act. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=205.58s)]
*  You probably have to have more details to apply the blazing game analysis or even the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=208.82s)]
*  Fitzgerald analysis that we've been talking about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=214.02s)]
*  How about if a president orders the military to stage a coup? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=216.82s)]
*  I think that, as the Chief Justice pointed out earlier, where there is a whole series [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=224.14s)]
*  of, you know, sort of guidelines against that, so to speak, like the UCMJ, prohibits the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=228.42s)]
*  military from following a plainly unlawful act. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, if one adopts, for example, the Fitzgerald test that we advanced, that might well be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=237.54s)]
*  an official act, and it would have to be, as I'll say in response to all these kinds [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=241.22s)]
*  of hypotheticals, has to be impeached and convicted before it can be criminally prosecuted. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=244.52s)]
*  But I emphasized at the court— [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=249.22s)]
*  Well, he's gone. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=250.22s)]
*  Let's say this president who ordered the military to stage a coup. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  He's no longer president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=255.36s)]
*  He wasn't impeached. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=256.88s)]
*  He couldn't be impeached. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=257.88s)]
*  But he ordered the military to stage a coup, and you're saying that's an official act. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=261.18s)]
*  I think it would depend— [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  That's immune. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it would depend on the circumstances whether it was an official act. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  If it were an official act, again, he would have to be impeached— [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=270.76s)]
*  What does that mean, depend on the circumstances? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=273.04s)]
*  He was the president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=275.24s)]
*  He is the commander-in-chief. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=276.36s)]
*  He talks to his generals all the time, and he told the generals, I don't feel like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=279.92s)]
*  leaving office. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  I want a stage a coup. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  Is that immune? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=287.48s)]
*  If it's an official act, there needs to be impeachment and conviction beforehand, because [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=288.48s)]
*  the framers viewed the risk—that kind of very low risk— [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=292.76s)]
*  If it's an official act, is it an official act? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  If it's an official act, it's impeachment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  Is it an official act? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=299.48s)]
*  On the way you described that hypothetical, it could well be. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=300.94s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  You'd have to—again, it's a fact-specific context, a specific determination— [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  That answer sounds to me as though it's like, yeah, under my test, it's an official act, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=308.5s)]
*  but that sure sounds bad, doesn't it? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=312.78s)]
*  Well, it certainly sounds very bad, and that's why the framers have a whole series of structural [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=314.66s)]
*  checks that have successfully, for the last 234 years, prevented that very kind of extreme [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=320.52s)]
*  hypothetical. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=326.78s)]
*  Has that extreme hypothetical always been prevented? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=329.26s)]
*  But yes, Your Honor, that certainly, quote, sounds very bad. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=332.3s)]
*  You can see where he's going at the end of this, though, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=336.98s)]
*  When he calls that an extreme hypothetical, this is an important part, I believe, of how [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  today's proceedings went. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  Trump's lawyer and most of the conservative justice today carried on with these proceedings [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=345.46s)]
*  at the Supreme Court as if it is just a wild hypothetical, just a crazy pipe dream, like [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  a Martian scenario, that a president might try a coup, might try to use force to stay [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=356.64s)]
*  in power after he was voted out. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=362.4s)]
*  Yeah, who could ever imagine something like that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=363.96s)]
*  Trump's lawyer today called that unlikely. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=367.52s)]
*  He specifically called it, and I quote, very, very unlikely as a scenario today. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=369.84s)]
*  That is the wisdom of the framers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=377.56s)]
*  What they viewed as the risk that needed to be guarded against was not the notion that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=378.84s)]
*  the president might escape a criminal prosecution for something very, very unlikely in these [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=383.28s)]
*  unlikely scenarios. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=388.55999999999995s)]
*  They viewed much more likely and much more destructive to the republic the risk of factional [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=389.55999999999995s)]
*  strife discussed by George Washington. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=393.96s)]
*  Framers did not put an immunity clause into the Constitution. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  They knew how to. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=398.88s)]
*  There were immunity clauses in some state constitutions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=399.88s)]
*  They knew how to give legislative immunity. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  They didn't provide immunity to the president. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=405.4s)]
*  And not so surprising, they were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be above [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  the law. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=413.12s)]
*  Wasn't the whole point that the president was not a monarch? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=414.12s)]
*  The whole point of, you know, America, why we're a country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=418.36s)]
*  Justice Elena Kagan there with Trump counsel John Sauer. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=424.6s)]
*  Basically what he's saying there is the idea of anyone actually trying a coup to stay in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=428.96s)]
*  power, a president trying that, that's crazy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=434.36s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=437.48s)]
*  That's so extreme. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=438.48s)]
*  We don't have to worry about a hypothetical like that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=439.48s)]
*  It's really partisan strife. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=441.56s)]
*  It's really conflict between political parties. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=443.24s)]
*  That's the biggest risk to the country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=445.96s)]
*  Not this crazy idea of a potential coup. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=447.98s)]
*  Justice Kagan there responding by basically saying, yeah, okay, also, but maybe tyranny, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=451.4s)]
*  maybe a tyrant, unbound by law, running the country with impunity. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=455.92s)]
*  Maybe that would be bad for us too. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=459.74s)]
*  Maybe that's why we were actually formed as a constitutional republic. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=461.14s)]
*  As a general matter, it is folly to extrapolate from oral arguments and say that, you know, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=468.38s)]
*  how the ruling will come down based on the comments from the justices when the case was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=473.3s)]
*  heard. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=477.62s)]
*  With that caveat though, it seemed clear today that the most conservative justices were inclined [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=478.98s)]
*  to side with Trump, not just on a technicality, but possibly on the substance. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=487.06s)]
*  Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting today that presidents are always committing crimes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=494.22s)]
*  Shout out to Operation Mongoose from Justice Clarence Thomas today. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=499.46000000000004s)]
*  Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Samuel Alito today describing prosecutors and judges [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=504.5s)]
*  and even grand juries of citizens in terms that would be right at home in a Trump social [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=508.46000000000004s)]
*  media feed about how there isn't really a rule of law in this country and that what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  looks like our supposed legal system is really just corrupt people who are out to get Donald [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=517.64s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=522.46s)]
*  The conservative justices today were absolutely and consistently unwilling to discuss Trump's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=524.5s)]
*  alleged crimes as laid out in the indictment that led to this case to the point that it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=529.62s)]
*  became almost a comedic, gymnastic effort at avoidance between Justice Alito and the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=534.38s)]
*  lawyer for special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  If the court has concerns about the robustness of it, I would suggest looking at the charges [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=546.98s)]
*  in this case. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=552.94s)]
*  They... [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=553.94s)]
*  Well, I'm going to talk about this in the abstract. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=554.94s)]
*  Conspiracies to defraud the United States with respect to one of the most important [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  functions, namely the certification of the next president. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't want to dispute that particular application of that, of 371, conspiracy to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=565.0600000000001s)]
*  defraud the United States of the particular facts here. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  It's difficult to think of a more critical function than the certification of who won [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=574.94s)]
*  the election. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=579.6600000000001s)]
*  You know, as I said, I'm not discussing the particular facts of this case. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=580.6600000000001s)]
*  Stop, stop with the facts. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=584.86s)]
*  Stop the... [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=587.1s)]
*  Do not tell me about the things that whoever your client is did or the things in the indictment [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=588.94s)]
*  of whoever your client is that led to this case, whatever it's about. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=596.5s)]
*  I want to speak purely in the abstract as if the particular facts of this case, the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=600.58s)]
*  particular facts of what Donald Trump did, are actually just an unimaginable extreme [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=604.38s)]
*  hypothetical that I don't need to engage with. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=608.42s)]
*  The not consensus, but I think widely held view of today's proceedings at the United [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=614.26s)]
*  States Supreme Court is that the conservatives on the court will likely succeed in using [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=618.34s)]
*  this case to further and fatally delay criminal court proceedings against Donald Trump before [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=623.72s)]
*  the election in November. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=630.34s)]
*  Rather than reject his claims of immunity from prosecution, like all the federal judges [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=632.26s)]
*  who have considered this matter before them have done, they instead will carve out some [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=637.1s)]
*  newly specified class of actions that are immune from prosecution if you're a president. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=642.14s)]
*  And they will invent a test for deciding what counts as that kind of action by a president. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=648.5s)]
*  And then they will send Trump's indictment, Trump's federal January 6th case, back through [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=654.46s)]
*  a whole new cycle in the lower federal courts to run his attempted overthrow of the government [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=659.22s)]
*  through the court's newly invented legal test that they are going to make for him in this [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  case. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=670.02s)]
*  Which yes, will take forever because in the meantime, of course, he will get a chance [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  to get back into the White House in order to shut the whole thing down. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=676.48s)]
*  And in the meantime, the American people will be asked to go and vote on whether he should [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=680.78s)]
*  take that seat again in the White House without knowing what federal prosecutors have found [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=683.98s)]
*  and believe is criminal about his conduct when he tried to overthrow the government [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=688.74s)]
*  to stay in office the last time. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COYH7LRlf7Y&t=693.2199999999999s)]
