# U.S. religious extremists help push radical anti-gay laws in Africa
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc)
*  Last year, Republicans in Arizona lined up behind a bill that would have punished teachers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=0.0s)]
*  and opened them up to lawsuits. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=5.8s)]
*  The idea was this, if a student was, for example, scared to tell his or her family that they [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=7.36s)]
*  were gay or transgender or thinking about those issues, and the student decided instead [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=13.48s)]
*  to talk with their teacher about it, well, this Arizona law would create an affirmative [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=19.32s)]
*  legal obligation for the teacher, forcing the teacher to call the student's parent [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=24.26s)]
*  and tell. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=28.88s)]
*  And if the teacher didn't do it, Arizona Republicans said that teacher should lose his or her [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=30.08s)]
*  license and it should be okay for the teacher to be sued as an individual. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=33.68s)]
*  During that same session, Republicans also pushed legislation that would have banned [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=39.72s)]
*  books like Maya Angelou's book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, or George Orwell's 1984, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=43.12s)]
*  or F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=50.68s)]
*  They'd all be banned. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=52.76s)]
*  Some critics say that because of the way that bill was originally crafted, it would have [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=55.84s)]
*  also made it illegal to teach anything at all about homosexuality. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=59.32s)]
*  You could not say that it exists. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=64.72s)]
*  What those two bills had in common is that to create those bills, Republicans in Arizona [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=68.24s)]
*  consulted with the same far-right interest group, a group called Family Watch International. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=73.48s)]
*  It's based in Arizona. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=79.88s)]
*  But while that group is based in Arizona, they really only dabble in this stuff in the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  United States, where they really do most of their work is overseas. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=85.72s)]
*  This is a right-wing anti-gay group in America, in Arizona, that for years has backed anti-gay [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=89.64s)]
*  legislation in countries like Nigeria, where same-sex relationships are punishable by death, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=96.1s)]
*  depending on what part of the country you're in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  Along the way, this Arizona group has also forged close ties with the virulently anti-gay [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  activists who were enthusiastic supporters in parliament of Uganda's previous kill the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=110.8s)]
*  gays bill. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=117.28s)]
*  In March of this year, just weeks ago, this Arizona group was one of the key organizers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=119.32s)]
*  of a conference in Uganda that hosted lawmakers, hosted elected officials from more than a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=123.44s)]
*  dozen countries in Africa. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=129.4s)]
*  At this conference, again, organized by an Arizona conservative group, lawmakers from [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=131.44s)]
*  more than a dozen countries gathered in Uganda and promised that in their home countries, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=135.84s)]
*  they would push legislation against the sin of homosexuality. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=141.24s)]
*  Here's the head of Family Watch International meeting with her longtime friend, the First [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=146.72s)]
*  Lady of Uganda, at that conference. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=150.96s)]
*  The First Lady said that during that most recent meeting, they discussed, in her words, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=153.2s)]
*  concern about the imposition of harmful practices like homosexuality. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=157.56s)]
*  What can activists taking that message abroad? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=163.6s)]
*  Well now, Family Watch International's efforts appear to be paying off. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, the parliament in Uganda passed what amounts to a new kill the gays [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=171.92s)]
*  bill that would impose the death penalty for certain offenses. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=177.24s)]
*  It calls for life in prison for anybody who has gay sex. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=181.72s)]
*  It makes it illegal to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  The White House has already come out hard against this legislation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=191.0s)]
*  Before I turn it over to my NSC colleague here, I want to say one thing at the top. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=200.8s)]
*  We have grave concerns with the passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Act, AHA, by the parliament [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=206.52s)]
*  of Uganda yesterday, and increasing violence targeting LGBTQI plus persons. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=212.56s)]
*  The bill is one of the most extreme anti-LGBTQI plus laws in the world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=218.16s)]
*  Human rights are universal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=225.32s)]
*  No one should be attacked, imprisoned, or killed simply because of who they are or whom [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=227.04s)]
*  they love. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=233.48s)]
*  Strong criticism from the White House by the Biden administration for this proposed new [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=235.28s)]
*  kill the gays law in Uganda. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=238.4s)]
*  The status of it right now is that it's been sent back to the parliament in Uganda for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=240.64s)]
*  quote strengthening. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=245.08s)]
*  Apparently the president of Uganda wanted a provision adding a provision added regarding [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  so-called conversion therapy to cure people of being gay. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=252.52s)]
*  But as far as we know, this thing could be reintroduced as soon as tomorrow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=256.2s)]
*  Our next guest who's joining us live from Uganda is one of the most accomplished, most [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  respected LGBTQ rights activists in that whole part of the world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=265.8s)]
*  He told us today that the parliament in his country has issued notice that it's going [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=269.58000000000004s)]
*  this bill during tomorrow's session. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=273.84s)]
*  He says members of parliament have confirmed that tomorrow may in fact be the day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  What that means for us here in this country is that yes, the Biden administration has [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=279.88s)]
*  already spoken out about this bill, but if they are going to turn up the heat on this, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  if they are really going to try to use their influence to stop this, the time is now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=288.12s)]
*  The time is right now, as in as in tonight. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=292.64s)]
*  Joining us now from Uganda's capital city of Kampala is Frank Mugisha. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=297.73999999999995s)]
*  He's the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=301.2s)]
*  Mr. Mugisha, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=304.0s)]
*  I know I know it's a dangerous time for you to be speaking out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=306.64s)]
*  And I also know that it's the middle of the night where you are. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=310.92s)]
*  I really appreciate you being here, sir. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=314.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=317.36s)]
*  And thank you so much for amplifying our voice. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Now and back then when the Cure the Gay Bill was just introduced, we appreciate that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=321.4s)]
*  But we did we need that for our voices to be amplified, not only in Uganda, but also [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=326.56s)]
*  in other parts of Africa where this kind of legislation is being introduced. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=331.68s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=336.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=337.2s)]
*  We, as you mentioned, we we covered the initial iteration of this bill in 2009 when that was [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=338.2s)]
*  it went through a long process when it was eventually shelved. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=347.04s)]
*  Can you tell us about the difference? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=349.68s)]
*  Is this essentially a continuation of that same idea? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=351.56s)]
*  Is this worse in some ways? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=354.08s)]
*  Is it similar legislation? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=355.36s)]
*  This legislation is very, very draconian and extreme. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=359.16s)]
*  This legislation, in my words, and I've said it many times, it is here to erase the entire [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=364.48s)]
*  existence of an LGBTQ person in Uganda. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=370.36s)]
*  But also it radicalizes Ugandans into hatred of the LGBTQ community. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=375.12s)]
*  And we're already seeing that happening. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  This could lead to mob justice. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=383.88s)]
*  This could lead to people getting disowned by their own families because it compels every [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=386.28s)]
*  person to report any person who is known as an LGBTQ person to the authorities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=392.08s)]
*  So this bill is more extreme than the one that was introduced in 2009. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=398.92s)]
*  Compelling other citizens to report fellow citizens, fellow Ugandans who they believe [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=403.64s)]
*  to be gay. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=411.24s)]
*  Tell me, we have seen some coverage in the United States, including I think some important [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=413.08s)]
*  reporting in the New York Times about LGBTQ Ugandans fleeing the country, going to Kenya [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=417.08s)]
*  and going to other places, basically trying to avoid the kind of mob justice, the kind [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=423.2s)]
*  of vigilante violence that you're describing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=427.48s)]
*  What do you think, if this passes, what do you think this law would mean for people who [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  are out, for people who are activists like yourself? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=434.72s)]
*  If this law is passed, we will definitely see many people get arrested. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=439.04s)]
*  We will see many LGBTQ persons leave the country. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=444.04s)]
*  So many of the LGBTQ community members are already fleeing the country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=448.92s)]
*  They're trying to go to neighboring Kenya, which is not safe as well. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  But they feel they would be safer in Kenya than be in prison in Uganda. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  And we're already seeing Ugandans, like I said, radicalized, hating on LGBTQ persons. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing violence. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=467.96s)]
*  We're seeing many cases of violence, social exclusion, people getting beaten. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=468.96s)]
*  So we're seeing that increase. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  If this bill is passed or signed by the president, we'll definitely see many of the LGBTQ community [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  members leave the country. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=482.64s)]
*  We'll see many people get arrested. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=485.0s)]
*  People like myself who are outspoken, I could end up getting arrested. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  And many of my colleagues who are outspoken as well could end up being in prison. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=490.44s)]
*  Mr. Maguishy, I just have to ask you, if it made a difference for the Obama administration, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=495.36s)]
*  for the U.S. government to speak out against this proposed legislation when we saw an earlier [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=500.92s)]
*  iteration of this years ago, and in your opinion, would it make a major difference if the Biden [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=506.0s)]
*  administration, if American politicians of all stripes took a firmer stand on this, took [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=511.4s)]
*  a louder stand on this, and put pressure on your country's government to not do it? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=517.32s)]
*  Would it make a difference if America stood up? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=521.66s)]
*  It would make a very big difference if Americans spoke directly to our Ugandan authorities [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=525.0s)]
*  and told them how dangerous this legislation is for the LGBTQ community here and how this [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=530.56s)]
*  legislation is going to make the LGBTQ community unsafe living here in Uganda. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=536.16s)]
*  And now this legislation is a gross violation of human rights of LGBTQ persons. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pStjPnOQgc&t=541.4399999999999s)]
