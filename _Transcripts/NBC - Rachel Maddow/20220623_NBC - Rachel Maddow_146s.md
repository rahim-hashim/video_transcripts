# Clark Caught In A Contradiction: Why Claiming The Fifth And Privilege Can't Coexist
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8)
*  Can I make a procedural point that actually is important? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=0.0s)]
*  Usually procedure, it's like, OK, who cares? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=2.64s)]
*  They've talked to over 1,000 people. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=5.32s)]
*  The cooperation rate is above 98%. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=7.76s)]
*  Who are the people that are either resisting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=12.24s)]
*  by claiming the fifth so much that we're not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=15.36s)]
*  getting words out of them or defying Peter Navarro, who's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=17.52s)]
*  in the tweet about come to January 6, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=23.0s)]
*  John Eastman, who's plotting the coup, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=25.72s)]
*  Steve Bannon, who was talking openly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  through his internet networks and war room about, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=30.96s)]
*  it's going to be wild. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=33.32s)]
*  It's going to be fast moving. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=34.36s)]
*  Be ready for the sixth. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=35.28s)]
*  Why was he so excited about the physical tactical aspects [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=36.6s)]
*  of the sixth? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=39.28s)]
*  And Mr. Clark, PJ's, PJ Clark, if you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=40.2s)]
*  want to give him a new nickname, is claiming the fifth wall [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=44.0s)]
*  claiming privilege. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  We saw that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  That was new today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=50.28s)]
*  Well, it can't be both. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=51.28s)]
*  If you have grounds to incriminate yourself [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=52.92s)]
*  of a crime, then it's not privilege [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=56.16s)]
*  because the crime fraud exception [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  eliminates the privilege. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=59.44s)]
*  He's bad enough at lawyering for himself [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=60.76s)]
*  that he goes, you know, fifth slash privilege, no. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  Fifth is criminal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=66.12s)]
*  Then you'd have no privilege. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=67.12s)]
*  And so it's very interesting, Rachel, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=68.32s)]
*  that at this point, some of the few people who have not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=70.0s)]
*  cooperated, Mr. Meadow stands in the middle of all that, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  although the DOJ did not pursue him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=74.72s)]
*  So they decided that for their reasons, out of fairness [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=76.28s)]
*  to him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=78.52s)]
*  But these are all people who are very close to what Lawrence [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=79.52s)]
*  just identified. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=81.78s)]
*  We were told in testimony today Donald Trump didn't [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  know whether he could fire Mr. Clark or not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=85.44s)]
*  and whether anyone said that authority. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=88.8s)]
*  That's how fuzzy he was on the org chart. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=90.34s)]
*  But he did have a bunch of people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  coming in to do this, like, office assignment level detail [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=94.88s)]
*  at DOJ. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=98.44s)]
*  In order to get this plan effectuated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=99.2s)]
*  And that overlaps with a very small number of people [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=100.44s)]
*  who are resisting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=102.6s)]
*  Maybe they think that's worse, telling the truth about that, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  than being in trouble for resisting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=106.2s)]
*  The person who gets people into DOJ [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  is the White House counsel, who Liz Cheney publicly [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=108.96s)]
*  on Tuesday pleaded with to come and testify. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=110.92s)]
*  Pat Cipollone. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=112.84s)]
*  Yeah, and John McAtee we saw, too. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=113.64s)]
*  We know who the people are in the White House who could easily [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=115.76s)]
*  and in 15 minutes drop someone into DOJ on December 15. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=117.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9GIpOgGLz8&t=121.04s)]
