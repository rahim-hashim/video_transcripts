# The Rachel Maddow Show - July 7 | Audio Only
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ)
*  Good evening, you guys. I have to ask you if you got the dreaded control room warning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You guys, you guys, Rachel might not be ready. Did they actually tell you that? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=6.76s)]
*  They didn't tell us, but they said, take our time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=10.84s)]
*  Just take your time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=13.64s)]
*  So this involves randomly sticking a finger into some mascara and then touching my face, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=15.84s)]
*  like right in the middle of my face, immediately before the lights came on. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=23.44s)]
*  You know, Rachel, just so you don't feel alone, I've done that on occasion too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=29.2s)]
*  I just had to put a little bit right under the eye. I understand. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  There you go. You can pass it off as like a football thing or something, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=36.4s)]
*  but for me, it was like a very, very failed effort to make a beauty spot. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  It really didn't work. So thank you for saving me from that, you guys. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  All right. Much appreciated, you guys. Thank you so much. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=50.72s)]
*  All right. You never know. It's live TV. Anything can happen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much at home for joining me this hour. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=56.8s)]
*  Really, really happy to have you here. I was away last week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=60.08s)]
*  I want to thank everybody on Team Jen Psaki for filling in for me while I had the night off. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  Very kind of everybody. I know it's lots of work, but it's good to be back. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=66.44s)]
*  We, of course, have eyes tonight on central Texas, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=70.92s)]
*  where rescue and recovery operations are now into their fourth night [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=74.56s)]
*  and where Texas officials say the death toll has now topped more than 100 lives lost [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=80.16000000000001s)]
*  in this terrible, terrible flash flooding centering on Kerr County, Texas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=86.92s)]
*  This is now officially one of the deadliest floods in the United States in decades. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  We're going to have eyes there throughout the night again as rescue and recovery efforts head into the fourth night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=98.04s)]
*  We're also going to be talking tonight with a meteorologist and journalist who just before these storms [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  was trying to publicly sound the alarm about the Trump administration [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=110.6s)]
*  dismantling important parts of the National Weather Service [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=114.64s)]
*  and the consequences of that for any part of our country facing severe weather. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=117.36s)]
*  We've got that expert perspective from a very prescient person [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=121.96s)]
*  who was warning about these things just ahead of this disaster. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=126.28s)]
*  We've got that coming up this hour tonight. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=129.4s)]
*  We've also got a live report tonight this hour from a lawyer who just made a bombshell discovery [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=131.72s)]
*  about President Donald Trump's ongoing efforts to ship people off to random foreign countries [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=139.2s)]
*  for potentially lifetime imprisonment without trial. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  The subject of this new revelation, this is something the Trump administration [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=148.32s)]
*  has publicly denied. It is something they may have lied to the courts about, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  but it has now been discovered and it has the potential to really mess up the Trump [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=157.76s)]
*  administration's efforts in court in all of these cases that they are already repeatedly losing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  A big new surprise revelation that is adverse to the Trump administration [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=169.2s)]
*  discovered today by a lawyer who has been up against them in court on these really, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  really outrageous, radical immigration deportation sort of international gulag stories. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=178.96s)]
*  We've got that story for you coming up here tonight, both of those stories coming up tonight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  But I gotta tell you, it's been a strange day in the news for a whole bunch of reasons. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=189.92s)]
*  You might remember before the election in November, there was a little story. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=195.68s)]
*  We covered it here on the show. You might remember it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=200.96s)]
*  It was a statue that mysteriously appeared on the National Mall in Washington. Do you remember this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  It was a larger than life depiction in bronze of Nancy Pelosi's desk. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=211.36s)]
*  It had a nameplate on the desk that said Nancy Pelosi. It had a landline phone cast in bronze [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=217.28s)]
*  and bronze post-it notes and file folders and also cast in bronze right there on the desk, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=223.12s)]
*  gigantic. There was a huge poop, a stylized poop in the shape of a swirly poop emoji right there in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=229.28s)]
*  the middle of the desk. And this weird bronze statue went up on the National Mall just before [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  the election. It was an anonymous artwork. It was titled the Resolute Desk. Nobody knows who put it up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=244.08s)]
*  But this statue, this piece of art, it had a very, very formal looking plaque that made clear [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=250.48s)]
*  what it was about. The plaque said, quote, this memorial honors the brave men and women who broke [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=260.8s)]
*  into the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021 to loot, urinate, and defecate throughout those hollowed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=266.08s)]
*  halls in order to overturn an election. President Trump celebrates these heroes of January 6th as, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=273.36s)]
*  unbelievable patriots and warriors. This monument stands as a testament to their [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=280.8s)]
*  daring sacrifice and lasting legacy. So that was the plaque on that poop on the desk statue [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  that went up on the National Mall in October just before the election. And then whoever did it, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=295.36s)]
*  we still don't know, did a follow-up. They said, gave her statement to a reporter at DC News Now, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  we figured that a monument isn't a real monument until cheap souvenirs are involved. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=308.88s)]
*  That's why, just like the heroes who invaded the Capitol and landed some sweet laptops, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=313.76s)]
*  iPads, and a John Lewis photo, we wanted people to have something to take home with them from this [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=318.64s)]
*  monument. So they made brochures celebrating what they called the Trump National January 6th [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Memorial, again, the poop desk. They also made little foam replicas of the poop, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=333.84s)]
*  a little swirly poop on a plinth. Trump National January 6th Memorial, it says on the little plaque [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  there, little foam replicas. They gave them away near that statue on the National Mall under a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=345.84s)]
*  sign that said, free, please take only one. Of course, as soon as Trump got elected, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  he immediately did pardon all the January 6th convicts, including the guy from Brooklyn who [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=358.0s)]
*  publicly bragged indeed about having pooped inside the Capitol. Trump pardoned him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=363.44s)]
*  Then there was more. In Philadelphia and in Portland, Oregon, formal-looking statues were [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=372.64s)]
*  put up of Trump looking very portly, wearing a suit. These were statues that purported to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=379.44s)]
*  honor him for a quote, lifetime of sexual assault. In New York State, the Donald J. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=385.44s)]
*  Trump State Park in Yorktown Heights, New York, somebody put up a thing they called [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=394.64s)]
*  the very large Donald J. Trump monument. And the thing was in fact gigantic. It's kind of hard to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=399.36s)]
*  get a sense of the scale of it here. But if you look at those little votive candles that are left [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=404.72s)]
*  on the steps there, you'll get a sense of it. This plinth, this sculptural base is huge. It's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=408.96s)]
*  more than seven feet wide. The whole thing is more than eight feet tall. But perched on top of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=414.0s)]
*  all of it, the whole thing is setting up this teeny, teeny, teeny, tiny little thing on top, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=420.72s)]
*  a little tiny mushroom, which is the very large Donald J. Trump monument. That little tiny golden [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=427.44s)]
*  mushroom is a very specific reference to Donald Trump, one that I cannot explain because I am [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=435.84s)]
*  easily embarrassed. Then there was the tiki torch statue, eight foot tall hand holding a tiki torch [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=443.84s)]
*  that was put up on Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. That's a reference to the neo-Nazi and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=452.56s)]
*  neo-Confederate torch lit march through Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. There was a [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=457.2s)]
*  plaque on that one as well. It said, quote, this monument pays tribute to President Donald Trump [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=462.32s)]
*  and the very fine people he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=467.2s)]
*  After that, there was a few months when we didn't have any new ones, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  but now apparently we're back in business. This one went up recently in Washington, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=481.52s)]
*  also about eight feet tall. It's really big. It shows Trump's signature thumbs up photo pose [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=486.88s)]
*  smashing down onto the crown of the Statue of Liberty. It says in bronze letters across the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=493.76s)]
*  front, dictator approved. Then on the four sides of the base, it has four quotes from dictators, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=498.96s)]
*  all praising Trump. There's a quote praising Trump from Vladimir Putin, one from Viktor Orban, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=506.0s)]
*  one from Jair Bolsonaro and one from Kim Jong-un. That dictator approved one went up a few weeks [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=511.52s)]
*  ago in roughly the same place as the Pelosi desk poop statue. The White House was apparently very [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=518.72s)]
*  unhappy about this one. They put out a sort of sad, scoldy, petulant statement about it. They said, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=525.44s)]
*  quote, in the United States of America, you have the freedom to display your so-called art, no [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=533.44s)]
*  matter how ugly it is. They actually said that in a White House statement. The people who created [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=540.64s)]
*  that so-called art apparently heard that statement from the White House and thought, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=546.96s)]
*  challenge accepted. Washingtonian magazine got a comment from one of the anonymous organizers [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=551.84s)]
*  behind that piece of art who told them that once the White House put out that statement, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=558.32s)]
*  you have the freedom to display your so-called art, no matter how ugly it is. Once they heard [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=564.48s)]
*  that from the White House as an official White House statement, they decided they would meet [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=569.52s)]
*  the challenge. They would try to create, quote, the ugliest art that we could think of. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=573.76s)]
*  So then they put up a new piece. It actually has that full White House quote on a plaque. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=580.64s)]
*  That plaque is on yet another new sculpture, I think deliberately designed to be as ugly as [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=588.8s)]
*  possible. It's got a gold spray painted ivy and a gold spray painted eagle and a gold spray painted [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=595.84s)]
*  TV. And in these images, it looks like the TV is off, but in situ, this sculpture actually [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=605.52s)]
*  has the TV playing stuff. The TV apparently is battery powered and it runs a constant loop of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=613.52s)]
*  video clips of Trump doing his signature dance where he looks like he's doing something rude [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=619.52s)]
*  with each hand. And these clips that play on a loop on this sculpture, they include a little [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=625.6s)]
*  squib of video of Trump kind of doing that dance at a party with the late millionaire pedophile, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=632.72s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein, to whom President Donald Trump was in fact a friend. Because for our sins, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=640.08s)]
*  with everything else going on, with Trump today restarting the total economic chaos [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=651.84s)]
*  of random scattershot tariffs on every country in the world other than Russia, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=658.96s)]
*  with the U.S. government in its infinite wisdom under Donald Trump getting us back into the measles [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=664.4s)]
*  business, which we had basically eradicated, but now we've got the biggest measles outbreak we've [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  had in more than 30 years, with President Trump saying he was, quote, not notified of the decision [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=674.4s)]
*  to cut off U.S. military support shipments to Ukraine. He said he was not notified and he [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=680.88s)]
*  issued no instruction to do that, raising the obvious question of, okay, then if you as [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  president didn't make that decision, who made that decision? With Trump literally paving the rose [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=692.24s)]
*  garden and putting this picture of himself up in the White House in the room with all the portraits [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=698.56s)]
*  of the first ladies, this is what he put up. In the middle of everything else large and small [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=705.92s)]
*  that we are contending with, there really is a Jeffrey Epstein Donald Trump subplot in our lives [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=713.04s)]
*  now in which this footage exists and in which the Trump Justice Department put out a statement today [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=719.52s)]
*  saying, never mind all the things we ever said and hyped and screamed about the late pedophile [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=730.32s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein. Turns out it's all nothing and people should stop asking us about it. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=736.24s)]
*  Headline. Trump administration acknowledges lack of evidence from Epstein documents. After months [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=742.96s)]
*  of promising big revelations, Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledges a lack of evidence for a host [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=749.6s)]
*  of conspiracy theories, including a quote, client list. Trump's attorney general Pam Bondi, in fact, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=755.12s)]
*  not only said there was a Jeffrey Epstein client list that Trump had ordered her to review and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=763.6s)]
*  release to the American people, she not only said there was a Jeffrey Epstein client list, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=770.08s)]
*  she said that she had it in her possession on her desk. One of the things that you alluded to, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=775.28s)]
*  and this is something Donald Trump has talked about, that DOJ may be releasing the list of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=783.84s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's clients. Will that really happen? It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=788.5600000000001s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that. I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=795.12s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the directive of the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=801.6s)]
*  president from all of these agencies. Oh yes, it was a directive of the president. The Epstein [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=805.12s)]
*  client list is sitting on my desk right now, says Donald Trump's handpicked attorney general. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=811.28s)]
*  New statement today from her department, the US Department of Justice, says there is no [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=818.8s)]
*  Epstein client list. The systematic review revealed no incriminating client list, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=826.4s)]
*  according to today's DOJ memo. These guys have been hyping the whole Epstein conspiracy theory [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=832.24s)]
*  for years. I mean, this is the guy who Donald Trump appointed to be deputy director of the FBI. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=840.8s)]
*  I've already told you the Epstein story. Let's just say a friend [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  who knows about something, if you've heard the story, was on the plane with Clinton, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=852.4s)]
*  Clinton with the Epstein thing, and he said, I'm out of here, Daddy-o. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=856.16s)]
*  I told that story quite a few times, so I know a lot about this story. There are a lot of people [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  who know old Jeff, a lot of people. So it's kind of weird, like this client list is about to come [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=866.24s)]
*  out. Everybody got quiet all of a sudden. I know a lot about this story. Says the podcaster, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=873.04s)]
*  who Trump named to be deputy director of the FBI. Now today, knock, knock, knock, FBI, what's up [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=884.24s)]
*  with that? Today, according to the FBI and the Justice Department, there is nothing at all to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=890.64s)]
*  this Jeffrey Epstein story. Please stop talking about it. There will be no further information [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=895.2s)]
*  released. Client list, what client list? We will not be talking about this anymore. There will be [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=899.5200000000001s)]
*  no further information. You should stop talking about this, except maybe if it is raised, you know, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=905.2800000000001s)]
*  on the gold spray painted television sculpture on the national mall. Maybe you could learn something [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  about it there, but otherwise, now that Donald Trump is the head of the US federal government, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=920.08s)]
*  we're just no. Trump administration today announced that on second thought, they are not [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=924.48s)]
*  going to fire 83,000 people who work at the Department of Veterans Affairs. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump appointed a Republican congressman to run the VA. He called the VA bloated and announced [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=943.28s)]
*  that it would need to be radically, radically reduced in size. He announced that tens of [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=950.16s)]
*  thousands of people were going to be fired, pounded his chest that there'd be more than [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  80,000 people fired from the VA. He put out a video saying, quote, we'll be making major changes, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=959.12s)]
*  so get used to it now. Now tonight, that's off. Apparently the Washington Post reporting tonight, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=965.4399999999999s)]
*  quote, the announcement marks a significant reversal for the Trump administration. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=971.6s)]
*  In recent days, we've also seen the Trump administration reverse course and say it's [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=975.52s)]
*  no longer going to knowingly declare dead people who it knows to be alive. They had done this to [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=981.12s)]
*  more than 6,000 people at the Social Security administration with plans to do it potentially [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=987.76s)]
*  to millions of people. Now they have reversed course on that and they will no longer declare [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=992.8s)]
*  people who are alive to legally be dead. They also reversed course on HIV prevention. Trump had [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=997.52s)]
*  ordered a halt for some reason to HIV prevention efforts all across the country because yeah, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  heaven forbid, we try to prevent people from getting HIV and AIDS, but they've had to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1012.64s)]
*  reverse that too, quote, following outcry. With this ongoing catastrophe in central Texas right [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1018.48s)]
*  now, just watch. They are going to have to reverse all they've done to try to destroy the National [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1026.48s)]
*  Weather Service and NOAA, they are going to have to figure out a way to reverse that. We'll, as I [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1033.2s)]
*  said, have more on that coming up later on this hour. This Trump presidency wants to be seen as [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1037.76s)]
*  fearsome, right? They want to be seen as powerful and scary. They want people to be afraid of them, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1044.8s)]
*  but what they really are in equal measure is awful and weird. And it's worth being afraid of that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  because it's weird and awful and scary to have somebody that weird and awful in charge of the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1059.9199999999998s)]
*  federal government, but it's not fearsome in the way they mean it to be. It's fearsome in the sense [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1065.84s)]
*  of like, oh my God, these people are in charge of what? I mean, Trump really did pardon the guy who [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1072.48s)]
*  bragged about pooping in the U.S. Capitol. And that footage of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1078.32s)]
*  is a real thing. And the bizarre thing with his Justice Department today and its pronouncement [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1083.2s)]
*  on the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories, what are we supposed to make of all that from these [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1087.9199999999998s)]
*  people? At the same time, he's got the military, the U.S. military deployed in Los Angeles, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  California. While the National Guard is now asking pleas for its troops back because among other [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1099.2s)]
*  things they need to prepare for wildfire season. But no, Trump today, for whatever reason, sent a [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1105.52s)]
*  small army of federal agents and National Guard troops in military vehicles and on horseback [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1110.16s)]
*  into a park in Los Angeles for a big, weird show of force that nobody can figure out. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1116.48s)]
*  There was kind of nobody in the park. They didn't seem to have any reason to be there, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1122.8s)]
*  but this is how they fanned out across a mostly empty MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, California [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1126.96s)]
*  today. What's that about? What are you doing? The president of the Los Angeles City Council [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1132.4s)]
*  telling reporters today, quote, looked like a staging for a TikTok video saying that if [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1140.16s)]
*  Border Patrol wants to film in Los Angeles, quote, you should apply for a film permit like [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1144.88s)]
*  everybody else and stop trying to scare the bejesus out of everybody who lives in this great city. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1149.0400000000002s)]
*  The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, showed up herself at MacArthur Park while Trump's [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1155.2s)]
*  agents were doing whatever they were doing there today, made them look all the more ridiculous with [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1160.96s)]
*  them masked up, dressed up like they're going to rappel out of helicopters into Fallujah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1166.88s)]
*  Here's the mayor in her light blue suit saying, guys, what's up here? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  She basically shooed them away and they left. Then she spoke to reporters about it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1175.04s)]
*  So I went to MacArthur Park because it is very important that the truth be told [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1182.96s)]
*  about what happened there. Now you can spin it any way you like, but in my opinion, it's a political [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1187.92s)]
*  agenda of provoking fear and terror. Frankly, it is outrageous and un-American that we have [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1194.16s)]
*  federal armed vehicles in our parks when nothing is going on in the parks. It's outrageous and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1202.72s)]
*  un-American that the federal government seized our state's national guard. It's outrageous and [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1211.04s)]
*  un-American that we have U.S. Marines who are trained to kill foreign soldiers overseas deployed [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1219.12s)]
*  in our American city. So here's the truth. There's no plan other than fear, chaos, and politics. Home [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1228.1599999999999s)]
*  depot one day, a car washed the next, armed vehicles and what looked like mounted military [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1238.16s)]
*  units in a park the next day. What happened to the criminals, the drug dealers, the violent [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1244.0s)]
*  individuals who were in the park today were children. It was their summer camp. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1253.92s)]
*  Why did Trump today send federal agents on horseback and in what looked like armored [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1260.96s)]
*  personnel carriers into a random California park hosting kids' summer camp? Why this use of federal [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1267.52s)]
*  government resources? Because it's a day that ends in Y under this president, which is why every [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1277.8400000000001s)]
*  weekend and every holiday and most days of the week now have Americans protesting against him [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1286.56s)]
*  in blue states and red states, in big cities and small towns. These were anti-Trump and anti-ice [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1292.56s)]
*  protests in Los Angeles over this holiday weekend before the weird photo op with the horses and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1299.12s)]
*  everything in MacArthur Park today. This was North Charleston, South Carolina protesting against Trump [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1304.8799999999999s)]

*  held a funeral for democracy. This was the protest against Trump this long holiday weekend in Louisville, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1330.16s)]
*  This was another one in Schaumburg, Illinois. This is one that happened this weekend, this long holiday [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1336.24s)]
*  weekend in Tustin, California. This is one that happened this long holiday weekend in San Diego, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  where the protest was led by U.S. military veterans. This was an anti-Trump, anti-ice protest in Omaha, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1346.88s)]
*  Nebraska. This was Medina, Ohio, where they held what they called a celebratory protest against [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1354.0800000000002s)]
*  This was Medina, Ohio, where they held what they called a celebrate America rally, celebrate America [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1362.0800000000002s)]

*  and what he's doing to immigrants. This was Kingston, New York, tyranny is at our door. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1377.1200000000001s)]
*  This was Buffalo, New York, and Niagara Falls, New York, two of more than two dozen protests that [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1384.24s)]
*  were held this weekend on the American side of the Canadian border for American citizens to show [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1390.64s)]
*  solidarity and friendship with Canada, with Canadians. Protests this weekend along those [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1396.64s)]
*  lines from Alaska all the way to Maine. In Leavenworth, Kansas, people have been organizing [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1402.3200000000002s)]
*  there against efforts to open a private immigration prison in that town, city of Leavenworth, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1411.2s)]
*  and its population is trying to stop it. In rural Louisiana, people have been protesting at [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1416.4s)]
*  the big immigration prisons in Gina, Louisiana, and Basile against Trump treating those places [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1421.92s)]
*  in Louisiana as if they are domestic black site prisons. In Burlington, Vermont, people are trying [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1427.6000000000001s)]
*  to get the airport there, the biggest airport in Vermont, trying to get the airport there to stop [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  cooperating with ICE for immigrant prison flights. And locals in Vermont have built public spreadsheets [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1438.3200000000002s)]
*  to track the names and all the information they can find about people who are being stashed in [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1445.6s)]
*  jails and prisons and immigration detention facilities in their state so local Vermonters [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1450.7199999999998s)]

*  not just protest, it is yielding protest everywhere, all the time, every day of the week, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1466.56s)]
*  but it's also yielding increasingly creative ways to try to stop them in their tracks. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1472.08s)]
*  They want to seem fearsome. They want to seem powerful. They are more often weird and [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1478.4s)]
*  incompetent, and when you push back on them, they cave. The more than creative efforts to stop them [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1485.2s)]
*  now today include a spectacular revelation in court, a revelation that very well may upend the [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1492.72s)]
*  Trump administration's plans to try to build out an international gulag of foreign prisons. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1500.72s)]
*  This was a surprise revelation that happened today. The lawyer who found it is going to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1506.48s)]
*  join us here live next. This is an interesting story. You're going to want to see it. Stay with us. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1511.28s)]
*  Judge, quote, the real question for the defendants is what they're going to do if he's released from [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1522.16s)]
*  criminal custody on July 16th. Trump administration lawyer, you want me to tell you the plan for him? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1526.72s)]
*  Judge, please. Please tell me the plan. Today there was a federal court hearing in Maryland [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1533.92s)]
*  where a judge is hearing a case about the bizarre bungled, seemingly lawless deportation [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1542.56s)]
*  of a man named Kilmar Abrego Garcia. This Maryland man who was sent to El Salvador became a nationally [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  recognized case. Today the judge became just totally exasperated by the Trump lawyer, Trump [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1554.88s)]
*  administration lawyers, just refusing to give her clear answers to her clear questions. And the judge [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1562.88s)]
*  just basically took the Trump administration lawyers apart in her courtroom today. Lawfare's [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  Anna Bauer was there in court for today's proceedings, and she had this reporting from [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1576.48s)]
*  the courtroom. The judge, what will you do if he's released on July 16th? Trump administration [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1581.52s)]
*  lawyer. The government has two options. First, it could remove him to a third country. Second, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1587.44s)]
*  it could see to dissolve his withholding of removal to El Salvador. The judge, okay, but [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1591.92s)]
*  what are you going to do? Trump Justice Department lawyer. That will be assessed when or if he's [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1596.8799999999999s)]
*  released. Assuming he is released, the current plan is to attempt to remove him to a third country. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1602.24s)]
*  It's possible, however, that DOJ could reassess that and seek to dissolve his withholding of [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1607.36s)]
*  removal. The judge, I don't buy for a second that you don't know what you're going to do. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1612.24s)]
*  Trump administration lawyer. I said that the plan currently is third country removal, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1618.4799999999998s)]
*  but I'm not prepared to say that option number two is ruled out. The judge, okay, what third country? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1623.76s)]
*  Trump administration lawyer. I don't know. There are a number of countries that we have [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  treaties and agreements with, and Homeland Security will assess options closer to time of release. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1635.92s)]
*  The judge, have you started the process of identifying a third country? At this point, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1642.0800000000002s)]
*  another Trump administration lawyer pipes up to say, I don't have that information. The judge, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1646.8000000000002s)]
*  have you asked that question? Trump administration lawyer. Quote, I haven't. It's hard for an agency [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1652.3200000000002s)]
*  to process someone if they don't have them in custody. Anna Bauer then reports in response to [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1658.72s)]
*  this. The judge is basically like, huh? Huh? Can't you answer any of my questions about what you're [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1665.84s)]
*  doing here? The lawyers for the Trump administration today refuse to provide straightforward answers to [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1675.28s)]
*  very straightforward questions from that judge. And although the Trump administration made it [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1682.1599999999999s)]
*  clear today that they would very much like to deport Kilmara Braco-Garcia again, for now, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1685.6799999999998s)]
*  he is here in the United States. He is no longer being held at El Salvador's notorious [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1691.52s)]
*  SICOT terrorism prison where he was sent earlier this year. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1695.92s)]
*  And yet the Trump administration has sent hundreds of other people to that prison in El Salvador. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1701.36s)]
*  And the administration keeps insisting in court that it has no control over any of the men who [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1706.48s)]
*  are being held there. It keeps saying, yes, we may have sent these people to El Salvador under [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1712.08s)]
*  circumstances that we can't justify, but too bad they're there now. They're totally out of our [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1716.24s)]
*  control. The administration has claimed it's impossible to return any of those individuals [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1720.72s)]
*  because they're no longer under U.S. government control. They're under control of the government [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1725.3600000000001s)]
*  of El Salvador. El Salvador has authority over them and they're a sovereign country. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1729.6000000000001s)]
*  That has been the Trump administration line over and over again. But today, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1733.92s)]
*  a major development happened on that front. In a new filing in federal court in Washington, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1737.44s)]
*  the country of El Salvador has apparently contradicted the Trump administration's claims [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1744.24s)]
*  on that. This filing was submitted by lawyers for men who are being held in that prison [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1748.56s)]
*  in El Salvador. And the filing says, quote, the government of El Salvador recently told [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1752.96s)]
*  the United Nations that it bears no legal responsibility for the men. The document, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1757.44s)]
*  written in response to a U.N. inquiry examining some of the deportations, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1762.8s)]
*  claimed that the Salvadoran government was merely doing the United States bidding [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1766.32s)]
*  when it accepted the men into its prison system. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1770.8s)]
*  ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt is lead counsel in this case. He says, quote, El Salvador has confirmed [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1773.92s)]
*  what we and everybody else understood. It's the United States that controls what happens [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1783.04s)]
*  to the men languishing at CCOT. Remarkably, the U.S. government did not provide this information [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  to us or to the court. Joining us now is Lee Gelernt. He's deputy director of the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1793.92s)]
*  immigrant rights project at the ACLU. He's lead counsel in this case against the Trump [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1799.52s)]
*  administration. Mr. Gelernt, it's nice to see you. Thank you for being here. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1803.6s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1807.04s)]
*  So I'm not a lawyer, but as a lay person, I feel like one of the things that I have absorbed here [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  in this whole bizarre saga is that the Trump administration wants to send people from this [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1814.0s)]
*  country to a prison in a foreign country. And then by virtue of the fact that those people [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1820.72s)]
*  are in a prison in a foreign country, it wants to disclaim all responsibility for them, say they [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1825.52s)]
*  can't be reached within the U.S. law and they certainly can't be returned to this country [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1830.72s)]
*  for any reason. It would appear that you have now discovered something that gives lie to that entire [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1836.16s)]
*  line of reasoning and line of argument to the courts from the Trump administration. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1843.36s)]
*  Is that a fair interpretation? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1847.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely fair. And I want to thank our friends at Human Rights First, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1849.76s)]
*  who wrote the UN and were able to secure this document and give it to us for our court case. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1854.08s)]
*  This is a remarkable turn of events, I think, in two respects. One is that the United States [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1861.04s)]
*  government has told every court, district court, court of appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1867.12s)]
*  we don't have legal responsibility for these men. El Salvador does. And therefore, they need to [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1872.96s)]
*  continue languishing there. And as you put it, essentially, what's a gulag sent there without [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1878.0s)]
*  any due process, the men overwhelmingly dispute that they're members of gangs. But yet we're never [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1883.2s)]
*  given a chance to show that. They're sitting in there and the United States government says, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1888.4s)]
*  we don't have legal responsibility. This document from the government of El Salvador says, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1893.04s)]
*  no, it's the United States that has legal responsibility, the direct opposite of what [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1897.8400000000001s)]
*  the United States government is telling our courts. The second thing that's remarkable is what you [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1903.2s)]
*  also said, Rachel, is for three months, the government has the United States has been in [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1907.68s)]
*  possession of this document, never gave it to us, never gave it to the court despite a discovery [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1912.5600000000002s)]
*  request. And so the court is making decisions without full information. Unfortunately, it's [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1919.1200000000001s)]
*  par for the course for this administration. So it's shocking, but not surprising that the [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1926.5600000000002s)]
*  document was not turned over to us or the court. So if at baseline, this is the El Salvador, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1932.48s)]
*  the Salvadoran government admitting and putting in writing and declaring formally that people who [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1939.52s)]
*  are being held in this prison, who were sent there by the U.S. government are in control of the U.S. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1946.24s)]
*  government and therefore the U.S. government is able to decide their fate. If that's the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1950.56s)]
*  implication of this document and the U.S. government knew that El Salvador has declared that [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1956.72s)]
*  and knew that this document existed and refused to hand it over to the court when the court [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1965.3600000000001s)]
*  expected to see anything along these lines, isn't that a problem not just for the Trump [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1969.8400000000001s)]
*  administration in terms of making this argument? Isn't that a problem for these Justice Department [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1976.24s)]
*  lawyers who have been defending the government's actions here in terms of their duty of candor [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1980.16s)]
*  to the court, their responsibility to hand over documents that are demanded [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1986.0s)]
*  in the course of these proceedings? Yeah. So you're hitting on a lot of big issues. I mean, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1990.4s)]
*  one thing we're going to have to see is whether the government lawyers knew about the document, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=1996.16s)]
*  because one thing I've seen standing up in court against the Trump administration [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2001.04s)]
*  all these days, you know, over the last three, four months, is that often the lawyers are not [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2005.12s)]
*  told information precisely so they can have plausible deniability. So we'll have to see what [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2011.04s)]
*  the government lawyers themselves knew, but there's no question the United States knew about this [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2017.52s)]
*  document. And from our standpoint, I mean, you're absolutely right to focus on that issue, but from [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2022.48s)]
*  our standpoint right now, we're focused on trying to get these men back. I don't want to be cynical, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2026.6399999999999s)]
*  but I suspect the Trump administration is going to say that that was a mistake. The Salvadoran [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2031.92s)]
*  government made a mistake in saying that, and now it's been all cleared up and the United States [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2036.48s)]
*  doesn't have legal responsibility. That would be an ex post whitewashing of this. We'll see what they [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2043.04s)]
*  say, what the court, how the courts react, and we'll also see what the lawyers knew about it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2049.28s)]
*  But this is a remarkable turn of events because these men have been sitting there in horrendous [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2054.48s)]
*  conditions, never having had a chance to show that they're not gang members in one of the worst [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2060.64s)]
*  prisons in the world. We're going on four months now, and the United States has had this document [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2066.4s)]
*  now for, we think, three months. Yeah, and what the document says is that the U.S. government is [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2071.6s)]
*  responsible for the fate of those men, and so it's a moral responsibility as well as a legal [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2077.04s)]
*  responsibility here that's on all of us. This is a remarkable development, and this is presumably [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2081.76s)]
*  going to have some really important repercussions in terms of these cases. We look forward to [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2087.6s)]
*  staying in touch with you about it, Lee. Thank you. Thanks, Rachel. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2092.96s)]
*  Lake Learn is deputy director for the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project. All right, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2096.96s)]
*  we got more news here ahead. Stay with us. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2101.36s)]
*  The death toll from the catastrophic flooding in central Texas has now reached [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2108.88s)]
*  104 lives lost. That includes at least 28 kids, many of them girls who've been staying at [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2112.48s)]
*  a summer camp along the Guadalupe River. Search and rescue efforts are ongoing tonight in central [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2120.4s)]
*  Texas. About five million people were still under flood watch as of about an hour ago tonight. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2126.72s)]
*  Part of recovering from this historic and horrifying disaster is, of course, understanding [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2133.04s)]

*  busy hurricane season. This was May of this year from KEYE in Austin. Warnings, fears of impacts [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2152.56s)]
*  of staffing cuts at National Weather Service. This was from even earlier, from April from KXAN in [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2161.04s)]
*  Austin. Head of local weather warnings takes early retirement as NOAA cuts continue. That one's about [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2168.16s)]
*  the person in charge of coordinating weather warnings at the local offices of the National [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2175.36s)]
*  Weather Service for this region where the floods just happened. He was a 32-year veteran of the job. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2179.92s)]
*  He took early retirement because the Trump administration pushed through its inexplicable [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2184.8s)]
*  austerity regime at agencies that indeed included the National Weather Service and NOAA. Again, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2190.8s)]
*  this is Austin station KXAN. Quote, the importance of experience in the warning coordination [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2196.56s)]
*  meteorologist role cannot be overstated. Ensuring ample and timely warning to the central Texas [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2202.96s)]

*  under the Trump administration may make filling that role more challenging. All of that reporting [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2216.56s)]
*  coming before disaster struck in the Texas Hill Country in the pre-dawn hours of July 4th. Given [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  how quickly that flooding situation escalated with the water rising 20 or 30 feet in the matter of [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2230.0s)]
*  an hour in some cases. It may be of some comfort to hear former officials from the National Weather [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2236.72s)]
*  Service saying the forecasts ahead of the storm may have been as good as could be expected. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2242.8s)]
*  But as the New York Times reports today, beyond the vacancies at the regional offices, beyond the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2249.44s)]
*  number of vacant positions, Texas also faced the loss of experienced people who would typically [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2253.76s)]
*  have helped communicate with local authorities in the hours after flash flood warnings were issued [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2259.84s)]
*  overnight. Like say, for example, the warning coordination meteorologist with decades of experience [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2265.04s)]
*  who left that exact job in that exact place in the middle of the onslaught against government [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2273.44s)]
*  agencies led by Donald Trump and Doge. There are real consequences to this president's efforts [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2280.4s)]
*  to dismantle the U.S. government. It's not just about ideology. It is about lives. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2289.2s)]
*  One very smart person with really relevant experience in the field joins us here live next. Stay with us. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2295.7599999999998s)]
*  Joining us now is Eric Holthaus. He's a meteorologist and the founder of Currently [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2305.68s)]
*  Weather Service. He's been doing some frankly harrowing reporting on the collision of budget [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2309.6s)]
*  cuts and climate change and science for the Guardian newspaper. His latest article for [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2314.16s)]
*  The Guardian is titled Texas Floods Reveal Limitations of Disaster Forecasting Under Climate Crisis. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2318.4s)]
*  Mr. Holthaus, thank you very much for joining us. I really appreciate it. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2325.36s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much. It's a real honor to be here. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2328.64s)]
*  The rescue and recovery operations in Texas are still underway. It is heartbreaking. It's also, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  I think, increasingly infuriating that we're in this situation. Is it fair to say that we are [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2338.64s)]
*  taking action as a country to basically lessen our readiness, to lessen our ability to protect [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2344.56s)]
*  people and warn people in the face of this kind of disaster? Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2350.32s)]
*  that's exactly right. I think that what the Trump administration has been doing is systematically [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2355.44s)]
*  undercutting science. I mean, let's take a step back here. We are in the middle of the [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2362.48s)]
*  most severe problem our species has ever faced in climate change, and that problem is accelerating. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2370.0s)]
*  Emissions are accelerating, and this administration has really decided to just say, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2377.44s)]
*  no, we're not going to pay attention to that, and we'll hope that everyone can, you know, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2383.2s)]
*  fend for themselves. And it's really, really infuriating. As someone who's been covering [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2387.12s)]
*  this beat for 20 years now, I have little kids, you know, like I wake up at night and am just [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2392.48s)]
*  worried for, you know, where's the next flood going to be? We haven't entered hurricane season [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2400.88s)]
*  yet, and it's just, it's going to be bad, and it's heartbreaking. I feel like one of the things that [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2408.4s)]
*  we've all had to learn in these last few years is that climate change means climate chaos, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2415.84s)]
*  it means weather chaos, and it means unpredictability when it comes to dealing [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2421.68s)]
*  with severe weather events of all kinds. One of the things that I think we're looking [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2425.8399999999997s)]
*  to science for right now in terms of resilience is to try to increase predictability, to try to [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2431.52s)]
*  increase what we understand about how weather goes haywire in this type of climate crisis that we're [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2437.44s)]
*  in. Is that the kind of science that is being abandoned or turned off by this administration? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2443.68s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's one thing with the National Weather Service cut. So, you know, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2451.44s)]
*  the Austin San Antonio office, which has responsibility for for Kirk County in this case, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2457.28s)]
*  was missing its warning coordination meteorologist, as you outlined, and that is the [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2463.92s)]
*  person who coordinates with emergency officials as a representative of meteorologists employed by the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2468.48s)]
*  federal government to manage that disaster. And yes, they had enough people on hand during the [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2475.36s)]
*  storm to cover that role, but as you said, you lost someone with decades of experience for no reason. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2482.32s)]
*  And systematically now throughout the administration, you know, as we're going [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2490.08s)]
*  through this budget process the last couple months, the parts of NOAA, parts of the parent [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2495.36s)]
*  of the National Weather Service that have been cut, most are the researchers. So the people that [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2501.84s)]
*  are working to make our science, moving it forward, those positions are being cut. You know, the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2506.0800000000004s)]
*  Environmental Modeling Center, which is based in Maryland, their only job is to improve the weather [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  models that every single person in the United States, every weather app, and anytime you get a [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2517.6000000000004s)]
*  weather forecast, these are the models that that forecast comes from, and those people have been [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2523.0400000000004s)]
*  fired. And it's just like, I don't really understand any reason for that other than [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2529.36s)]
*  this idea that, you know, if you stop predicting something, then it won't happen, which obviously [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2537.04s)]
*  is a fairy tale. Wow, yeah, it doesn't even count as magic. It'd be bad magic to even try that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2542.56s)]
*  Eric Holthaus, founder and chief meteorologist at Currently Weather Service, thank you for being [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2549.76s)]
*  with us again in the midst of this still ongoing disaster. We look forward to having you back to [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2553.76s)]
*  talk about this more in the future, Eric. Thanks. Thank you so much. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2559.28s)]
*  All right, that's going to do it for me tonight. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_CkHqvfnHQ&t=2562.32s)]
