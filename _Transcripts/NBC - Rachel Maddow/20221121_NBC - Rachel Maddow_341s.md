# Co-Owners Of Club Q Discuss Aftermath Of Mass Shooting
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE)
*  Joining us now are Matthew Haynes and Nick Grzecha. They are the co-owners of Club Q, where this mass shooting happened. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Haynes, Mr. Grzecha, I am so sorry for what you have been through. Thank you for being willing to be with us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=16.56s)]
*  Let me just ask you first, I've tried to summarize the basics of what we know about what happened and what we've been told by officials. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=17.36s)]
*  Is there anything that I've gotten wrong or anything else that you can add to us that you think the country should know tonight about what happened and what the response was like once this horrible incident got underway? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=25.36s)]
*  I think what people need to remember the most are the innocent victims. They're no longer with us tonight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=37.92s)]
*  The 18 people that were injured, the countless more people that have trauma injuries, that's what I think everybody, that's the biggest part tonight is memorandum. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=46.72s)]
*  Absolutely. That's what we see behind us. That's what we see. I will add that we've had tremendous community support. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=58.4s)]
*  We've had tremendous support from the local Colorado Springs Police Department. We've had tremendous support from the mayor and all of the state officials. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=67.52s)]
*  So we couldn't have asked for more support. The reaction that night was outstanding. We had so many police officers. We had such a response. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=76.48s)]
*  We've had a very good history with Colorado Springs Police over the years and it just really shone that particular night, that tragic night. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=90.0s)]
*  They were wonderful. They were their mother employees, their family. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=108.72s)]
*  They were the heart of what Club Q is. They are what most of our customers would have had experience. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=113.92s)]
*  They both were incredibly passionate. They worked amazingly well together. They were great friends. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=124.72s)]
*  These are our true family members. They're the Nick and I's family members and so many people behind us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=133.2s)]
*  They've changed so many lives that they've changed. I cannot do their memory justice when you look on their Facebook pages and you look at what everyone else and all the individual experiences people have had with these two wonderful men. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=140.24s)]
*  It tells an amazing story. It's what the last 20 years of Club Q has been about. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=155.2s)]
*  They embody what this type of bar is, what a community bar is and what community really is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=163.36s)]
*  They were amazing. I wanted to say a lot of what we're learning as the country learns of this story and learns more about Club Q and learns about what happened on Saturday night. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=173.6s)]
*  I think one of the things that people are really struck by is that all sorts of different people were there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=184.16s)]
*  Definitely, you know, gay people there, queer people there, transgender people there, also straight people there with their families, people in multi-generational groups enjoying the show. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  It just felt like the most diverse, imaginable group of people there and people who have come out in support of what happened there tonight. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=200.8s)]
*  I wondered if you could speak to that a little bit, especially given how much political hate has been directed at the queer community and particularly at the trans community over these past couple of years from the political right. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  That is what Club Q is. That is what a queer space is. It's a space that all of these people can gather together without hate, without prejudice. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=226.72s)]
*  To feel safe. That's every night at Club Q. It's every night at every queer bar across the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=240.72s)]
*  That's the devastating thing is this community has now lost their space, but the community that they've built inside that space can't be taken away. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  We talk about hate, but for all the hate, there is still so much love. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=259.76s)]
*  And that's what we've had in this bar. And that's what the Saturday night was a representation of what every night is there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=265.52s)]
*  It is full of a community of people. And when I say community, I don't mean just gay people. It's all of the allies. It's all of the people and all of the support we have. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=274.16s)]
*  This is 2022 after all, and we have come a long way than where we started 20 years ago here, building this business. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=283.68s)]
*  And so there's a lot of victories we've all had, and we do receive so much support from so many walks of life. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=292.64s)]
*  Matthew Haynes, Nick, or Zecha, the co-owners of Club Q in Colorado Springs, thank you for being with us. I know it's an incredibly difficult time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you being here tonight. Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=310.08s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaolAB-YdzE&t=313.52s)]
