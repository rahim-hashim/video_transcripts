# 'It's the only way': More Republicans back Harris with goal of purging Trump to save the GOP
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k)
*  Good morning Bangor, Maine, the Queen City, home to 30,000 people and important and super [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=0.0s)]
*  cute international airport, a fittingly large statue of Paul Bunyan. And as of this morning's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=6.5s)]
*  paper, a new center of no from Republicans who do not want the Republican presidential [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=13.4s)]
*  nominee Donald Trump to be president again. As headlined in the Bangor Daily News, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=20.96s)]
*  We chair the main Republican party. We endorse Kamala Harris for president. This op-ed today [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=26.6s)]
*  was written by three different former chairs of the main Republican party. Quote, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=31.94s)]
*  We led our party at a time when candidates of both parties were not only civil and believed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=38.28s)]
*  in the rule of law, but we believe had the best interests of the state and entire nation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  foremost in their hearts, even when we disagreed on policies. We see these same positive characteristics [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  are on full display in vice president Harris and her candidacy. Sadly, they are completely lacking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=52.8s)]
*  in her opponent, former president Donald Trump. Quote, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=59.099999999999994s)]
*  Much of the leadership of today's Republican party has joined to the cult of Trump. We know [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=62.08s)]
*  that they will care little for what we have to say. But we also know that the Republican party [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=66.36s)]
*  in Maine is still home to many honest, hardworking, principled people who, more than any party label, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=71.2s)]
*  want what is best for our state and nation. We hope that they will join us in supporting Harris for president. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=78.68s)]
*  Joining us now is Ted O'Mara, one of those former chairs who endorsed Vice President Harris today. Mr. O'Mara, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=84.72s)]
*  I really appreciate you taking the time. Thanks very much for being here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=90.48s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Rachel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=93.72s)]
*  So what went into this decision for you and these other two former state Republican party chairman? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  I think it was an easy decision for us. You know, as the op-ed states, we all led the party in a different time and place when it was truly a big tent and when it stood for personal liberty and a clean environment and physical concern, you know, and physical responsibility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=102.84s)]
*  And today it has become a cult that really has no principles and believes whatever dear leader has to say on any given day. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=121.72s)]
*  Liz Cheney spoke a couple of days ago about the prospect that the Republican Party may have sort of run out its lease on credibility by sticking with Donald Trump for three consecutive election cycles and that the Republican Party may, if it can't fundamentally reinvent itself, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=133.84s)]
*  in a post Trump way that the party may need to go out of business. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=152.68s)]
*  And some other governing, responsible, conservative party may need to build itself from scratch in the United States. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=157.24s)]
*  I wonder your thoughts on that, having had a leadership role yourself in your state. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=165.6s)]
*  Maybe she's right, but I still think the basic foundation is there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=171.2s)]
*  I mean, we are the party of Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and here in Maine, Margaret Chase Smith and Olympia Snow and Bill Colman. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  And that foundation, I think, is still there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=183.28s)]
*  And but I think we have to end Donald Trump's reign before that party can can rebuild. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, all of us who once led the party and many of us who, like me, have left the party, none of us rushed out to become Democrats. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  But we left the Republican Party because it no longer stood for the things that we believed in and it no longer stood for the things that the party has always stood for. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=204.16s)]
*  So and also, Rachel, I think over the last decade or so, just the constant chaos and insanity that we've been put through, we have to put an end to it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=214.48s)]
*  And the only way to do that is to get behind Vice President Harris and Tim Walz and join them in a new way forward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=225.96s)]
*  That's the only way the Republican Party or any other alternative party is is is going to be able to to emerge. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=233.92s)]
*  You and your your fellow former state party, State Republican Party chairman, you closed this op ed today by saying this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=243.88s)]
*  Former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan, a Republican, put it best in his speech to the Democratic Convention last month when he said, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=252.04s)]
*  Let me be clear to my Republican friends at home. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=258.88s)]
*  If you vote for Kamala Harris in 2024, you're not a Democrat. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=261.52s)]
*  You're a patriot. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=266.2s)]
*  And then you close your op ed by saying on November 5th, be a patriot. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=267.4s)]
*  I just wanted to ask what your I mean, as somebody who spent a long time as a political professional and supported lots of campaigns and a lot of thinking about strategy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=271.36s)]
*  What do you think the impact is of former Republicans like yourself, Mr. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=280.48s)]
*  Duncan in Georgia, people like Vice President Cheney, Liz Cheney and so many other Republicans, former Republican, former Reagan administration officials, former Trump administration officials, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  so many Republicans coming out and saying it's patriotic to vote for Harris. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=297.68s)]
*  What do you think will be the strategic impact of that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=302.0s)]
*  I hope it helps people feel that it's OK to join us, that putting your state and your country and your family before any party label is the most important thing you can do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=305.4s)]
*  You know, as the op ed talked about, there are many good, hardworking, principled people out there that still consider themselves Republican. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  And we hope that this is going to be a close election. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=330.44s)]
*  And if we can encourage just a few people to come along with us and to say it's OK this time to vote for a Democratic candidate because it's what's in the best interest of our state and our nation and our families. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  I hope we can persuade a few people that that is OK to join us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=349.2s)]
*  Ted O'Mara, former Maine Republican Party chairman, sir, thank you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  Really appreciate you being here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=358.67999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, Richard. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4zRrdFq20k&t=359.96s)]
