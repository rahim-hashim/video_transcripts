# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 16
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI)
*  This is what you might call an ongoing problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, pick your decade, pick your state, pick your degree of notoriety or obscurity. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=4.08s)]
*  It's the same thing over and over and over again from the far right in the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=10.0s)]
*  And it swings back and forth from terroristic violence and murder to electoral politics [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=15.8s)]
*  to fantasies about racial purity to conspiracies about the Jews to disgust for democracy and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=22.28s)]
*  a desire, sometimes an effort, to take and hold power by force, by force of arms, instead [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=29.16s)]
*  of through our democratic force of government. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=34.72s)]
*  It keeps coming up. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=37.76s)]
*  This is a recurring thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=39.04s)]
*  A justification and a call for violence based on this insane, paranoic fantasy that white [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=40.84s)]
*  people are an endangered species as long as there are non-white people around. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=47.32s)]
*  And any change in the ratio of white people to other people is a sure sign that the global [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=51.96s)]
*  plot to eliminate the white race is approaching its goal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=56.0s)]
*  And so white people need to buy guns and stand up and take our country back and make it great [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=59.6s)]
*  again, because otherwise white people are being replaced. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=64.6s)]
*  And this weekend, it was 10 people killed in Buffalo, almost all of them elderly African [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=71.12s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  And the shooter decorated his gun with the N-word and the 14-word slogan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=77.28s)]
*  And he posted his online manifesto about how white people are so endangered, how they're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=83.06s)]
*  being replaced. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=87.14s)]
*  And in August 2019, it was the shooting that killed 23 people, mostly Latinos, at a Walmart [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=90.14s)]
*  in El Paso, Texas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=95.7s)]
*  And in that case, that guy too posted his online manifesto about how white people are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=97.26s)]
*  so endangered and how they're being replaced. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=101.7s)]
*  And before that, it was April 2019. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=104.56s)]
*  It was the killing in the synagogue in Poway, California, where the killer also posted his [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=106.34s)]
*  online manifesto about how white people are so endangered, how they're being replaced. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=111.24s)]
*  And before that, it was March 2019. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=116.08s)]
*  It was the guy in Christchurch, New Zealand, who killed 51 people in two different mosques. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=118.16s)]
*  And he posted his online manifesto about how white people are so endangered and how they're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=122.96s)]
*  being replaced. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=127.12s)]
*  And before that, it was October 2018. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=128.32s)]
*  It was 11 people killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=131.0s)]
*  shooter there posting all over right-wing social media sites about how white people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=135.2s)]
*  are so endangered, about how they're being replaced. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=139.26s)]
*  And before that, it was August 2017. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=141.9s)]
*  Those very fine people the former president talked about marching with tiki torches at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=144.26s)]
*  Charlottesville, Virginia, a show of force, a white male phalanx, shouting to the cameras [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=148.5s)]
*  as they marched about how white people are so endangered, how white people are being [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=153.38s)]
*  replaced. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=157.62s)]
*  You will not replace us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=159.98s)]
*  Jews will not replace us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=161.26s)]
*  It is not a new concept. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=165.3s)]
*  It's not even a new pretext, a new justification for violent racist terrorism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=168.66s)]
*  It has long been so. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=174.78s)]
*  It is right now being newly popularized, newly mainstreamed by the biggest names in conservative [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=177.46s)]
*  media and even by the leadership of the Republican Party in Congress. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=182.14s)]
*  But it is an old idea. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  It is an old and stupid idea. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=189.1s)]
*  It is an old and stupid and dangerous idea, old, stupid and dangerous and equal measure. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=191.34s)]
*  But now what do we do? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=197.6s)]
*  Because there's a reason these white men keep killing black people and Jews and Latinos [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=199.62s)]
*  and Muslims in the largest numbers they can. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=205.4s)]
*  And it is not just because they believe in this ideology and are inspired by it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  They are. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what's leading them to kill all these people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  But beyond that, they keep doing this the way they're doing it because they're not [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  only adherents of that ideology, they are evangelists for it as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=222.04s)]
*  They want to spread this ideology to others. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=226.82s)]
*  They want to make it famous. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=229.26s)]
*  They want to make it popular. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=231.76s)]
*  They want more white people to understand this concept and think this way and act like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=233.6s)]
*  them because of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=238.68s)]
*  That's why they all post these stupid manifestos online, these explanations of the supposed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=240.66s)]
*  reasons for their murders. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  So we all have to learn about their asinine, sophomoric, puerile, soft-headed, pitiful [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=248.2s)]
*  little old theories. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=253.26s)]
*  So we all have to take time to learn it, to understand it, to talk about it so we can [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=255.78s)]
*  explain and understand why all those poor beautiful little old ladies in Buffalo this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=259.22s)]
*  weekend had to be murdered with an assault rifle while they were doing their grocery [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=267.32s)]
*  shopping. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=270.48s)]
*  I mean, what do you do? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=271.48s)]
*  It doesn't help to pretend we don't know the motive for these repeated, terroristic mass [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=274.8s)]
*  murders. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=282.72s)]
*  They're part of a terrorist movement that is both murderous and seditious and has a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  very long history in this country, one that is surging anew in terms of its mainstream [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=289.26000000000005s)]
*  influence right now in our media and politics. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  Seeing that movement for what it is, seeing where it's taking hold and who's aiding and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=298.42s)]
*  abetting it, that's valuable, if only for trying to head off the next inevitable one [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=302.26000000000005s)]
*  of these murderous attacks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  Ignoring why these guys are doing what they're doing and what they're citing as the pretextual [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=307.74s)]
*  justification for their actions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=312.4s)]
*  I mean, it only excuses, for example, the conservative politicians and conservative [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=315.04s)]
*  TV shows that continue to spread this intellectual diarrhea despite the death toll it has already [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=319.6s)]
*  racked up in all of these attacks. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=324.8s)]
*  But it is nauseating, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=327.94s)]
*  I mean, it is, to me at least, it is nauseating to be talking about their ideas at all, to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=333.0s)]
*  be talking about the murderous fantasies they all share that they hope will inspire more [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  killing, more attacks, more terrorism, if only they can just spread the word to enough [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  white people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=350.02s)]
*  This is a problem not just about murder and violence, but about information. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  It is about finding a way to learn what's going on, learning enough to be sharp and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=357.94s)]
*  real about what's happening online and what's happening in right-wing politics to activate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=363.06s)]
*  these kinds of killers, while also in so doing, not helping them spread the word, not helping [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=366.96s)]
*  them spread these ideas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=372.52s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=375.32s)]
*  How do we do it right now? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Today in the wake of the Buffalo murders. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=381.44s)]
*  How do we do it every day from here on out? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=383.64s)]
*  Joining us now is Ben Collins. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=388.12s)]
*  He's an NBC News reporter who covers disinformation, extremism and the internet. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=389.12s)]
*  Ben, I'm really glad you were able to be here tonight. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=396.91999999999996s)]
*  So you cover disinformation and extremism for a living. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  I just want to ask you bluntly, and it's okay if the answer here is no. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=402.64s)]
*  Is the tension that I'm feeling here real and warranted, this tension between understanding [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=407.08s)]
*  the extremism that's at work here while also desiring not to spread it, not to popularize [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  it? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=418.2s)]
*  It's a very real tension, and it's something that I fight with personally while doing this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=419.2s)]
*  job. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=423.44s)]
*  I did all Saturday. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=424.46s)]
*  I was thinking, how do I make sure people understand what's in this manifesto and also [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=425.46s)]
*  understand mostly that this man is not alone in thinking this, that he's part of a community [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=429.9s)]
*  of people who want to murder people without trying to spread that message. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=435.1s)]
*  And it's really difficult. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=440.1s)]
*  You know, I spent the last day or two just looking through his Discord chats that he [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=441.1s)]
*  has posted to, you know, like a diary since December. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=446.42s)]
*  It's incredibly and deeply chilling. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=453.52s)]
*  The idea that he had was, you know, he was going to go to the supermarket instead of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=456.72s)]
*  a church or a school, which he thought about. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  He thought about going to a school down the street because he deduced that there were [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=463.8s)]
*  more Black children in that school because he thought they didn't test as well. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  That's how racist this man was. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=472.44s)]
*  But he decided instead to go to the supermarket because he wanted to make sure every Black [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=475.48s)]
*  person feared for their life everywhere they went. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=481.06s)]
*  And I don't really know how to say that to people without quoting him in that way. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=484.5s)]
*  But it is the tension that we have and just avoiding it now or, you know, taking those [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=490.5s)]
*  ideas that he has and try to moderate them a little bit, which is what, you know, frankly, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=499.1s)]
*  Tucker Carlson tries to do. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=504.38s)]
*  That's irresponsible. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=507.22s)]
*  I don't have solutions for this. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=508.9s)]
*  I think people have talked today about banning 4chan or something or, you know, blaming [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=510.36s)]
*  Twitch. And that's fine. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=515.28s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=517.72s)]
*  If you were to ban 4chan, these people would use a VPN and get around it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=519.84s)]
*  There's a website that is based in Japan. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=523.12s)]
*  There's not a lot of jurisdiction there for us. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=525.96s)]
*  People will find a way to get to 4chan. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=527.84s)]
*  They want to get to 4chan. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  There is a civic responsibility, though, to not take their ideas and take the murder out [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  of it and say it's legitimate political discourse on the highest rated cable news [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=537.84s)]
*  show or not to run on that as a political platform. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=542.94s)]
*  And I don't know how to make people stop doing that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=547.82s)]
*  But instead of stopping, they are absconding from responsibility. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=550.94s)]
*  Ben, what happens to these manifestos that get published online or even the live [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=558.3000000000001s)]
*  streams of the killings, which we saw this weekend in Buffalo and we saw previously in [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=565.2s)]
*  Christchurch and in other terrorist attacks like this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=568.94s)]
*  How do those things live online? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  How do they function? And do they accomplish what the killers want, which is to both spread [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  and popularize the ideas that motivate them and also to radicalize and galvanize to action [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=583.26s)]
*  the other people who already believe them? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=589.76s)]
*  Absolutely. This man had a very specific plan on what to do. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=590.88s)]
*  He posted it in his manifesto and then he did it. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=595.78s)]
*  He outlined what he was going to do once he got his camera on his head to go inside to make it look [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=599.62s)]
*  like a first person shooter video game. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=606.5s)]
*  What he was going to do was he was going to post a link to the manifesto, a link to his Twitch stream [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=609.42s)]
*  to people who he had previously interacted with on Discord, on Discord to talk about anything. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=614.3s)]
*  Usually people talk about video games, just a place to chat on the Internet, especially for your [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=618.12s)]
*  teenager. But anyone who's interacted with him got this message. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=622.08s)]
*  Some people who, you know, had nothing to do with extremist politics. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=625.48s)]
*  And it was saying that he was about to go to the supermarket to kill all these people. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=628.72s)]
*  And here was basically just a series of diaries since December of him planning out this attack. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  From there, people on 4chan started to watch this in real time on Twitch. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=638.08s)]
*  Some of those people started to archive this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  And that's how we even know that these videos exist, is that some of the bad guys or some of the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=645.1800000000001s)]
*  people who interact with these people and at least knew the ins and outs of 4chan started posting it [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=649.9s)]
*  there. And that's why this is a problem. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=654.6600000000001s)]
*  This is decentralized. This is something that happened on an Amazon owned company's servers, Twitch, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=657.6600000000001s)]
*  which tried to take this down in real time. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=663.1800000000001s)]
*  Then it was spread to 4chan, then it was spread to other bad websites. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=665.0600000000001s)]
*  There was an 8chan knockoff. 8chan itself is dead, but somebody took the branding and created a [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=668.3000000000001s)]
*  different 8chan website. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=672.38s)]
*  This is not something that you can stop. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=674.96s)]
*  This is something if somebody wants to do it, they can get it out there. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=677.28s)]
*  And they realize, too, that the next person to do this, because they don't think they're the last, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=680.28s)]
*  will include their name in the next manifesto. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's that that manifesto is a recitation of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=687.88s)]
*  everyone else's previous talking points. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=693.2s)]
*  It's literature to them and they build on it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=695.16s)]
*  In fact, there is, you know, the spookiest part about this, I would say to me, is that the format [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=698.06s)]
*  is pretty set now. You go and you write something at the top about white replacement, pretty much [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=703.9399999999999s)]
*  the same thing as the last guy. And then you do a Q&A with yourself to figure out why it's happening. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=708.22s)]
*  Then you list your ammo, drop a bunch of 4chan memes that inspire you. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=713.22s)]
*  It's no different than the last one. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=717.22s)]
*  Actually, a nerd to it at this point, Rachel. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=718.8199999999999s)]
*  But it is, unfortunately, a set thing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=722.5s)]
*  They have figured out exactly the formats for white nationalist terror manifestos. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=726.56s)]
*  Ben Collins covers disinformation, extremism and the Internet for NBC News, which is a very, very [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  difficult beat, difficult in terms of its toll on people who have to cover it every day and what you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=739.12s)]
*  have to see. Ben, thank you for what you do. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=744.6s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=746.24s)]
*  Thanks for the time, Rachel. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=748.6s)]
*  Take air superiority and then roll in with your tanks on the ground like Trupas's lawsuits, blitzkrieg. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=749.32s)]
*  Mr. Brown, the question was about taxes. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=759.0600000000001s)]
*  Back when they told me that we couldn't home school, I prayed about it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=762.1s)]
*  I stood on my hind legs like a man. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=766.22s)]
*  I told them what I thought of them and the television would talk to me for 30 minutes or an hour. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=768.22s)]
*  As it says in my motorcycle club, hey, diddle fiddle right up the middle. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=773.54s)]
*  That's my style. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=778.8399999999999s)]
*  Our wolves, they're here because we let somebody put them here. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  Governor Otter wants to kill a wolf. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=784.64s)]
*  I did kill a wolf while it was still on endangered species. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=786.28s)]
*  So that was a crazy year in Republican politics in the state of Idaho. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=791.0799999999999s)]
*  That was their Republican gubernatorial debate that year. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=795.3599999999999s)]
*  Those were their candidates for governor. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=798.7199999999999s)]
*  This was 2014. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=800.86s)]
*  The incumbent governor was Butch Otter, a pretty conservative Republican with a real fun name. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=801.86s)]
*  But he was not conservative enough for right wing activists in Idaho who wanted to primary him out of office. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=808.6999999999999s)]
*  That year, Idaho conservatives threw their support mostly behind a Tea Party challenger. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=814.6999999999999s)]
*  He's the guy you see on the right side, far right side of the stage. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=819.74s)]
*  But when it came time for the candidates to debate, nobody paid much attention to the Tea Party guy because, oh my God, who's the biker guy and what's with the hey, do? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=823.46s)]
*  Doodle from him. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=830.54s)]
*  And why did that 120 year old man just say he killed a wolf and his TV talks just to him? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=831.54s)]
*  Butch Otter would go on to win that gubernatorial primary and the election that year. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=838.1s)]
*  He served as governor in Idaho for another four years. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=842.6999999999999s)]
*  But at the end of that four years, when Butch Otter left office, he endorsed his lieutenant governor, a man named Brad Little, to be his replacement. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=846.54s)]
*  It's like a fairy tale. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=853.5s)]
*  Butch Otter handing off to Brad Little. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=854.98s)]
*  Now, which of the one that eats is the one that eats no fat and which one eats no lean? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  It's just part of the joy of covering Idaho Republican politics. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=861.88s)]
*  Butch Otter endorses his lieutenant governor, Brad Little. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=866.56s)]
*  Brad Little becomes governor. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=869.24s)]
*  The person who replaces him to become the new lieutenant governor was this person. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=872.04s)]
*  All of us are by nature free and equal and have certain inalienable rights, among which are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property and pursuing happiness and securing safety. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=877.72s)]
*  Wait for it. Here comes the gun. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=899.58s)]
*  Here comes the gun. That's Idaho's current lieutenant governor, Janice McEachin. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=901.1800000000001s)]
*  She was brandishing a gun in that video in order to keep her Bible warm and in order to pressure the governor, her boss, that he should undo COVID rules back in 2020. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=905.28s)]
*  One time when Governor Little left the state, McEachin actually took it upon herself to to announce that she had seized the powers of the governorship and proclaimed the state's mask and vaccine rules to be hereby null and void because the governor was out of town. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=915.56s)]
*  Earlier this year, Ms. McEachin participated in a white supremacist conference at which attendees cheered on Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=931.9s)]
*  She's also, as you've probably guessed by now, an enthusiastic election denier. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=940.0999999999999s)]
*  The reason I'm telling you all of this is because tomorrow that lieutenant governor Janice McEachin is going to face off against her boss, the incumbent governor Brad Little in the Idaho Republican primary for governor. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=944.9s)]
*  Naturally, because she's an election denier, Janice McEachin earned the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=956.88s)]
*  She's not the only right-wing election denier running for statewide office in Idaho. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=963.16s)]
*  There's no incumbent in the secretary of state in Idaho. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=966.8s)]
*  Two of the three Republican candidates who are running to be secretary of state are also election deniers who say that President Trump won the election and President Biden is a usurper. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=969.8s)]
*  The Republican attorney general in Idaho is also being primary tomorrow by another election denier. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=978.88s)]
*  I know there's a lot of attention on the Pennsylvania Republican primary tomorrow where there is deep, deep insanity in the Republican primary races for governor and senate and even for lieutenant governor. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=984.66s)]
*  But I'm telling you, don't sleep on Idaho. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=995.34s)]
*  Idaho is tomorrow too, and there is plenty of crazy to go around. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=997.74s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1001.9399999999999s)]
*  The city of Buffalo, New York has a beautiful, extensive and famous system of parks. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1005.58s)]
*  The legendary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, after he designed Central Park in New York City, he had an even bigger vision for Buffalo, a system of multiple city parks connected by tree-lined parkways, thereby integrating the parks into the city. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1012.92s)]
*  And one of those early parkways was called Humboldt Parkway. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1028.48s)]
*  And in the first half of the 20th century, a black middle-class neighborhood called Hamlin Park began to emerge around it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1033.04s)]
*  It was lovely. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1040.16s)]
*  And so, of course, as in black neighborhoods and cities across the country, in the 1950s and the 1960s, city planners decided to build a giant highway right through the middle of it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1042.56s)]
*  First, they cut down all those grand trees on Humboldt Parkway. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1052.0s)]
*  Then they dug out the whole parkway to construct an expressway to better connect mostly white suburban drivers to downtown Buffalo. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1055.92s)]
*  That new expressway cut off that black community in Buffalo. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1063.96s)]
*  It also poured more pollution into that black neighborhood, which over the decades has had serious health implications for that community. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1067.7s)]
*  It also cut off black residents stuck on the east side of that highway from the basic necessities of life, like grocery stores. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1074.42s)]
*  That's why in 2003, something as simple as a grocery store finally opening on Buffalo's east side, that was a big newsmaking event. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1083.5s)]
*  Because residents on the east side had been calling for a grocery store, literally something that basic and simple, for years and years and years before they finally got one. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1093.16s)]
*  When that grocery store, the Tops Market on Jefferson Avenue, opened in 2003, it became not just the local grocery store, but a community gathering place for the resilient, long-standing east side black community in Buffalo. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1101.84s)]
*  And that's why it was targeted. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKs-dtl7OI&t=1117.32s)]
*  In his racist online rantings, the gunman who killed 10 people and injured three more at that Tops Market this weekend, he said he zeroed in on the specific zip code of that store because it had one of the highest shares of black residents in all of New York State.
