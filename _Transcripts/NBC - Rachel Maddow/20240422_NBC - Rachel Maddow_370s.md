# 'Like a child, give him a time out': Weissmann urges 'firm hand' as Trump flouts gag order
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM)
*  So under an order imposed by the court in this criminal case, Donald Trump is not allowed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=0.0s)]
*  to make or direct others to make public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=5.68s)]
*  concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  He's not allowed to do that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=18.72s)]
*  The prosecution is now arguing that Trump has done that a lot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=20.84s)]
*  There'll be a hearing tomorrow morning at 930 Eastern before the jurors come into the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=24.8s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=29.2s)]
*  Prosecutors are going to ask the judge to find that former President Trump willfully [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  violated the gag order by attacking well-known potential witnesses, including Stormy Daniels [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=34.2s)]
*  and Michael Cohen, attacking their credibility on up to 10 separate occasions. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=39.0s)]
*  If the judge finds Trump in criminal contempt of court on these matters, Trump could be [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=43.9s)]
*  fined up to $1,000 each for each violation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=50.04s)]
*  That's what the prosecutors are asking for. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=52.96s)]
*  He could possibly be sentenced to a maximum of 30 days in jail, although prosecutors [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=55.06s)]
*  are certainly not asking for that yet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=59.22s)]
*  I mean, tonight Trump sent around a fundraising email called My Farewell Message, making it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=61.46s)]
*  sound like he's definitely going to jail. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  I already meant to ask our legal experts about it, but we just queued up some new sound from [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=70.86s)]
*  Donald Trump today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=76.22s)]
*  This is from an interview on a conservative network called Real America's Voice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=77.22s)]
*  Here it is Donald Trump talking about the jury in his trial. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=83.22s)]
*  That jury was picked so fast. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=89.22s)]
*  95% Democrats. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=91.9s)]
*  The area is mostly all Democrat. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=94.42s)]
*  You think of it as just a purely Democrat area. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=96.62s)]
*  It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=99.9s)]
*  That jury, 95% Democrats. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  Again, the last item in the gag order forbids Trump from making or directing others to make [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=106.06s)]
*  public statements about any prospective juror or any juror in this criminal proceeding. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=111.62s)]
*  Andrew Weissman, still with us here tonight. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=118.42s)]
*  The gag order has been the discussion that I feel like we've had around the edges of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  this case a lot because it's the way that Trump has tried to kind of shape the environment [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=126.9s)]
*  around this case. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=130.86s)]
*  It's going to be in the courtroom front and center tomorrow morning at 930. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=132.66s)]
*  What do you expect Judge Marshawn is going to do? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  What are you going to be watching for? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=138.38s)]
*  So you have Donald Trump clearly goading the judge. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=141.1s)]
*  The fact that he's doing something that appears by all accounts to be a direct violation of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  the order as late as tonight in advance of a 930 hearing on violations with respect to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=152.45999999999998s)]
*  witnesses and a violation with respect to jurors, both of which are things that a judge [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=160.74s)]
*  is going to care tremendously about. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=166.04s)]
*  I think the, you know, obviously he's going to hear from the defense and, you know, the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=169.66s)]
*  betting is that he's going to certainly say that there was a violation and he could impose [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=174.14s)]
*  the fine that is obviously negligible and he can saber-rattle about what's next. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=179.9s)]
*  This is one where what I would say if I were, like if he were sitting right here, I would [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=186.98s)]
*  say leave aside politics, leave aside what he's goading somebody to do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=192.46s)]
*  What would you do for any other defendant? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=199.42s)]
*  We have seen the legal system bend over sort of so far to accommodate Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=203.38s)]
*  He is not being treated worse. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  He is being treated so much better, whether you're talking about DOJ, whether you're talking [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=213.26s)]
*  about all of the criminal cases. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=218.06s)]
*  And this is one where he wouldn't have to impose 30 days in jail, but he can really [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=221.06s)]
*  do like a child, give him a timeout. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=226.16s)]
*  He can be stepped back and be kept in the pens in the courthouse. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=228.42s)]
*  But I think this is so clearly like a child testing what will happen. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=232.7s)]
*  And it's at the very outset of the case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=237.14s)]
*  If there isn't a firm hand right now and the rule of law isn't imposed, it really is a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  terrible message in terms of how the trial is going to go forward because he's going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=245.54s)]
*  to continue doing this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=250.04s)]
*  And if there are jurors he doesn't like, he can attack them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=251.54s)]
*  And if he's going to try and seek a mistrial by his antics, that's something he could try. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=255.4s)]
*  So the court, who is extremely experienced, I think is going to have to be really careful [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=259.52s)]
*  about what exact is the sanction he's going to impose tomorrow. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=265.16s)]
*  How will the judge decide or how will the hearing on this go? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=268.76s)]
*  Again, this is going to be the way that court starts tomorrow. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=272.72s)]
*  Is he going to ask defense, is he just going to rule or is he going to ask defense counsel [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=276.08s)]
*  and the prosecutors to make arguments in front of him? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=281.24s)]
*  Is he going to have a witness talk? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=283.28s)]
*  So he could ask both sides to state their position. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=285.55999999999995s)]
*  He could see if there is a dispute of facts. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=289.32s)]
*  You could actually have a hearing on this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=293.32s)]
*  But there may not be a dispute of facts. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=296.32s)]
*  The facts seem so clear unless Donald Trump is going to say somebody else took over my [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  account. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  Roger Stone tried that when he was in violation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  He actually took the witness stand and said, I didn't do that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=307.76s)]
*  And then he later sort of recanted and said, OK, I did do it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=311.0s)]
*  And that was when he posted the judge's picture with crosshairs next to her head. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=314.68s)]
*  And so there can be a hearing, but it may not be necessary. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  Just given the volume of allegations here, there's now, I think, up to 11 allegations [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  that are going to be before the judge. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  But ultimately, it would be the state's burden to go forward. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KArbXJKP7bM&t=335.47999999999996s)]
