# Tech 'solution' makes a fool of Trump again; Federal return to office order bungled
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM)
*  Meanwhile, here's how the Trump administration is doing with its management of the federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=0.0s)]
*  government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=6.2s)]
*  Just in today's news, this is from The Washington Post. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Quote, last week, amid the scramble inside federal agencies to meet Trump's return to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=10.84s)]
*  office mandate, one CDC employee received links to a new government-wide initiative [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=14.96s)]
*  promising to connect those who need workspace with those who have extra seats. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=20.84s)]
*  When the CDC employee entered her home address to find nearby offices, she was surprised [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=26.64s)]
*  to receive suggestions for a closed subway sandwich shop and a self-storage facility. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=31.84s)]
*  Another member of her CDC team was directed to a post office. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  So they work at the CDC. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  They were told to report for work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=47.6s)]
*  The Trump administration told them to report for work at a post office or a closed subway [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=49.38s)]
*  sandwich shop or a mini storage. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=54.12s)]
*  CDC employees. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Sure, try it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  See how it goes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=61.36s)]
*  Quote, another worker from a federal scientific agency was asked by an administrator to fill [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  out a similar space request form, part of a Trump administration rollout of such services, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=67.36s)]
*  including one they're calling Space Match, aimed at connecting federal employees with [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=73.12s)]
*  offices where they could work. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=78.32s)]
*  When the federal scientific agency worker entered her information, the two closest offices [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=80.28s)]
*  to which she was recommended did not seem to be federal offices at all. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=85.48s)]
*  Quote, one appeared to be a building in an industrial zone that appeared to host support [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=90.4s)]
*  groups for people dealing with alcohol or debt problems. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=95.5s)]
*  The other appeared to be a private home in a four-unit building. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=98.9s)]
*  So this is a person who has a job at a federal scientific agency. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=105.22s)]
*  Donald Trump has a new high-tech tool, a fancy new website that has assigned to this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=109.48s)]
*  person a new place to work. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  And the new place to work, this person has a choice, can either be a rehab or the house [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=117.06s)]
*  of someone who this person doesn't know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=123.84s)]
*  Space Match. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=128.38s)]
*  I bet it has an X in it somewhere. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=129.38s)]
*  Space Match. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=132.02s)]
*  These guys are so tech savvy, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=133.08s)]
*  They're so efficient. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=135.16s)]
*  You know, taxes are due in a month. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=136.88s)]
*  Taxes are due April 15th. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=140.96s)]
*  This week, Donald Trump, in his infinite wisdom, told people who work at the IRS that they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=143.04s)]
*  should show up to work at buildings for which there are no desks for them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=147.32s)]
*  Quote, they have people in conference rooms, cafeterias and even some closets. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=152.72s)]
*  A Q&A handout was given to IRS employees. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=158.96s)]
*  It included this question, how should I store my laptop and accessories at the end of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=162.2s)]
*  day if I don't have a permanent desk? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=166.36s)]
*  The answer, quote, employees should secure their laptops and equipment in secure locations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  such as via cable lock to a designated storage area, locker or permanent furniture fixture. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  This is what they're telling IRS to do. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Buy a cable lock, like for your bike, and then like lock your laptop to a credenza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=190.04s)]
*  Or maybe you can find a really heavy potted plant. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=197.72s)]
*  See if you can find a pillar. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=201.32s)]
*  And then you can lock your laptop to that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=203.64s)]
*  All your stuff. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=206.0s)]
*  You just lock your stuff to that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=207.0s)]
*  Hopefully everything's got like hooks. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=208.12s)]
*  That's how Donald Trump is running the IRS, the agency that collects all the funds that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  run the federal government. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=216.68s)]
*  That's how he's running the agency that is supposed to process hundreds of millions of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=218.42s)]
*  tax returns that are due in one month. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=222.38s)]
*  Do you think you're going to get your refund this year? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=226.06s)]
*  We are keeping a close eye tonight on what is going on at the IRS. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=233.22s)]
*  Even with all the probationary employees ordered reinstated today, the Washington Post broke [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  the news today that Trump intends now to fire another 18,000 people from the IRS. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=241.2s)]
*  He wants them gone by May 15th. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=247.94s)]
*  There also appears to be a lot of concern about one particular firing that just happened [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=252.24s)]
*  there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=255.94s)]
*  They just fired the top lawyer at the IRS. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=256.94s)]
*  That is reportedly ringing some major alarm bells by people who know how that agency works. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=258.66s)]
*  So we will be keeping eyes on the IRS. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm5eADeNMbM&t=263.34s)]
