**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg)
*  Here's the local press coverage on what Governor Glenn Youngkin had to do today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=0.0s)]
*  Dateline Richmond. Governor Glenn Youngkin said today that the state is preparing an [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=4.8s)]
*  aid package for Virginians losing their jobs in the Trump administration's gutting of the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  federal workforce. But he said the cuts are necessary. In his first extended public remarks [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=14.32s)]
*  on the cuts, Youngkin told reporters that he feels deep concern for those who are anxious [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=21.92s)]
*  about their employment future as the White House purges people at almost every agency. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=26.16s)]
*  Hundreds of workers at the FAA lost their jobs over the weekend, for example, and a sweeping [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=30.8s)]
*  elimination of workers ahead of a Tuesday deadline affected mapmakers and cancer researchers and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=36.64s)]
*  FEMA staffers, among thousands more cut over the past few weeks. But Youngkin defended the Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=42.16s)]
*  administration's actions, which disproportionately affect Virginia as one of the top states in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=47.6s)]
*  country for federal employment and spending with more than 140,000 federal workers. Even one of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=52.72s)]
*  Youngkin's signature achievements, a computer science laboratory high school in Richmond, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=58.32s)]
*  has been touched by the cuts with cancellation of a federal grant for a teacher residency program. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=63.36s)]
*  The governor said he wanted it known that, quote, we understand and we're here to help. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=69.52s)]
*  He said the state, quote, will have the ability to support federal workers through any job [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=74.48s)]
*  dislocation. But the governor declined to provide details about what kind of help the state is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=79.84s)]
*  prepared to offer. He said that when the plan is ready, quote, I want to communicate it in a package. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=85.92s)]
*  We'll have a good one for you. We'll get back to me. Well, it'll be I don't know what it's going to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=92.08s)]
*  be. It's going to be good. I don't know. It'll be great. We're going to come up with something. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=99.2s)]
*  In the meantime, please report that I said that I support Donald Trump a thousand percent [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=104.16s)]
*  and also that I am working to figure out how to clean up the giant, deliberate mess he is making [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=109.92s)]
*  of people's lives and our economy in this state, for which I have a lot of empathy say that too, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=114.96s)]
*  even though I definitely a thousand percent support this infliction of pain on people who [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=121.52s)]
*  live in my state and even on myself, even though we've done nothing wrong. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=125.84s)]
*  Can you get all that in the lead? Thank you, sir. May I have another? Can you put that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=130.32s)]
*  as the caption that I mentioned that Virginia has elections this year? Just a few months. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=134.0s)]
*  You feel like you're Republican politicians in Virginia looking out for you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=143.52s)]
*  So we're going to keep watching this dynamic Republicans who can't actually bear what Trump [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=149.76s)]
*  is doing to their own states and to their own constituents, but they're too scared to say they're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=153.76s)]
*  against it. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska asking for exemptions to Trump's cuts and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=158.96s)]
*  actions specifically for Indian tribes in Alaska. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa asking [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=165.28s)]
*  for an exemption for Iowa farmers to the tariffs on Canada. Republican Florida Congresswoman Maria [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=171.12s)]
*  Alvarez Salazar asking for an exemption to the indiscriminate deportation policies. Republican [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=176.8s)]
*  Senator Katie Britt asking for an exemption on the massive cuts to scientific and medical research, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=182.72s)]
*  saying, you couldn't possibly mean Alabama for those cuts, could you? Not Alabama. You want these [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=188.4s)]
*  cuts elsewhere, right? Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine saying the same thing, saying, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  surely those cuts don't apply to the universities and labs in Maine. She said if it applies to the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=200.88s)]
*  ones in Maine, that would be quote devastating. So certainly they don't mean Maine, right? They [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=206.56s)]
*  couldn't. Republicans just eating it in their home districts and their home states as their [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=212.96s)]
*  party's leader does things that are devastating to those states and to those constituents. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  And just seeing that in states all over the country is a lot of things. It gives me many, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  many feelings of many different kinds. But as a matter of political science, it's also important [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=234.08s)]
*  to watch in terms of what kinds of constraints this president, this administration might ever [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=240.24s)]
*  feel. Political scientists will tell you that one of the only constraints that matter on an [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  ascending authoritarian is the constraints put on him by his own party. The distance between [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=250.96s)]
*  what people think they voted for and what people realize they got ultimately does matter. Sometimes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  it's the only thing that matters. The Wall Street Journal yesterday spoke with Trump voters [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=266.56s)]
*  who just one month in say they are now horrified by what they helped cause when they voted for Trump. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=273.36s)]
*  Quote, Stacey White says she voted for President Trump because she wanted lower prices and to stop [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=280.16s)]
*  fentanyl from coming into the U.S. Now with widespread federal layoffs and expected cuts, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=284.88s)]
*  she worries her family will lose their house if her partner is laid off from his government [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=289.6s)]
*  adjacent job. At the dialysis unit where she works, staff has started doing drills for what [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=294.0s)]
*  to do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement comes to deport their patients. Stacey said, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=299.04s)]
*  quote, when we said safer borders, I thought he was thinking let's stop the drugs from coming [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=304.96s)]
*  into the country. I didn't know he was going to start raiding places. She said she didn't believe [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=309.04s)]
*  he would actually follow through on some of the more hardline policies he touted during the campaign. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=314.64s)]
*  The 49-year-old Omaha, Nebraska resident said, quote, now I'm like, dang, why didn't I just pick [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=320.0s)]
*  Kamala? Emily Anderson from Duluth, Minnesota, categorizes her vote for Trump this year as the, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=326.16s)]
*  quote, biggest mistake of my life. She is horrified by Trump's focus on deportations and use of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=334.72s)]
*  Guantanamo Bay to hold migrants. She says that Trump has been too focused on, quote, ridiculous [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=340.32000000000005s)]
*  flashy moves such as banning paper straws and renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=346.8s)]
*  Anderson's daughter is an occupational, Anderson's daughter's occupational therapist has stopped [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=353.36s)]
*  taking new patients over fears that the practice will have its federal funding dry up. Anderson [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=359.92s)]
*  said, quote, I feel so stupid, guilty, regretful, embarrassed is a huge one. I'm absolutely [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=365.68s)]
*  embarrassed that I voted for Trump. So as long as we still have a political process, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=371.52s)]
*  voters feeling that way, Trump voters feeling that way, Republican elected officials desperately [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=380.64s)]
*  seeking exemptions for their state from what Trump is doing to try to save their constituents [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  from what Trump is doing, saying Trump's policies are bad if they apply in their state. Republicans [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=391.28s)]
*  finding Trump's actions and chaos and dysfunction not only damaging but indefensible and they're [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=396.48s)]
*  being caught out at home unable to defend the indefensible. If we still have a political process, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  that will matter in terms of what Trump can do and for how long. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=408.32s)]
*  you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i915Ub6Akxg&t=426.48s)]
