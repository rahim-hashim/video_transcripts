# 'They Need To Stop Him': Clinton Calls On Putin Aides To 'Act For The Good Of Russia'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk)
*  Madam Secretary, one of the things that's happened in recent days is that people who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=0.0s)]
*  have spent time with Putin, who have sat across the table from him at negotiations and talks [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=4.04s)]
*  over the years, say that as much as they might have either disliked or thought that Putin [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=8.82s)]
*  was ruthless before, he seems different. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=14.6s)]
*  He doesn't seem like himself. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=17.92s)]
*  He seems like there might be something wrong with him, that he might be nuts. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=19.48s)]
*  We've heard that from people who have been in diplomatic negotiations with him before. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=24.76s)]
*  I wanted to get your take on that, both as somebody who has spent time with him, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  also your take on whether or not that should factor into how we strategize against him now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=33.4s)]
*  Well, it's a difficult question to answer from afar, obviously. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=40.28s)]
*  I think the reports coming out suggest both his temperament, his paranoia seems to have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=45.68s)]
*  dramatically. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=56.24s)]
*  His vindictiveness, his dictatorial approach to the people around him, including his own [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=57.84s)]
*  military leadership, seems to have gone further and deeper than anybody had ever seen before. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=63.26s)]
*  People have also suggested that maybe physically he's facing some health challenges. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=71.14s)]
*  I think it's important for leaders, intelligence agencies, to get the best information they [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=76.72s)]
*  can. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=82.36s)]
*  But ultimately, the people closest to Putin, those who have to deal with him, those who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=83.36s)]
*  he's keeping at the end of 40-foot tables while he issues bizarre orders, they're the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=88.12s)]
*  ones who need to act. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=95.12s)]
*  They need to act for the good of Russia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=96.8s)]
*  They need to stop him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=100.8s)]
*  Whether or not this has turned into some kind of physical or mental problems that he either [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=103.26s)]
*  had or has in some way come down with, we don't know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=111.28s)]
*  But his behavior is dangerous, and it's dangerous to the future of Russia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=116.38s)]
*  So my hope is that the people who are watching him, those who get close enough to see in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=122.52s)]
*  person his behavior, which is so erratic, that they can try to prevent him from doing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=129.72s)]
*  things that will not only be tragic for Ukraine, but tragic for Russia too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  This should be stopped for Russia's sake. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05YXmRXNDIk&t=144.67999999999998s)]
