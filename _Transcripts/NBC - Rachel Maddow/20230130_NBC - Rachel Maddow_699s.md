# Trump Stormy Daniels payment case resumes beyond reach of Bill Barr's obstacles
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ)
*  Jeffrey Berman was the U.S. attorney in SDNY, the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  while all this was happening. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=6.36s)]
*  And Jeffrey Berman technically was recused from directly overseeing this case, the Hush [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=8.32s)]
*  Money case, because he had been part of the Trump campaign before he was appointed U.S. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=13.68s)]
*  attorney. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And he thought that might have seemed like a conflict of interest, given that the case [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  involved fraud allegations about campaign expenditures. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  So he was technically recused from overseeing the case. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=26.96s)]
*  But he was in charge of the U.S. attorney's office when this case went to court. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=29.16s)]
*  And in his book, in this book holding the line that Jeffrey Berman published about his [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=32.54s)]
*  time as U.S. attorney in SDNY, he explains in detail that Maine Justice, under Trump, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=36.02s)]
*  reached into SDNY and intervened with the prosecutor's office in Manhattan to protect [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=43.28s)]
*  Trump in this case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  He says it explicitly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=52.04s)]
*  This is from page 24 of Jeff Berman's book. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=53.04s)]
*  Quote, the first time Maine Justice interfered, even though I was not overseeing the Cohen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=56.2s)]
*  case, I still had to deal with other issues involving it, all of them deriving from the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=61.84s)]
*  same source, Maine Justice and its attempts at interference. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  The first time Maine Justice interfered was when the information was being finalized. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=68.92s)]
*  Information is a term of art in this context. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  After Michael Cohen agreed to plead guilty, the charging instrument against him became [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=77.78s)]
*  an information rather than indictment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=83.36s)]
*  So that was the title of the document that Berman is referencing here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=86.32s)]
*  It was an information. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=88.92s)]
*  It was about 40 pages long, he says, and it, quote, referenced a person identified as individual [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=89.92s)]
*  one as having acted in concert with Michael Cohen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=95.32s)]
*  He says, quote, there was zero doubt as to the identity of individual one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=98.52s)]
*  It was Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Berman says, quote, consistent with DOJ guidelines, we first submitted the information to the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  public integrity section at Maine Justice. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=108.76s)]
*  They signed off. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=110.72s)]
*  We then sent a copy to the deputy attorney general at the time, Rod Rosenstein, informing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=111.72s)]
*  him that Cohen's guilty plea was imminent. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=116.8s)]
*  The next day, the prosecutor in my office who was overseeing the case received a call [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=119.16s)]
*  from Rosenstein's principal deputy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=123.16s)]
*  He was aggressive. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=125.48s)]
*  Why the length, he wanted to know. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=126.84s)]
*  He argued that now that Cohen is pleading guilty, we don't need all this description [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=128.7s)]
*  of the crime. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=132.72s)]
*  The prosecutor responded, what exactly are you concerned about? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=134.36s)]
*  Rosenstein's deputy proceeded to identify specific allegations that he wanted removed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=138.76s)]
*  from the information. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=145.0s)]
*  Almost all of them were items referencing individual one, Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Quote, it quickly became apparent that it wasn't the overall length or detail of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=152.64s)]
*  document that concerned him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=156.56s)]
*  It was any mention of individual one. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=158.2s)]
*  The two men went through a handful of these allegations, some of which the prosecutor [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=161.6s)]
*  agreed to strike. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=165.04s)]
*  Others, he did not. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=166.24s)]
*  The revised document, now 21 pages, remember it had started as 40 pages, now 21 pages, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  kept all of the charges to which Cohen was pleading guilty, but removed certain allegations, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=175.68s)]
*  including allegations that individual one acted in concert with and coordinated with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=181.84s)]
*  Cohen on the illegal campaign contributions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=186.4s)]
*  Berman goes on to describe how Trump appointed attorney general William Barr personally intervened [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=189.96s)]
*  in the Hush Money investigation later as well. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=195.58s)]
*  Quote, while Cohen had pleaded guilty, our office continued to pursue investigations [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=198.5s)]
*  related to possible campaign finance violations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=203.18s)]
*  When Barr took over as attorney general in February 2019, six months after Cohen had [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=206.74s)]
*  pleaded guilty, Barr not only tried to kill the ongoing investigations, but incredibly [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  suggested that Michael Cohen's conviction on campaign finance charges could be retroactively [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  reversed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  Barr summoned the prosecutor leading the Hush Money case in late February. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=223.38s)]
*  So this is one of the first things Barr does when he becomes attorney general. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=227.66s)]
*  He only becomes attorney general in February. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=230.5s)]
*  Before the end of that month, he summons the lead prosecutor on the Hush Money case to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=233.14s)]
*  quote, challenge the basis of Cohen's guilty plea, as well as the reasoning behind pursuing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=238.34s)]
*  similar campaign finance charges against other individuals. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=243.82s)]
*  The prosecutor was told to cease all investigative work on the campaign finance allegations until [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=247.5s)]
*  the Office of Legal Counsel, a part of Maine Justice, determined if there was a legal basis [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=253.66s)]
*  for the campaign finance charges to which Cohen pled guilty and until Barr determined [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=258.3s)]
*  there was a sufficient federal interest in pursuing charges against others. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=262.74s)]
*  The directive Barr gave the prosecutor, which was amplified that same day by a follow-up [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  phone call, was explicit. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=271.9s)]
*  Not a single investigative step could be taken. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=274.46s)]
*  Not a single document in our possession could be reviewed until the issue was resolved. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  And if Maine Justice decided there was no legal basis for the Cohen charges, the attorney [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=280.82s)]
*  general of the United States would direct us to dismiss the guilty pleas of Michael [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=285.06s)]
*  Cohen, the man who implicated the attorney general's boss, the president. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=289.82s)]
*  Berman closes with this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=295.42s)]
*  He says, quote, I've tried not to make assumptions about the motivations of Barr or anyone else. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=296.42s)]
*  I am a lawyer trained to deal in fact. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=300.7s)]
*  But Barr's posture here raises obvious questions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=302.9s)]
*  Did he think dropping the campaign finance charges would bolster Trump's defense against [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=305.62s)]
*  impeachment charges? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=310.02s)]
*  Was he trying to ensure that no other Trump associates or employees would be charged with [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=311.02s)]
*  making hush money payments to perhaps flip on the president? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=315.7s)]
*  Was it part of an effort to undo the entire series of investigations and prosecutions [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=319.82s)]
*  over the past two years of those in the president's orbit? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  People like Michael Cohen, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=326.82s)]
*  Berman says, quote, was the goal to ensure that the president himself could not be charged [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  after leaving office? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=335.14s)]
*  Jeffrey Berman then goes on to explain in his book that Barr subsequently tried to take [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=338.86s)]
*  the whole hush money case out of SDNY, take it out of his office and give it to another [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=344.5s)]
*  U.S. attorney. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=349.14s)]
*  Berman apparently successfully blocked that effort from Barr. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=350.42s)]
*  Berman also explains that the standoff between his prosecutor's office and Maine Justice [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=353.74s)]
*  went on for months while Maine Justice explicitly barred SDNY federal prosecutors from looking [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=359.14s)]
*  at a single document or taking a single investigative step of any kind. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=365.62s)]
*  While this one guy, Michael Cohen, is sentenced to prison, even though that same prosecutor's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=371.7s)]
*  office had named another person with whom Michael Cohen committed this felony. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=377.38s)]
*  And so no, they never charged that other person. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=383.66s)]
*  They never charged Trump, even though they concluded and told the court that he had committed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=385.58s)]
*  the crime with Cohen. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=389.46s)]
*  Never charged him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=390.86s)]
*  Never tried to charge him. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=391.86s)]
*  Never tried to charge anyone else. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=393.62s)]
*  And then it got worse because New York Times reporters William Rashbaum and Ben Protest [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=396.06s)]
*  reported at the New York Times in August 2019 that in addition to effectively botching this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=401.62s)]
*  as a federal case and federal prosecution, federal prosecutors in SDNY also blocked anyone [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=407.98s)]
*  else from pursuing this case either. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=414.58s)]
*  I mean, making illegal campaign expenditures, whether or not you lie about it on your company [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=418.74s)]
*  books by calling it legal expenses, making illegal campaign expenditures is a crime in [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=424.74s)]
*  every state as well as a federal crime. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=429.38s)]
*  And New York state prosecutors were therefore interested when the details of this crime [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=433.14s)]
*  became known, when Michael Cohen started telling Congress and telling the public what he'd [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=438.94s)]
*  been involved in. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=442.58s)]
*  New York state prosecutors were interested in pursuing potential state charges related [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  to this crime. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=450.17999999999995s)]
*  But as William Rashbaum and Ben Protest reported at the New York Times, quote, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=453.38s)]
*  The New York District Attorney's Office initially considered mounting an inquiry in 2018, but [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=458.18s)]
*  the office paused that effort at the request of federal prosecutors. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  So federal prosecutors get blown up by Trump's DOJ, by main justice under Trump, for even [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=468.46000000000004s)]
*  just bringing a case against Michael Cohen. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=475.90000000000003s)]
*  They get ordered to not investigate anyone else for these crimes. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  They get threatened that even Cohen's going to be let go too despite the fact that he [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=481.04s)]
*  pled guilty. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  Federal prosecutors at SDNY fold in the face of that pressure. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=486.7s)]
*  And simultaneously, they tell state prosecutors that they can't look at the case either. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=492.73999999999995s)]
*  You can't look at this actually. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  This is where the feds and we're handling this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=497.61999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the feds were not handling this. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=500.46s)]
*  At least they were not handling this well. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=502.53999999999996s)]
*  But while they were botching it, they were preventing other prosecutors who could have [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=505.85999999999996s)]
*  pursued it on their own terms without pressure from main justice. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  And that brings us to today's news, to this finally starting to clear up for us as a country, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=515.58s)]
*  finally starting to get clear of the mess that President Donald Trump and Attorney General [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=521.94s)]
*  Bill Barr made of American law, particularly where it comes to public corruption. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=526.4200000000001s)]
*  These things don't just disappear into the ether. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=530.58s)]
*  They create precedent. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=532.6600000000001s)]
*  They worm away at the integrity and the basic core functions of the U.S. Justice Department. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=534.7s)]
*  And unless and until they are fixed or corrected, it just rots the system. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=541.06s)]
*  This stuff can't be left to dangle. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=546.54s)]
*  It has to be tied off. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=549.26s)]
*  Even if the federal prosecutors aren't going to do it themselves, somebody's going to have to. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=553.4599999999999s)]
*  And today, New York Times reporter William Rosbaum and his colleagues at the Times were [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=558.18s)]
*  first to report that New York state prosecutors, as of today, have started presenting evidence [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=561.7399999999999s)]
*  to a grand jury related to this case. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=567.06s)]
*  And this time, it is not about Michael Cohen. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=570.12s)]
*  This time, it is finally about Trump. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=572.28s)]
*  Quote, the Manhattan district attorney's office today began presenting evidence to a grand [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=574.6s)]
*  jury about Donald J. Trump's role in paying hush money to a porn star during his 2016 [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=578.8s)]
*  presidential campaign, laying the groundwork for potential criminal charges against the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=584.08s)]
*  former president. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=588.28s)]
*  The grand jury was recently impaneled. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=589.7s)]
*  The beginning of witness testimony today represents a clear signal that the district attorney [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=591.76s)]
*  Alvin Bragg is nearing a decision about whether to charge Mr. Trump. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=596.24s)]
*  This has been a weird saga. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=601.28s)]
*  This has been an on again, off again criminal case. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=603.04s)]
*  At core, it is a simple crime. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=607.16s)]
*  It is a very understandable crime, one in which the evidence is really clear. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=608.92s)]
*  And for years now, I mean, we're going on seven years since the crime, five years since [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=614.64s)]
*  people started going to prison for it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=618.64s)]
*  For years now, people have been doing back flips to make sure that there are no charges, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=620.4s)]
*  no consequences for the guy who prosecutors say committed the crime and who is the only [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=624.2s)]
*  person who benefited from it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=628.6s)]
*  The purpose of this crime was to help Donald Trump's campaign for president. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=632.0s)]
*  He did become president, which apparently does give you carte blanche to stay out of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  handcuffs for four years while you're occupying the Oval Office. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=642.0s)]
*  But not after. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=645.88s)]
*  It doesn't last. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=650.0s)]
*  Once you're out. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=651.44s)]
*  Once you are out of the Oval Office, you're supposed to go back to being the kind of person [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=652.48s)]
*  who isn't allowed to get caught committing crimes without having to pay. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=655.84s)]
*  It has taken all of these years. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  I am happy to say that Stormy Daniels is doing fine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=663.8800000000001s)]
*  She's doing better than fine. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=666.7600000000001s)]
*  But we're about to find out if we can say the same about the rule of law and the justice [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  system, which they really royally screwed up in their time in office. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b6ieQVRWQ&t=673.72s)]
