**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc)
*  For the past six and a half months, the most powerful telescope in the history of the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=0.0s)]
*  has been on its one million mile mission to look at the very first galaxies and stars [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=4.58s)]
*  ever formed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=10.02s)]
*  Tonight, we finally got to see the first full color, full resolution images, our first image [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=11.02s)]
*  from that telescope. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=16.2s)]
*  It's the deepest look into the universe ever from the most powerful telescope ever made. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=17.88s)]
*  Some of the biggest, brightest lights in this image took 4.6 billion years to get to the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=23.6s)]
*  telescope. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=29.32s)]
*  So looking at those lights on this image is like looking that far back in time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=30.32s)]
*  NASA says actually some of the faintest lights in this image are almost as old as the universe [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=35.0s)]
*  itself. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=39.2s)]
*  They're over 13 billion years old. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=40.2s)]
*  Tomorrow at 1030 a.m. Eastern, NASA is going to unveil more photos from the Webb telescope, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=43.88s)]
*  but that's the first one. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=47.8s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=49.44s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz0R_2v5dSc&t=51.44s)]
