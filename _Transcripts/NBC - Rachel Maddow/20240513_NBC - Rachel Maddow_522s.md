# The smart thing Trump probably won't do next in his criminal trial
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU)
*  One of the things that happened today in Michael Cohen's testimony is that he described the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=0.0s)]
*  circumstances under which he made a recording of himself speaking to his boss, speaking [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=4.7s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=10.74s)]
*  It was a recording of an in-person meeting. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=12.06s)]
*  He walked into Trump's office with the VoiceNotes app on his phone recording while he either [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=14.4s)]
*  held his phone or had it in his pocket or near his pocket. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=20.2s)]
*  The reason he said he made the recording is because David Pecker from American media expected [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=23.42s)]
*  to be paid back $150,000 that American media had advanced to a woman named Karen McDougal, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=29.12s)]
*  who had claimed that she had had a long affair with Donald Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=36.92s)]
*  AMI, as part of its alleged scheme with Donald Trump to suppress negative information about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=41.52s)]
*  him in order to benefit his campaign, had paid McDougal ostensibly to do some work for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=46.44s)]
*  their magazine empire, but really so that they would own the life rights to that story [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=53.46s)]
*  about Donald Trump and make sure that that story never saw the light of day. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=58.6s)]
*  Now, at some point after AMI had advanced that money, Cohen and Trump, according to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=62.36s)]
*  Trump, decided, excuse me, according to Cohen, decided that they would purchase those rights [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  from AMI. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=74.08s)]
*  They would effectively reimburse AMI for having made that outlay of cash, but in so doing, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=75.68s)]
*  they would buy those life rights themselves and for a while they talked about including [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=81.94s)]
*  in that purchase price the treasure chest of information that American media had accumulated [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=88.12s)]
*  over time about the life and loves of Donald Trump, a locked drawer reportedly full of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  information about Trump. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=100.72s)]
*  They thought for their $150,000, they could get the Karen McDougal rights. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=102.28s)]
*  They could get all the Trump stuff. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=106.48s)]
*  They were worried to get that information because Cohen testified today that David Pecker, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  the head of this magazine empire, they believed was going to get a different job at Time Incorporated. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=113.28s)]
*  He was going to leave. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=118.0s)]
*  That would mean David Pecker, their friend and protector, the member of this conspiracy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=119.24s)]
*  with them, was going to leave behind at AMI all of that information about Trump in that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=123.56s)]
*  locked door. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=128.44s)]
*  Wouldn't that in that locked drawer? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=129.44s)]
*  Wouldn't that be terrible? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=131.08s)]
*  Somebody else might get it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=132.12s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better if we owned that ourselves? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=133.84s)]
*  So here's Michael Cohen and Donald Trump in a recording that Cohen made without Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=136.68s)]
*  knowing in a meeting in Trump's office. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=141.32s)]
*  I've spoken to Alan Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up with funding. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  So what are we going to pay? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=154.44000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=157.44000000000003s)]
*  And it's all the stuff. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=158.44000000000003s)]
*  You've got to think it over. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=159.44000000000003s)]
*  All the stuff. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=160.44000000000003s)]
*  Because you never know where that company, you never know where he's going to be. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=161.44000000000003s)]
*  No pay gets you invited. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  So I'm all over that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=166.44000000000003s)]
*  And I spoke to Alan about it when it comes time for the financing, which will be. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  Who are you going to finance it? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, I have to pay you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=172.44000000000003s)]
*  No, I'll pay with cash. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=174.44000000000003s)]
*  I got, no, no, no. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=175.44000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=176.52s)]
*  Check. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=177.52s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=178.52s)]
*  Not cash. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Check. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Why check? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring into the conversation our colleague Lisa Rubin, who is at the courthouse today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  Also Catherine Christian, former assistant district attorney at the Manhattan DA's office. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=187.16s)]
*  Thank you, Ms. Christian, for being with us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=190.4s)]
*  Lisa, let me ask you, first of all, if I characterized the context of that recording correctly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=192.12s)]
*  And when they say Pecker might get hit by a truck, what they mean is Pecker might no longer [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=199.6s)]
*  be the custodian of what we believe is negative information about Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=204.94s)]
*  So we should own that ourselves. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=208.42s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  Why does or is it clear to you why it matters that Trump is suggesting making this payment [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  in cash, even though Cohen argues against that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=217.22s)]
*  Well, for starters, Trump doesn't want a record of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=222.54s)]
*  The exact same reasons that Cohen is saying, let's cut a check because I want to protect [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=225.66s)]
*  Trump with a record is the very same reason that Donald Trump is begging him to use cash, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=229.98s)]
*  because he wants no one to know about it at all. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=234.74s)]
*  But I think the larger import of the tape is not about the cash or check. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  It's about situating Donald Trump at the center of this scheme and showing that not only did [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=241.74s)]
*  he join the conspiracy, but that he was involved in each and every plan to execute on that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=246.5s)]
*  conspiracy by repaying for Karen McDougall's settlement on one hand and then later on paying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  Stormy Daniels himself. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=258.26s)]
*  When you talk about paying for something in a way that is untraceable or communicating [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=259.98s)]
*  about something in a way that is untraceable, is that to a jury or to a court of law? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  Is that potentially evidence of knowledge of criminality? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=273.74s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  But again, let's remember that here what the actual crime that's being alleged here is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  falsification of business records. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=282.14000000000004s)]
*  And so this tape doesn't necessarily move the needle about the falsification and Donald [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=283.98s)]
*  own knowledge and involvement in that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=289.3s)]
*  On the other hand, it shows his motive to be involved in that cover up because he was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  directly involved in the crime itself. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=299.7s)]
*  OK, so it's not that this so this goes to a larger point that we've been talking about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=300.7s)]
*  tonight, all of us, which is that there is no viable if the prosecution is doing its [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=305.26s)]
*  job, there is no viable counter narrative that Michael Cohen was acting alone, that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=310.38s)]
*  Trump had no idea any of this was happening. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=316.78s)]
*  Rather, the prosecution is presenting a picture of Michael Cohen's actions as situated in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=318.94s)]
*  and connected to and integral with Trump's own actions. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  Right, Catherine? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=329.02s)]
*  And it also goes to intent. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=330.02s)]
*  And the judge is going to instruct the jury that the definition of intent, it was the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=331.73999999999995s)]
*  defendant's conscious objective to cause a result. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=335.46s)]
*  So motive, intent, consciousness of guilt. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=338.9s)]
*  What gets me about this relationship, it wasn't an attorney-client relationship. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  It was a master servant. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=345.41999999999996s)]
*  No offense to Mr. Cohen. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=347.14s)]
*  So of course these weren't legal expenses because this was not really an attorney. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=348.38s)]
*  I mean, the prosecution will probably not argue that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=351.73999999999995s)]
*  But this really was not an attorney-client relationship. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=354.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  Again, we keep coming back to this idea that you don't, you know, that the burden of proof [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  correctly constitutionally is on the prosecution. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=363.62s)]
*  I just feel like and again, maybe I'm thinking of this in a way that it's not the median [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  juror because I'm exposed in a different way to it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=370.34s)]
*  I do need something to hang on to that's an alternate story for all this stuff. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=373.26s)]
*  I mean, you can raise doubts about it, but I mean like in order to empathize with the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  defense, in order to think that it wasn't exactly what it looks like. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=381.26s)]
*  I guess I just sort of feel like, OK, let's say you gave me some theory that Cohen went [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  rogue. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=390.58s)]
*  This was cooked up by Weisselberg and Cohen. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=391.58s)]
*  Like maybe that seems plausible and they wanted to do it for the boss. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=393.02s)]
*  But then like I need something about why Trump writes in the checks, right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  I can give it to you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=401.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=402.86s)]
*  But it's not very strong. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=403.86s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=404.86s)]
*  If you admit the misdemeanor. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=405.86s)]
*  Yeah, business fraud. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=407.98s)]
*  It's on paper. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=410.22s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=411.22s)]
*  CFO. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=412.22s)]
*  You lied. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=413.22s)]
*  But you say when Cohen did all this and the defendant is sitting in the White House, he [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=414.22s)]
*  then felt like paying him back. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=419.06s)]
*  So it's partly the rogue. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=420.74s)]
*  But it's all after the fact. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=421.82s)]
*  If you move the decision, which is still bad, later after the fact, you might, and tell [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=423.12s)]
*  us what you think, help raise doubt against whether it was contemporaneously consciousness [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=428.02s)]
*  intent at the time before Election Day, which means again, I'm not here doing free legal [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=433.82s)]
*  service. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=438.62s)]
*  They already have their plan, which means you admit the misdemeanor, which is a common [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=439.62s)]
*  defense tactic when you have a bad case, then you post date the other action. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=443.32s)]
*  And that allows for the fact that it could be true that you reimbursed it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  And will Donald Trump allow his defense attorneys to say, Your Honor, we want you to instruct [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=452.18s)]
*  the jury on the lesser included offense of falsifying business records in the second [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=456.94s)]
*  degree. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=460.7s)]
*  Don't you think that would be in New York? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=461.7s)]
*  That would be allow his lawyers to essentially plead guilty to the misdemeanor. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=462.7s)]
*  Well, not plead guilty. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=465.62s)]
*  You're just admitting it basically. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=466.62s)]
*  And then he would be again, assuming the jury says, you know what, we don't think it's, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=469.46s)]
*  you know, the higher we don't we don't know where the intent to conceal another crime [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=474.14s)]
*  is. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=477.65999999999997s)]
*  But he did intend to defraud. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  But don't you think there's 34 misdemeanor convictions as opposed to felonies? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  But don't you think if you have a defendant who's not consumed by ego, that's a better [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=482.86s)]
*  instruction? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=487.38s)]
*  I would give my client the client. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=488.38s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=490.82s)]
*  If this had been me, I would have pled guilty day one and it would all be over by now. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=492.58000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=496.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFR_0zl1lRU&t=497.22s)]
