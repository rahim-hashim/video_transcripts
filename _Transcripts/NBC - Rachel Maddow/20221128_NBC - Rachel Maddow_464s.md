# Republican Leader Trump's Dinner With Racist Forces Reckoning For Normal Americans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I)
*  We've got the leading presidential contender for the Republican nomination in 2024. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=0.0s)]
*  This holiday weekend, having a nice Thanksgiving dinner with Kanye West, the rapper who just [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  lost all of his corporate sponsorship deals when he started saying he was going to go [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=11.0s)]
*  DEATH CON 3 on the Jews. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=15.0s)]
*  The leading Republican presidential candidate, their last president, Donald Trump, just hosted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=19.56s)]
*  Mr. West this weekend. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  And also this man for what was apparently a very nice Thanksgiving dinner at the former [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=25.8s)]
*  president's home. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=30.64s)]
*  When you look at these things like abortion, it's popular. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=31.64s)]
*  People like abortion, hate it, but it's true. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=37.02s)]
*  And you can thank the Jewish media for that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=40.3s)]
*  Abortion is popular, sodomy is popular, being gay is popular, being a feminist is popular, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=43.0s)]
*  sex out of wedlock is popular, contraceptives are popular. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=49.8s)]
*  It's all popular. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=52.08s)]
*  That's all. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=53.08s)]
*  That's not to say it's good. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=54.08s)]
*  That's not to say I like that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=55.16s)]
*  Popular means the people support it, which they do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=56.64s)]
*  And it sucks and it is what it is, but that's why we need a dictatorship. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=61.64s)]
*  That's unironically why we need to get rid of all that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=65.28s)]
*  We need to take control of the media or take control of the government and force the people [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=67.84s)]
*  to believe what we believe. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=71.52s)]
*  That's why we need a dictatorship. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Force people to believe what we believe. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=77.68s)]
*  We need a dictatorship, unironically. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  So that clip is from People for the American Way. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=81.72s)]
*  They have a project called Right Wing Watch, where they monitor and document what's going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=84.02s)]
*  on on the ultra right, on the far right fringe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  And that's a great public service all of the time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=92.06s)]
*  I'll tell you, it becomes a fire alarm system for the whole country when someone from that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=93.94s)]
*  fringe, someone from that far out on the political spectrum, ends up having a Thanksgiving dinner [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=98.44s)]
*  with the Republican Party's leading candidate for president. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=104.38s)]
*  Here's the pathway. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=109.02s)]
*  We have one more election where white people can make the decision. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=110.46s)]
*  The white people got to make the right decision and then Trump's got to get in there and never leave. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  That, to me at this point, is a pathway. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  It's time to shut up, elect Trump one more time, and then stop having elections. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=119.7s)]
*  We have got to talk about the fundamentals of our worldview and what it would look like [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=126.5s)]
*  to build a society based on our distinct worldview. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=132.8s)]
*  It looks like a society where women don't have the right to vote. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=136.46s)]
*  It looks like a society where boys and girls get married as teenagers and start having [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=139.52s)]
*  kids and they don't use birth control and they don't use contraceptives and they have [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=145.4s)]
*  big families and a high birth rate. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  And it looks like women wearing veils at church and it looks like women not being in the workforce. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Banning gay marriage is back on the menu. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=160.12s)]
*  Banning sodomy is back on the menu. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Banning contraceptives is back on the menu. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=166.32s)]
*  And basically we're having something like Taliban rule in America in a good way. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=170.32s)]
*  We're having something like a Catholic Taliban rule in America. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=176.88s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=181.56s)]
*  You know, enough with the Jim Crow stuff. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=182.56s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, they had to drink out of a different water fountain. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Big f***ing deal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  Oh no, they had to go to a different school. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  Their water fountain in that famous picture was worse. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=192.8s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  Grow up, drink out of the f***ing water fountain. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  It's water. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=198.72s)]
*  It's the same. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=199.72s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=200.72s)]
*  And, you know, even if it was bad. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=201.72s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  It's better. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  It's better in general. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  We all agree. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  It's better. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  It's better. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  Jim Crow segregation, it was better. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  Almost all of that was posted by People for the American Way, their project Right Wing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=213.08s)]
*  Watch, which monitors stuff like this on the far right, which is usually only of interest [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=216.8s)]
*  to people who study the far right, but it suddenly becomes totally relevant to everyone [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=221.64s)]
*  else in the country when a guy like that suddenly ends up invited to the home of the Republican [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  Party's leading presidential candidate to have a private Thanksgiving dinner with him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  That guy and former President Donald Trump, I should tell you, he is also a Holocaust [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  denier. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=244.27999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to show you those clips of him denying the Holocaust, but they're there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  He not only explicitly calls for the imposition of a dictatorship in this country, he's explicitly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=250.08s)]
*  praised Hitler. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  He says Jewish people should not be allowed to participate in the U.S. government. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=255.96s)]
*  And now he's having a nice private dinner with the man most likely to be the next Republican [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=260.2s)]
*  nominee for president of the United States. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, back to work on this split screen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, in politics, we've got sort of normal or normal-ish questions right now about [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=273.16s)]
*  what are the Democrats going to get done in the lame duck period and are they working [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=281.12s)]
*  enough of the days in the lame duck period? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=284.56s)]
*  Are they acting with enough urgency given that they're about to lose control of half [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  of Congress? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=290.16s)]
*  Will there be a government funding bill in time to avert another dumb government shutdown? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=291.32000000000005s)]
*  Will the House Republican leader get enough votes to become speaker on the first ballot? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  We've got all these sort of normal politics headlines here on Earth One, but it's all [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=299.72s)]
*  simultaneous and adjacent to the death con three on the Jews guy and the Holocaust denier [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=307.04s)]
*  eating turkey and stuffing with the leader of the Republican Party at his home. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=316.68s)]
*  And I feel like since this came to light over the holiday weekend, most of the talk in political [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=323.36s)]
*  circles has been about whether or not this is bad for Trump, whether or not this is going [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=328.48s)]
*  to reflect poorly on him as the leader of the Republican Party, whether this is something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  that might hurt him in some way, whether this might be a mistake for him or whether this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  will slide off him too. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=340.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  The reason groups like People for the American Way monitor guys like this and keep track [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=346.12s)]
*  of what they are saying and doing is not just because a guy like this might have an incidental [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=352.3s)]
*  effect someday on some real politician who interacts with them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=357.68s)]
*  The reason that it is worth keeping track of Holocaust denying racist agitators who [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=362.44s)]
*  advocate race war and, I kid you not, burning women alive in America, the reason you monitor [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=368.32s)]
*  guys like that is not just because of their potential future impact someday on other people [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=377.4s)]
*  who have power. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=381.96000000000004s)]
*  It's because of their power and because of the damage that they want to do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  And guys like that, neo-Nazi agitators getting a big proverbial hug, getting a private audience [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  with the Republican Party's likely next presidential nominee. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, sure, that reflects on that political candidate and on his party. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=397.24s)]
*  But more importantly, it's great for the Nazis, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=401.17999999999995s)]
*  It's a supercharging thing for them, for their perceived legitimacy, their reach, their ability [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  to get their message out to people, to operate, to recruit and to do what they want to do, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=411.40000000000003s)]
*  which in this guy's case is turning the United States of America into a whites-only, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=415.64s)]
*  no-Jews-allowed fascist homeland under a dictator who he would please like to be Donald Trump. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=420.12s)]
*  It is hard to have regular, everyday, normal politics alongside this kind of politics too, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  but that's where we are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=435.6s)]
*  And the violent ultra-right will benefit greatly from this moment, whether or not any right-wing [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=437.12s)]
*  politicians do as well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osc_tAy_Z_I&t=442.2s)]
