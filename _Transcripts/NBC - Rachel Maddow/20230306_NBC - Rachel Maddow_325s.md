# With Trump in legal trouble, Georgia GOP targets prosecutors
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g)
*  What happens when the dear leader and his party decide that if the legal system is going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=0.0s)]
*  to be used against the dear leader, then the legal system has got to go? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=4.84s)]
*  What happens when you take it further, when you take it beyond criticizing the legal system? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=9.48s)]
*  You take it beyond criticizing those who are investigating you, and you instead decide [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=14.64s)]
*  the system has got to go? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=20.2s)]
*  I mean, we know what this looks like in other countries. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=22.6s)]
*  What does it look like here? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=26.48s)]
*  Would anyone try that here in the United States in our era, in our time? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=28.92s)]
*  Well, here's tonight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Here's on the front page of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution right now as we speak. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=36.32s)]
*  Quote, Republicans demand oversight of prosecutors amid Trump probe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=40.56s)]
*  Here's part of the lead from reporter Greg Blustein at the AJC. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  Quote, the Georgia House tonight approved a measure to create a new state board that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=51.2s)]
*  could punish or oust district attorneys. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=55.36s)]
*  The latest step in an ongoing campaign by Republicans to exert oversight over prosecutors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=58.64s)]
*  they see as skirting their duties. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  The measure passed the House 98 to 75 today over the objections of Democrats and prominent [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=65.76s)]
*  prosecutors, among them Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis, who is leading an ongoing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=71.12s)]
*  probe of Donald Trump. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=75.76s)]
*  Republicans have rallied around the overhaul as a way to rein in, quote, rogue prosecutors. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=77.68s)]
*  Powerful Republicans have put it on the fast track. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=82.92s)]
*  The Georgia Senate has passed a similar version of this legislation, and the overall effort [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=85.52s)]
*  is backed by both Governor Brian Kemp and Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  I should mention Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones in Georgia is one of the people who's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=96.36s)]
*  been notified by the Fulton County District Attorney's Office that he himself is a target [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  for potential prosecution in the investigation into Trump's efforts to throw out the election [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=105.6s)]
*  results in Georgia and have election results in that state falsely declare him the winner. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=110.36s)]
*  The Lieutenant Governor is facing potential charges himself in that investigation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=115.24s)]
*  He and at least one Republican state senator who's also facing potential charges in that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  investigation turns out they are strong supporters of this new measure that would give Republicans [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  in the legislature effectively the power to remove prosecutors that they don't like. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=129.9s)]
*  Facing criminal charges? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=136.32s)]
*  How about you vote yourself the power to fire the person who's going to charge you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=137.76s)]
*  The former president himself, Donald Trump, as of today is urging Republicans in Georgia [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=145.24s)]
*  that they must pass this legislation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=154.0s)]
*  So Republicans will have the power to remove prosecutors in the middle of their investigations [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=157.24s)]
*  and in the middle of prosecuting any particular case that Republicans might not like for any [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  reason. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  And to be clear, this has now passed the Georgia legislature as of tonight. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  A version of this bill passed the state Senate and the House just passed it tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=173.32s)]
*  And the Republican governor there, Brian Kemp, he says he will sign it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=178.16s)]
*  He is a strong supporter of this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=181.68s)]
*  So they're doing it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=183.56s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe this would be easier to see if it were happening in another country. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=187.36s)]
*  And you know, maybe the leader of their party is still going to face criminal charges in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=194.56s)]
*  other jurisdictions where he is under criminal investigation, like federally where he's under [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=199.4s)]
*  criminal investigation or in New York state where he's under criminal investigation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=203.2s)]
*  Maybe he will. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Maybe he won't. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  None of us know. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  But in the one place where he is under criminal investigation and his party is in full control [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  of the state government, they have just decided for the first time in that state's history [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  that it is now for the first time within their own power to remove prosecutors in the middle [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=217.6s)]
*  of their duties on their own say so. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  And yes, this is a story about Georgia. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  And yes, this is a story about Trump and the potential charges he's facing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=228.6s)]
*  But this is a whole new step for us as a country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=232.28s)]
*  This is a new thing for us as a democracy. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=235.52s)]
*  This is not ranting against the investigators. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=239.0s)]
*  We've seen that before. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  And calling people names and even picking off individuals in the law enforcement system [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=242.56s)]
*  to try to turn them into enemies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=247.34s)]
*  As bad as that all is, we have seen all of that before. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=249.52s)]
*  This is not just trying to verbally and politically delegitimize the investigating entities. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=253.22s)]
*  Those are all very bad things to do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=258.64s)]
*  But this is more. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=260.32s)]
*  Sticks and stones, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=262.35999999999996s)]
*  But this is dismantling the way the legal system works. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=264.11999999999995s)]
*  So presumably it can no longer work against him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  This isn't a resolution denouncing a prosecutor who might bring charges against Donald Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=276.11999999999995s)]
*  This is giving Republicans, this is Republicans voting to give themselves the power to remove [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  a prosecutor who acts in a way that they do not like, as she is on the precipice of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=286.62s)]
*  potentially bringing charges against him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=290.74s)]
*  This passed the Georgia state legislature tonight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=295.22s)]
*  It will soon be on its way to the governor. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=297.14s)]
*  For Georgia, yes, but for us as a country, this is a benchmark moment. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=300.48s)]
*  This is new. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ypWIedc2g&t=304.2s)]
