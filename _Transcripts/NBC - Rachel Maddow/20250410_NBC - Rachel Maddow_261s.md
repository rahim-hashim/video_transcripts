Video Description: Rachel Maddow highlights a problem lawyers who work for the Trump administration are having a hard time reconciling: The honesty and truthful testimony required by courts of law are incompatible with the bad faith arguments behind the Trump policies that are being taken to court. Lawyers who don't tow the Trump line are fired, but lawyers who lie in court risk permanent damage to their careers.

# Truth or Trump?: Administration lawyers face impossible task trying to defend Trump without lying
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg)
*  This pattern, this kind of thing in court has been happening again and again and again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's starting to have a really interesting consequence. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=8.08s)]
*  For weeks now, we have just—we have seen this pattern emerging. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=10.76s)]
*  You've got lawyers representing the Trump administration who are being forced, effectively, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  to present arguments that either aren't truthful or don't make sense in court. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=17.8s)]
*  And when they try to pull that off in open court, they face questioning from judges. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  And the judges immediately suss out that what the lawyers are trying to defend is indefensible [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=29.72s)]
*  or obviously untrue. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=35.12s)]
*  And so, again and again and again, you're seeing Trump administration lawyers basically [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=36.64s)]
*  being thumbtacked to the back wall of the courtroom by one judge after another. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=40.64s)]
*  And it has produced these incredible headlines. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Headline. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=47.32s)]
*  Is that really how you think this all works? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=49.08s)]
*  Outraged judge repeatedly mocks DOJ lawyers, tears into them for being unprepared. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Headline. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=56.96s)]
*  Judge in Alien Enemies Act case chides DOJ lawyer over refusal to answer key questions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=58.12s)]
*  Headline. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=64.0s)]
*  Judge snaps at Trump administration lawyers for gaslighting. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=65.0s)]
*  And again, this is just an untenable situation these lawyers are being put in, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=68.64s)]
*  You have to be truthful to a judge. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=75.32s)]
*  You have to be truthful to the court as a lawyer who's standing there in front of the judge. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  But being truthful in this administration is seen as a betrayal of Donald Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=83.68s)]
*  So what are these lawyers supposed to do, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=88.12s)]
*  You literally cannot lie to a judge and stay a lawyer. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=89.92s)]
*  But telling the truth to a judge in so many of these cases, not only is it not going to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  win you the case, it helps prove the point that the administration is losing all of these [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=99.04s)]
*  cases because they keep doing things that are really blatantly illegal, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  And if you lose the case in court or you lose that day's proceeding in court because you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=112.16s)]
*  told the judge the truth, well, that's cause for firing in Donald Trump's Justice Department. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=117.16s)]
*  So what are you supposed to do? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=121.96s)]
*  I mean, honestly, the answer is obvious, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=126.72s)]
*  Ethically, you can see, whether or not you're a lawyer, right, you can see what you would [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=130.76s)]
*  do and what you should do if you were a lawyer in this case. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=134.04s)]
*  You just do the right thing, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=137.0s)]
*  You zealously represent your client, yes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=138.0s)]
*  But you always tell the truth. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=140.56s)]
*  If you do that as a Trump administration lawyer, you will get fired for it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=144.76s)]
*  And so now we're seeing people get fired for it and their supervisors get fired too. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=152.04s)]
*  And all the Justice Department lawyers who are seeing that pattern emerge are sitting [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=156.68s)]
*  there thinking, do I want to lie to a judge and therefore be exiled from the legal profession? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=162.4s)]
*  Or do I want to not lie to a judge and get fired from the Trump administration? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=170.28s)]
*  Those are my choices. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=175.24s)]
*  What else can I do? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=176.24s)]
*  And so they're all quitting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=180.08s)]
*  We are now seeing this untenable situation reach its natural mathematical conclusion [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  in a pretty dramatic way. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=187.0s)]
*  The Washington Post is now reporting that at least half of the frontline lawyers in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=188.36s)]
*  the Solicitor General's office are either preparing to leave or have announced their [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  departures already. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=196.84s)]
*  What's the Solicitor General's office? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  That's the office that specifically argues cases for the administration in front of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=199.96s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=204.6s)]
*  A majority of their lawyers have now quit or are quitting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=205.6s)]
*  Quote, many of the lawyers leaving the office are uncomfortable or turned off by directives [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=210.6s)]
*  from Justice Department leaders. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=214.84s)]
*  Again, the reporting here is that at least half of the lawyers whose job it is to defend [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=216.8s)]
*  Donald Trump at the Supreme Court, a majority of the office that has that responsibility [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=223.16s)]
*  has now quit or is about to quit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=228.44s)]
*  That seems like a bad sign. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=233.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=235.16s)]
*  Seems like a bad sign in terms of what this administration is up to. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=236.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCU2DvaAkDg&t=253.16s)]
