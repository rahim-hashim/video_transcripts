Video Description: Perennially sketchy Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is facing impeachment at the hands of his own party. Having already been impeached by the state House, Paxton faces a trial in the senate, over which Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will preside as judge. Ahead of the trial, Paxton's PAC donated three million dollars to Patrick, who is not up for reelection until 2026. Rachel Maddow lays it out.

# Unbelievable: Texas A.G.’s PAC makes donation to Lt. Gov. presiding over his impeachment trial
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M)
*  This is an amazing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't believe this is real. It's real. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=2.0s)]
*  This is the Republican Attorney General of Texas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=4.0s)]
*  His name is Ken Paxton. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=6.0s)]
*  Although he is not currently serving as Attorney General [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=8.0s)]
*  because he has been suspended from office [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=10.0s)]
*  by the Texas Legislature pending an impeachment trial. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=12.0s)]
*  Now how bad do things have to be [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=16.0s)]
*  for the Republicans in the Texas Legislature [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=18.0s)]
*  to impeach their own Republican Attorney General? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, where do we start? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=24.0s)]
*  Almost the entire time he's been Attorney General [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=26.0s)]
*  he's been under indictment for felony securities fraud. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=28.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, he's facing potential disbarment [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=31.0s)]
*  from the practice of law entirely [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=33.0s)]
*  over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=35.0s)]
*  Also, he's under criminal investigation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=39.0s)]
*  by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=41.0s)]
*  Allegations so serious that eight high-ranking officials [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=44.0s)]
*  in his own office went to the FBI [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=48.0s)]
*  to report what they had witnessed in his office. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=51.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multimillion dollar [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=54.0s)]
*  high-time million dollar settlement in a lawsuit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=57.0s)]
*  for allegedly firing several of those officials [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=59.0s)]
*  as retaliation for them going to the FBI. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=62.0s)]
*  It has been a lot with this guy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=65.0s)]
*  But hilariously, it was only when Paxton demanded [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=68.0s)]
*  that Texas taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=71.0s)]
*  to pay that settlement that Republicans in the Legislature [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=75.0s)]
*  finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=78.0s)]
*  The Texas House impeached Ken Paxton by an overwhelming margin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=81.0s)]
*  So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=85.0s)]
*  They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=88.0s)]
*  If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=91.0s)]
*  he will lose his job permanently. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=93.0s)]
*  Now, here's where it gets amazing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=95.0s)]
*  That trial will be presided over by the president of the Senate, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=97.0s)]
*  the lieutenant governor of the state, a man named Dan Patrick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=101.0s)]
*  As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=104.0s)]
*  he'll have immense power. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=107.0s)]
*  He'll be the ultimate arbiter of, like, the rules [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=109.0s)]
*  and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=112.0s)]
*  Here's the thing I can't believe is real, but it is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=115.0s)]
*  So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding judge in this impeachment trial, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=118.0s)]
*  just had to release his new campaign finance report. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=123.0s)]
*  And would you look at that? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=127.0s)]
*  He just received $3 million from the Ken Paxton super PAC. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=129.0s)]
*  Wow, what a coincidence. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=137.0s)]
*  Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=139.0s)]
*  All he has coming up is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=143.0s)]
*  And here's the PAC for the defendant in that impeachment trial [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=148.0s)]
*  dumping $3 million on his porch. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=153.0s)]
*  Just ahead of the trial. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=157.0s)]
*  Wow, everything is bigger in Texas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=160.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNQ0hB7zi8M&t=164.0s)]
