# Trump accidentally builds broad coalition of opponents energized by his unpopular agenda
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU)
*  NOAA is 12,000 experts here to help, to fly into hurricanes, to deploy underwater sensors, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=0.0s)]
*  to train models predicting tomorrow or 2100. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=9.92s)]
*  We need to let NOAA's staff continue its mission. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=13.44s)]
*  We need to let them continue delivering. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=16.56s)]
*  That was Dr. Sarah Cooley. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=25.92s)]
*  Until recently, she was a scientist at NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=27.28s)]
*  which is the part of the federal government that does little things that anybody can do, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  tracking hurricanes and tornadoes and tsunamis, stuff you can do at home. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=37.0s)]
*  Hundreds of scientists like Dr. Cooley were fired from NOAA last week, part of Trump and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=43.0s)]
*  his top campaign donor, indiscriminately eliminating whole parts of the US government, especially [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=46.88s)]
*  the parts we use. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=52.02s)]
*  Dr. Cooley, along with about a thousand other former NOAA employees and supporters and just [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=54.04s)]
*  members of the public and Democratic members of Congress and the US Senate, all stood outside [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=58.44s)]
*  NOAA headquarters today, just outside DC, to protest all those firings, to protest those [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  weather forecasters and scientists who have just been fired from their jobs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  They held up signs that said, save NOAA, firing the scientists creates a bleep storm. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=72.6s)]
*  There was also another protest in DC today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  This was to defend the federal government as well, just a few miles down the road. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=82.7s)]
*  This one was for employees for the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  Employees there were ordered by the White House to stop all of their work. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=92.68s)]
*  They held this rally not at CFPB headquarters, but outside the federal courthouse in DC, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  where a court fight is underway, challenging the legality of that stop work order. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=101.5s)]
*  This crowd gathered today outside the McPherson Square metro station in DC. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=106.86s)]
*  It's the closest metro stop to the White House. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=110.86s)]
*  It's also right near the headquarters of the VA Veterans Affairs. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=113.18s)]
*  These protesters were there to support all the people who are still employed by the US [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=117.66s)]
*  government and people who are employed, especially at the VA, people just holding up signs and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=122.5s)]
*  applauding for them, thanking them on their way to work. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  The signs they're holding say, federal workers are heroes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=133.58s)]
*  This was all today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=136.42000000000002s)]

*  upside down flag. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=332.7s)]
*  We not only saw it again in Colorado this weekend, we also saw it at Joshua Tree National [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=334.14s)]
*  Park in California and off the second flat iron in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=338.54s)]
*  So lots and lots going on this weekend. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=345.54s)]
*  The American people are making themselves heard. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=347.94s)]
*  They are showing up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=350.32s)]
*  Also this weekend, the vice president decided to take a vacation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=351.72s)]
*  He brought his family to Wakesfield, Vermont this weekend to go skiing at Sugarbush, waiting [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=357.0s)]
*  for him at the ski resort. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=362.14s)]
*  Were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of angry Vermonters telling them how much they [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=363.92s)]
*  support Ukraine and how much they do not support JD Vance, especially after his insulting display [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=370.58s)]
*  of Russian talking points in the Oval Office with the president of Ukraine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=378.22s)]
*  Some of these signs are very memorable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=383.6s)]
*  JD Vance, Zelensky is 10 times the man you are. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=386.36s)]
*  This one we saw a number of different iterations of this one this weekend. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=390.26s)]
*  Vance is a traitor. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  Go ski in Russia. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=394.0s)]
*  Also I do not ski, so I assume this is some cardinal sin of the slopes. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=396.0s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=400.38s)]
*  It says Vance skis in jeans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=401.38s)]
*  Again, I do not know, but it sounds bad. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=403.38s)]
*  It was not just Vermont that showed their support for Ukraine. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=407.42s)]
*  There were tons of actually pro-Ukraine anti-Russia anti-Trump anti-Vance protests all over the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=410.82s)]
*  weekend. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=417.4s)]
*  We've got more on that ahead with a live report from our Pentagon correspondent coming up [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=418.4s)]
*  as we're starting to absorb this news that the U.S. is not only dropping sanctions against [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=422.48s)]
*  Russia and cutting off all aid to Ukraine, but also ordering a U.S. military cyber command [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=427.62s)]
*  stand down in all of its operations against Russia. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oSbsMn2uU&t=433.3s)]
