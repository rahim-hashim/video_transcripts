# Maddow: No accident Trump's courtroom chaos makes a mockery of the legal system
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI)
*  Donald Trump, you may have heard, today took the stand as a witness in the quarter-billion-dollar [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=0.0s)]
*  civil trial in which he and his business are accused of years of massive financial fraud. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=5.9s)]
*  His testimony was chaotic and rambling by all accounts. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=12.64s)]
*  Legal observers broadly today said his testimony likely undercut his own lawyer's defense strategy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=17.66s)]
*  in terms of the provable allegations in this case and the amount of distance his lawyers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=23.44s)]
*  have been trying to put between him and the financial statements that are at issue in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=28.28s)]
*  this fraud case. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=32.52s)]
*  But you know, the sort of chaotic, insulting, non-sequitur character of his testimony today [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=36.08s)]
*  may not help with the sort of black-letter law of this civil fraud case that he's facing, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  but it does have a larger point for him, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=50.32s)]
*  The chaotic, rambling, non-sequitur, out-of-control, insulting, sort of unprofessional, inappropriate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=53.56s)]
*  testimony may not help with his case, but it does make a mockery of the legal system, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=61.32s)]
*  right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=68.2s)]
*  It does implicitly, at least, and explicitly, according to some of his testimony today, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=69.2s)]
*  show that he's trying to denigrate and discredit and delegitimize not just this case against [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=74.72s)]
*  him and his company, but the whole legal system, the whole court system. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=80.72s)]
*  That does appear to be his larger goal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  And it makes sense, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=86.16s)]
*  When your legal troubles include a couple of huge civil cases and 91 felony criminal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  counts against you, one way to fight that is to fight each of the civil suits and each [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  of the 91 felony charges on the substance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=99.78s)]
*  Sure, you could do that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=102.12s)]
*  The easier path, though, the more efficient path, is just to run against the legal system, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=103.32s)]
*  to tell your followers that the American legal system, the American system of justice [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=108.32s)]
*  and law enforcement and the judiciary and the court, it's all illegitimate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  And your followers should see it as illegitimate, too, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  Tell your followers you don't intend to follow the rules of the legal system, and they shouldn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=123.3s)]
*  either. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=127.56s)]
*  Delegitimizing the legal system, delegitimizing and trying to discredit the independent judiciary [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=130.56s)]
*  in the court system is, of course, the most important step toward dissolving the legal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=135.84s)]
*  system in the court system or trying to turn it into something unrecognizable in a democracy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=140.84s)]
*  We're going to talk with Washington Post reporter Devlin Barrett tonight about his new reporting, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=148.08s)]
*  about the planning that's underway on the right for what to do to the U.S. legal system [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=152.76s)]
*  if Trump or another Republican is elected president next year. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=158.76s)]
*  Really chilling reporting from Devlin Barrett and his colleagues at the Washington Post. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=163.4s)]
*  We're going to have Devlin Barrett here live coming up this hour. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=166.96s)]
*  But you know, you might have seen the big political news in the last 48 hours was the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=170.4s)]
*  New York Times-Siena College polling that came out this weekend about the presidential [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=177.24s)]
*  race. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=180.8s)]
*  And the headline there was that President Biden's reelection effort looks like it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=181.8s)]
*  in trouble. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=185.6s)]
*  Trump is ahead of Biden in a hypothetical general election matchup in five of six so-called [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=186.6s)]
*  battleground states. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=192.06s)]
*  Interestingly though, even in that poll, those results flip when people are asked about Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=194.94s)]
*  potentially being convicted of any of the felonies he's currently charged with. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=200.82s)]
*  In that same poll, all six of those six swing states would go for Biden if Trump is convicted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=206.02s)]
*  on any count in any of his trials. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=212.12s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  But you see how central this is to Trump's effort to try to get back into the White House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=217.24s)]
*  It's a chicken and egg thing in terms of why he wants to get there, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=221.8s)]
*  And what convictions have to be seen as by his followers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  But you see why his effort is to try to not necessarily beat all of these charges and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=229.84s)]
*  all of these civil suits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  It's to say that the legal system doesn't matter and the legal system isn't in power [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=236.86s)]
*  and the legal system doesn't need to be obeyed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sacLoleyaPI&t=241.8s)]
