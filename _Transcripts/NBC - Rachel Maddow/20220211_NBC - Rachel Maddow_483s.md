# Florida Republicans Move Toward Abortion Ban With New Proposed Restrictions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA)
*  Oklahoma's legislative session started back up this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=0.0s)]
*  The lawmakers are considering a slate of anti-abortion measures, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=3.44s)]
*  including one bill that would create a database of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=6.48s)]
*  pregnant people in the state seeking an abortion, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=9.16s)]
*  and another measure that would ban abortion [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  after 30 days since a missed period. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=14.52s)]
*  Thirty days, that's sooner than many women know that they are pregnant, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=16.8s)]
*  and it's definitely sooner than many people decide if they want to seek abortion care. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=20.16s)]
*  Over in New Hampshire, the state house debated a bill that would allow [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=24.48s)]
*  any man who claims to be the father to sue a woman seeking an abortion, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=28.12s)]
*  and ultimately force her to keep the pregnancy even against her will. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=33.52s)]
*  One state house Republican explained, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=37.28s)]
*  quote, it's actually about recognizing that men have the rights, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=39.24s)]
*  fathers have some rights, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=42.2s)]
*  but how do we go about making sure those rights are recognized? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=43.56s)]
*  End of quote. Well, this bill suggests lawmakers want to do that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=47.24s)]
*  by usurping a woman's control over her own body. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=50.6s)]
*  It's nothing short of alarming that any of these bills aren't being considered, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=53.92s)]
*  anywhere in the Democratic United States in which a constitution is guaranteed, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=58.04s)]
*  that an abortion is guaranteed by the constitution. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=62.68s)]
*  But if you want a better sense of the trend lines in this country, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=64.92s)]
*  when it comes to the reproductive rights, take a look at Florida. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=68.6s)]
*  Just a few months ago, Florida lawmakers were cooking up a bill that would imitate [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  the Texas vigilante law that effectively bans all abortion after six weeks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=75.88s)]
*  But since the Texas law has been kicked around from court to court, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=81.72s)]
*  Florida dropped that model in favor of a different kind of anti-abortion bill, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=84.56s)]
*  one that's more like Mississippi's law that bans abortion after 15 weeks [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=89.08s)]
*  and is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=94.08s)]
*  Florida Republicans are supportive of the new bill because they say that compared [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=97.16s)]
*  to the Texas law, which bans the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=101.0s)]
*  theirs is a whole 15 weeks, a time difference that they call generous. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=105.56s)]
*  According to Florida House Republican Dana Tribulsi, 15 weeks is, quote, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=112.2s)]
*  a long time, end quote, even if it's less than the 24-week time limit [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=118.28s)]
*  that Roe v. Wade guarantees for women to get an abortion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=122.96s)]
*  Florida Republicans say, hey, this bill's a compromise bill, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=126.32s)]
*  even though it provides no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=129.92s)]
*  incest, or human trafficking. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=133.4s)]
*  State Senator Kelly Stargill says, quote, we're not banning anything. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=135.8s)]
*  We're not being mean. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=139.16s)]
*  We're not being mean. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=140.96s)]
*  Chill out, guys. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=141.8s)]
*  It's generous, not mean. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=142.52s)]
*  The bill passed a Florida Senate committee last week. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=144.68s)]
*  A state House committee, subcommittee, advanced the bill earlier this week. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=147.0s)]
*  The state House Health and Human Services Committee held its first hearing on the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=150.88s)]
*  bill on Thursday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=154.88s)]
*  Now, they asked for public testimony. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=157.0s)]
*  When it came time for public testimony, several Florida residents had a lot to say [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  about this generous bill. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=163.28s)]
*  It is so exhausting trying to find new ways to beg you to hear my pleas, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=165.04s)]
*  to protect my right to choose. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=170.04s)]
*  There should be no room, no right for anyone, especially any politician, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=171.92s)]
*  and more specifically, any male politician, to interfere in that very intimate moment [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  and tell a woman what to do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=183.72s)]
*  As a woman of color, a wife, and a mom of three, this bill is taking away the access [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=185.2s)]
*  and choice that people in this state should respectfully have. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  I drove two and a half hours this morning from my college town in Gainesville to ask [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=193.36s)]
*  you why. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=196.96s)]
*  Why do you feel the need to make decisions on women's bodies? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=197.96s)]
*  Outlawing and further restricting abortion by passing this bill would not bring wellness [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=200.96s)]
*  to the people of Florida. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=204.56s)]
*  15 weeks is an undue burden. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=205.96s)]
*  I was raped my freshman year of college. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Afterwards, I felt like no matter what I did, I didn't have agency or control over my own [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=212.96s)]
*  body, and that's how I feel again today sitting in this room. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  It's really not your business. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=219.56s)]
*  and wants to have an abortion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  What should be your business is providing health care, housing, therapy, and child care [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  for expecting parents. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=227.16s)]
*  Please vote now on HB5. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Even after all that testimony, the committee voted to advance the bill. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  Now it's going to go to the full House for consideration on Tuesday. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=233.96s)]
*  Democrats say they will oppose it, but they are, as we have discussed several times on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=237.56s)]
*  this show, in the minority. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=241.56s)]
*  Joining us now is the Florida State Representative, Ana Escamani, a Democrat who opposes the bill [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=242.96s)]
*  that the House will vote on next week. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=248.36s)]
*  Representative Escamani, good to see you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=251.16000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for joining us again tonight. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=253.56s)]
*  What can happen here? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=255.56s)]
*  This is another situation in which Florida Republicans have a plan and they've got the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=257.16s)]
*  numbers. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  So what does your sustained fight look like? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, Ali, there's no such thing as a generous or reasonable abortion ban. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=267.56s)]
*  This is complete gaslighted by Republican Congress. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=272.56s)]
*  This is complete gaslighted by Republican colleagues who will do anything to ban abortion, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=275.76s)]
*  even if it takes them step by step, bill by bill. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=281.76s)]
*  This is a dangerous agenda that would force those seeking to access an abortion beyond [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=284.76s)]
*  15 weeks in Florida to go to North Carolina as their closest option, assuming North Carolina [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=289.76s)]
*  doesn't ban abortion as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=295.76s)]
*  And of course, as Democrats and minority, our options are to fight like hell, to do [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=296.76s)]
*  what we can to not only delay the passage of this bill, but to, of course, amplify public [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=301.96s)]
*  attention. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=306.96s)]
*  The reality is that Republicans know that banning abortion is not popular in Florida, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=307.96s)]
*  and that's why they continuously try to avoid calling this what it is, a ban on abortion. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=311.96s)]
*  So you mentioned this idea that some people may have to go to North Carolina. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=316.96s)]
*  Let's spell out the reality of this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=320.96s)]
*  There were a lot of women who testified there who said, look, this is a hardship. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=322.96s)]
*  This is difficult. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=327.96s)]
*  But that's the goal, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=328.96s)]
*  The goal is to make abortions inaccessible, particularly for people who do not have the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  luxury of traveling to states and extra gas and housing and waiting periods and tests [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  that are not necessary. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  But that's actually the intent of this bill. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  First of all, abortion access is already highly restricted in Florida, as we're seeing that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  trend in conservative states across America. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And the reality is that abortion bans impact every type of person. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  As you mentioned, those who have access to means will find a way to express bodily autonomy, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=358.36s)]
*  have that agency, and decide the outcome of their pregnancy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=363.36s)]
*  It's going to be those of no wealth, those who are people of color, undocumented, folks [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=367.36s)]
*  with disabilities, minors, folks who live in foster care. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=373.36s)]
*  These are going to be the populations of Floridians who will truly have no other alternative [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=376.36s)]
*  and are going to be either forced to travel out of state or forced to become parents, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=381.36s)]
*  which they know they're not ready or they don't wish to pursue. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=386.56s)]
*  And so we're locking people deeper into poverty. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=389.56s)]
*  There's already so much research that helps us understand what happens when someone cannot [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=391.56s)]
*  make a personal decision about their pregnancy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=396.56s)]
*  The outcomes are dangerous. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=398.56s)]
*  The outcomes are systematically brutal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=400.56s)]
*  And this really is a bill that tries to punish poor people for being poor. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=402.56s)]
*  You did tweet that your House Democrats have filed 17 amendments. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=406.56s)]
*  Do those amendments do anything? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=410.56s)]
*  Do those amendments, first of all, will any of them be considered? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=412.56s)]
*  And if they were to take place, would they change this bill meaningfully? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=415.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=421.76s)]
*  And I worked at Planned Parenthood for six years before I ran for office. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=422.76s)]
*  I was a Planned Parenthood patient before then. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=425.76s)]
*  These issues are personal to me, not only as a woman and someone of reproductive age, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=428.76s)]
*  but as someone who cares about the next generation of Floridians who deserve full bodily autonomy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=432.76s)]
*  The 17 amendments that we have filed range from removing the ban to adding more exceptions, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=437.76s)]
*  doing whatever we can to not only amplify how dangerous this bill is, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=442.96s)]
*  but to hopefully, of course, make it less harmful if it does actually become law. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq2uTxGTOnA&t=446.96s)]
