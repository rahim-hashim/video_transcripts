# Fake Trump Electors, Trump White House Spokesman Receive January 6th Committee Subpoenas
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA)
*  The January 6 investigation today subpoenaed two electors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=0.0s)]
*  in each of the seven states, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=3.4s)]
*  the ones who were elected as chairperson and secretary [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=4.9s)]
*  to preside over the signing of these fraudulent documents. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=8.94s)]
*  Now that list of 14 subpoenaed fake electors [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=12.64s)]
*  actually and surprisingly includes prominent figures. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=15.74s)]
*  It actually includes figures like the chairman [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=19.18s)]
*  of the state Republican party in the state of Georgia, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=22.18s)]
*  in the state of Nevada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=25.22s)]
*  And it's interesting because the chairman [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=27.22s)]
*  of the January 6 investigation, Congressman Benny Thompson, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=29.1s)]
*  I said, quote, we believe the individuals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=32.2s)]
*  we have subpoenaed today have information [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=34.86s)]
*  about how these so-called alternate electors met [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=37.5s)]
*  and who was behind that scheme. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=41.1s)]
*  Now we encourage them to cooperate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=43.74s)]
*  with the select committee's investigation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=45.28s)]
*  to get answers about January 6 for the American people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=47.34s)]
*  and help ensure nothing like that day ever happens again. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=50.42s)]
*  And even as those subpoenas go out today [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  NBC News Tonight has confirmed news first reported by CNN [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=60.06s)]
*  that the January 6 investigation has also subpoenaed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=62.86s)]
*  Trump White House press secretary, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=66.16s)]
*  deputy press secretary, excuse me, Judd Deer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=67.66s)]
*  Now all of which, when you think about it, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=70.26s)]
*  goes to show really the scope [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=72.36s)]
*  of the January 6 investigation from meetings [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=74.56s)]
*  that took place in the White House immediately [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=77.7s)]
*  around the events of January 6 [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=80.58s)]
*  to these gatherings of fake electors [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=82.58s)]
*  in seven states that happened weeks earlier. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=84.98s)]
*  Lots of questions and the timeline is just being flushed out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=89.88s)]
*  Joining us now is California Congressman [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=93.08s)]
*  and member of the January 6 investigation, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=95.12s)]
*  Peter Aguilar. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=97.62s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much sir for joining us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=98.66s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your time this evening. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=100.68s)]
*  Let me ask you about that last point that I just left on, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=102.36s)]
*  the scope of the investigation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=104.86s)]
*  Why subpoena these fake Trump electors? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=107.76s)]
*  How does what they were doing fit [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  into what your investigation, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=113.1s)]
*  into the narrative that is being woven around January 6 [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=114.8s)]
*  and you trying to get to the bottom of it? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=118.3s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Eamon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=121.68s)]
*  I think the importance of these 14 individuals [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=122.98s)]
*  is because we wanna know how deep this conversation went [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=126.04s)]
*  with individuals in and around the White House. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=130.12s)]
*  Was this something that they were directed to do [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=132.76s)]
*  by the Republican party officials [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=135.08s)]
*  or was this something that was more coordinated? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=137.76s)]
*  Those are some of the questions that we have, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=140.96s)]
*  but I think it's deeply disturbing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=143.16s)]
*  that not only did they meet at state capitals [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=145.24s)]
*  in these seven states and sent these slates of electors [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=149.06s)]
*  to Congress, but they sent them to the national archives. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=152.66s)]
*  They wanted to create this alternate universe [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=154.9s)]
*  that they purported to live in. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=160.7s)]
*  And so I think that's deeply problematic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=162.64s)]
*  We need to make sure that none of this ever happens again, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=165.04s)]
*  but we're gonna need to talk to those individuals. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=168.34s)]
*  And as the chairman's statement said, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=170.24s)]
*  we're going to ask them to come forward [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  and to speak with us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=174.68s)]
*  Can I just hone in for a moment [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=176.84s)]
*  on the backstory of these individuals? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  Because a number of the fake electors [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=181.28s)]
*  who participated in this scheme said at the time [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  that they believed they were creating these documents [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  as kind of a backup in the event [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=188.34s)]
*  that the Trump campaign prevailed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  and its election challenges in court. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=192.76s)]
*  Obviously that didn't happen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=195.18s)]
*  The documents submitted from Pennsylvania [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=197.32s)]
*  and New Mexico actually were very explicit. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=199.12s)]
*  They explicitly stated that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=201.0s)]
*  Do you think those in other states [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=202.66s)]
*  may have been misled by the Trump campaign officials [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=206.48s)]
*  into believing that's what they were in fact doing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=208.88s)]
*  with these fake electors when in fact the Trump campaign [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  intended to use those fake electors slates [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=214.36s)]
*  to try and overturn the election in Congress? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=216.82s)]
*  I think it's altogether possible, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=221.16s)]
*  but I also think it's altogether possible [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=223.0s)]
*  that they were hearing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=225.0s)]
*  a multiple different conspiracy theories. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=226.1s)]
*  And so different individuals in different states [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=229.0s)]
*  might've had different ideas of what was happening. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=231.9s)]
*  And I think that puts the importance [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=234.06s)]
*  and the finer point behind [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=235.62s)]
*  why we'd like to have continued conversations with them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=237.12s)]
*  Who were they coordinating with? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=239.76s)]
*  Who were they talking to? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=241.06s)]
*  Who was giving them advice on where to send this? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=242.85999999999999s)]
*  Who to recruit to help them? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=246.34s)]
*  Those are the important pieces [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  that we wanna get to the bottom of. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=250.2s)]
*  And we've pledged to our colleagues [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=251.64s)]
*  and to the American public [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  that we're gonna turn over every stone [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  and make sure that we seek the truth. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=256.74s)]
*  And so this is the natural next step of where we need to go. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=258.18s)]
*  Let me, if I can, Congressman, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  just drill down for a moment on the timeline [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=263.36s)]
*  in particular on January 5th. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=265.44000000000005s)]
*  Can you confirm the NBC News reporting tonight [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  that the committee has also subpoenaed [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=269.88000000000005s)]
*  Trump White House Deputy Press Secretary, Judd Deer? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  And if I can, a second part to that, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=274.68s)]
*  is it the case that you are particularly interested [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=276.54s)]
*  in an Oval Office staff meeting on January the 5th? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=280.12s)]
*  The importance, if you will, of that meeting? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=282.72s)]
*  Yes, we have issued a subpoena to that individual, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=286.62s)]
*  the former White House aide. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=290.6s)]
*  And I think it's because he was a part of three conversations [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=292.46s)]
*  and continuing threads that we'd like to have [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=297.5s)]
*  more conversations about. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=300.8s)]
*  One was, he continued to fan the flame [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=302.18s)]
*  that the election was rigged, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=305.24s)]
*  leading up to January 5th and January 6th. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=308.72s)]
*  That January 5th, we have reason to believe [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=311.38s)]
*  he was in the Oval Office during that discussion. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=314.36s)]
*  And on January 6th, we also feel that he played a role [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=316.92s)]
*  in coordinating the White House response to that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=321.92s)]
*  as the insurrection was going on. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=325.76s)]
*  So those are some of the conversations [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=328.36s)]
*  that we seek to have with that individual, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=329.84s)]
*  and he has received a letter from the chairman. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=333.64s)]
*  Has he responded to you or not yet? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=337.28s)]
*  I'm not aware of a response to date, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=340.28s)]
*  but I think this was happening in real time today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpuIz_YOnyA&t=341.84s)]
