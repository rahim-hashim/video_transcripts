# Maddow outlines J.D. Vance's radical extremism on Ukraine, abortion rights
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk)
*  Looking at live images right now of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight is night two. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=7.04s)]
*  After JD Vance was announced as Trump's running mate on night one, this was the follow-up [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=9.14s)]
*  headline at Politico.com, Trump's VP pick spells disaster for Europe and Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  But the U.S. for the moment standing as the most important ally in the world for a country [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=21.64s)]
*  that is fighting for its very existence after having been invaded by Russia, Trump has already [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=26.6s)]
*  effectively pledged that the U.S. will switch sides in this war if he is elected. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=32.44s)]
*  He has gone so far as to say that he will tell Russia that they can do, quote, whatever [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=36.96s)]
*  the hell they want to any of our NATO allies once he's president. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=41.36s)]
*  But even so, of all the choices that Trump could have made for his running mate, Senator [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  JD Vance is the single most radical choice he could have made on this issue. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=52.12s)]
*  Senator Vance has said bluntly that he is opposed to virtually any proposal for the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  U.S. to continue funding this war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=62.04s)]
*  Vance said even more bluntly, quote, I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  or the other, which understandably has Ukraine and the rest of Europe and everyone who cares [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  about the biggest European war since the Nazi era, since World War II, has everyone a little [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=74.32s)]
*  freaked out about the prospect of a vice president, JD Vance. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=79.28s)]
*  I mean, Moscow is delighted, but the rest of the world, not so much. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  On the issue of abortion, a key, if not the key electoral issue motivating voters this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=87.68s)]
*  fall, JD Vance opposes abortion in any instance, even in cases where a woman is only pregnant [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=93.72s)]
*  because she was raped or she was the victim of incest. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=101.08s)]
*  JD Vance says even those women in every instance should be forced by the government to stay [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=105.2s)]
*  pregnant for the full term and should be forced by the government to give birth against their [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=111.12s)]
*  will. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=116.36s)]
*  He supports what he calls a, quote, minimum national standard to restrict abortion everywhere [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=117.64s)]
*  in all 50 states, meaning effectively a national abortion ban. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=123.28s)]
*  There's another part of Vance's record on abortion that's also now starting to get some [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=128.44s)]
*  attention given his promotion to vice presidential running mate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=132.32s)]
*  Let's say you're a woman, an American woman who lives in Mississippi and you need to get an [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=135.8s)]
*  abortion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=139.76s)]
*  The Republican controlled government in your state, Mississippi, has, of course, banned [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=140.72s)]
*  abortion. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=144.24s)]
*  So you're going to need to travel out of state in order to get one. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=144.84s)]
*  Well, not so fast, not according to JD Vance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=150.2s)]
*  This is not exactly a hypothetical. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=153.84s)]
*  The Republican attorney general in Mississippi has said that she believes Mississippi law [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=155.8s)]
*  enforcement has the power to effectively follow you out of the state if you find yourself [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  in this circumstance. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  She believes Mississippi law enforcement has the power to get your medical records from [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=167.6s)]
*  any state in the country to see if you might have been able to get an abortion somewhere [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=172.88s)]
*  else, even in a state where it's legal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=177.16s)]
*  Mississippi law enforcement wants to be able to get your medical records from any state [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=179.76s)]
*  in the country so they can use those records in bringing criminal prosecutions for abortion. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=184.48s)]
*  And it's not just Mississippi. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=190.72s)]
*  Republican attorneys general in 19 different states all signed on to a letter to the Biden [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  administration last year saying they would like the right to go after private medical [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  records from anywhere in the country, including any state where abortion is legal. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=202.88s)]
*  They want the right to follow women from their states all over the country to see if they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  might be getting an abortion somewhere or might be getting any other kind of reproductive care [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  anywhere that they want to bring criminal charges about so they can use those records [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=217.84s)]
*  for prosecutions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  Turns out Senator J.D. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=225.84s)]
*  Vance has endorsed that idea as well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=227.04s)]
*  The investigative news outlet The Lever was first to point out today that in addition [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=229.52s)]
*  to those 19 Republican attorneys general, J.D. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=233.68s)]
*  Vance also pressured the Biden administration last year that they should withdraw the rule [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=236.8s)]
*  that protects women in this instance. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=243.04s)]
*  They should withdraw the Biden administration rule that prevents law enforcement from tracking [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=244.64s)]
*  down and prosecuting women who have crossed state lines to have an abortion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=250.32s)]
*  Here is J.D. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=256.08s)]
*  Vance's signature on the letter to the White House. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  If Donald Trump and J.D. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=263.2s)]
*  Vance are elected in November, they will have the power to withdraw the Biden administration's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=264.4s)]
*  privacy rule on this issue. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  They will have the power without Congress doing anything to make it legal for prosecutors [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=270.88s)]
*  to access the private medical records of women who have left their own state to obtain abortion [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=275.92s)]
*  care so they can use your medical records to track you down and bring charges. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po5xyBD_tLk&t=280.64s)]
