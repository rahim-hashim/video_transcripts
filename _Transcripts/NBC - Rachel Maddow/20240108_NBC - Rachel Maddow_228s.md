Video Description: Rep. Adam Schiff talks with Rachel Maddow about the Republican devotion to Donald Trump over rational politics, and his realization that the North Carolina Republican Party was a "canary in the coal mine" when it reacted to losing the governorship to a Democrat by stripping the governor of power rather than accepting democratic defeat.

# 'The Republican Party is in terribly ill health': Schiff cites frailty of U.S. political system
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA)
*  President Biden, I think, I don't know, but I think, not necessarily by his own choice, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=0.0s)]
*  but by necessity, is focusing his campaign on threats to democracy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=6.76s)]
*  You very famously have made that case to the American public yourself in your role in impeachment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  in the January 6th investigation. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=16.56s)]
*  What do you make of this as a strategic call by the president? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=18.94s)]
*  I think it's born of necessity. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=21.98s)]
*  We are at a really fragile point in the history of our country, in the history of our democracy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=23.54s)]
*  You talked in your opening discussion about the state of our two-party system. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=29.16s)]
*  In a two-party system, both parties need to have relative health. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=34.28s)]
*  They need to be healthy for the system to work. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=39.84s)]
*  I look forward to the day when the Republican Party is once again a home for people like [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=43.8s)]
*  Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=49.44s)]
*  But today, the Republican Party is in terribly ill health. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  And judged by that standard, our democracy is more vulnerable today than it was three [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=56.96s)]
*  years ago. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Three years ago, we would be now two days from January 6th. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  And two days after those events, Republican leaders were repudiating Donald Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=66.64s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was talking about his culpability, and you had Mitch McConnell around that time [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=71.92s)]
*  talking about there being remedies, i.e. prosecution for someone who engages in this kind of thing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=77.14s)]
*  Here we are three years later. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  The Republican Party is trying to completely reinvent those days and what took place. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=85.78s)]
*  They have embraced him closer than ever. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=92.3s)]
*  He is worse than ever. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=94.1s)]
*  They're describing both the president and Republican leaders like Stefanik, those who [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=97.34s)]
*  were arrested on that day as hostages, as political prisoners. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=103.18s)]
*  Well, two days after the actual event, they were not describing those who beat officers [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  and gouged them, embarrassed them, and had members of Congress running for their lives. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=112.86s)]
*  They weren't describing them as political prisoners, those who were arrested in that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=117.18s)]
*  melee. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=122.94s)]
*  But now they are. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=124.18s)]
*  In terms of its commitment to democracy, the Republican Party is way worse than it was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=126.08s)]
*  on that day. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=130.98s)]
*  And it's been a clear trajectory. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=132.86s)]
*  I often look to the canaries in the coal mine, and one of them for me was in 2016, not when [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=135.46s)]
*  Donald Trump was elected. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=140.48s)]
*  All that was a pretty compelling sign we were in trouble. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=141.56s)]
*  But in North Carolina, on the same day when a Democratic governor was elected, and Republicans [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=144.72s)]
*  in North Carolina responded not by saying next time we're going to do better, not by [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  saying we'll have better message or better policies or better candidate, but by instead [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=153.88s)]
*  stripping the Democratic governor of his responsibilities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  This is what the Republicans in the legislature did. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=161.48s)]
*  That was an ethic that said it's no longer about democracy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=165.2s)]
*  It's no longer about free and fair elections. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=169.64s)]
*  It's about if you lose, you try to change the rules of the game, or as we would see [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=171.88s)]
*  four years later, you try to overturn the result. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=177.2s)]
*  Or Democrats are inherently ineligible to hold power, and only Republicans can hold [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  power. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=187.64s)]
*  I mean, that to me was the lesson out of North Carolina, that your enemy, your political [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=188.64s)]
*  enemy is not somebody who you try to beat in an election and whoever wins gets power. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Your political enemy is not allowed to ever hold power even if they win. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=197.2s)]
*  And that's the end. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=201.88s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=202.88s)]
*  If the other side wins, it is inherently illegitimate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GxaKEphBMA&t=204.83999999999997s)]
