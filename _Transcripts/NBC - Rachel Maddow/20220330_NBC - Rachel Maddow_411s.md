# Russian Recklessness Suggests Putin Learned Wrong Lessons In Past Military Disasters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg)
*  Well, what everyone seems to agree upon, except the Russians of course, is that Ukraine has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=0.0s)]
*  managed to fight the Russian ground advance to a halt almost everywhere. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=5.0s)]
*  And in some places, Ukrainian forces are regaining territory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=10.24s)]
*  One of the reasons this Russian failure has so surprised observers and experts is that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=14.42s)]
*  many people assumed that Russia had learned from its previous botched military operations, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=18.98s)]
*  because Russia's been in this situation before, less than 30 years ago, when President Boris [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=24.96s)]
*  Yeltsin sent a column of tanks into neighboring Chechnya. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  The aim was to quickly take Chechnya's capital and put down its bid for independence, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=35.96s)]
*  it did not go as planned. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  Tonight, Yeltsin is in serious trouble at home and abroad as a result of his clumsy, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=43.92s)]
*  and so far disastrous invasion of the breakaway Republic of Chechnya. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=50.56s)]
*  NBC's Tom Aspil tonight is in the little mountainous province that will not die. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=54.28s)]
*  Hundreds of Chechen rebels today headed towards the center of Grozny to see what was left [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=58.96s)]
*  of a Russian armored column wiped out trying to capture their presidential palace. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=64.04s)]
*  The Russians made the tactical mistake of sending in their fighting vehicles without [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=69.36s)]
*  infantry support. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=73.4s)]
*  Chechen defenders picked them off from rooftops and street corners. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=74.4s)]
*  When the three-day battle was over, burned-out vehicles and bodies were scattered in Freedom [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=78.72s)]
*  Square. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=83.16s)]
*  The Chechens celebrated their victory against the mighty Russian army with a traditional [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=84.96s)]
*  warden. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=89.08s)]
*  There is no place more symbolic or more important for the Chechens than their presidential palace. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=90.08s)]
*  If the Russians do get reinforcements, they'll probably try to take it again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=95.08s)]
*  They'll need crack troops, not conscripts, who are seeing battle for the first time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=100.0s)]
*  Nikolai Sergeyev, 19 years old, was sent from more than a thousand miles away. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=104.6s)]
*  He'd never heard of Grozny before his 200-man company reached the city railway station in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=110.08s)]
*  the middle of a battle. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=114.88s)]
*  He's one of only three survivors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=116.36s)]
*  The Chechens blew us to bits, he said. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=118.28s)]
*  We talk now about how much smaller Ukraine is than Russia, but Chechnya was tiny. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=123.32s)]
*  Ukraine has over 40 million people. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=130.32s)]
*  had just over one million, and yet they managed to stop a tank column and wipe out an entire [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=133.44s)]
*  brigade of one of the world's most powerful armies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  The longtime New York Times foreign correspondent, Carlotta Gall, was in Grozny at the time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=143.14s)]
*  She says there was, quote, a stunned silence in Russia in the days that followed as the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  leadership took stock of what had happened in the army, and the army sent in reinforcements. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=153.64s)]
*  She describes what happened next, quote, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=159.4s)]
*  The Russian army unleashed a terrifying onslaught of air and artillery strikes on the city. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=161.04s)]
*  A modern European city became a ravaged moonscape. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=167.68s)]
*  I remember how buildings were shorn in half and the contents of people's lives spilled [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  out of their apartments into the open air. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=176.94s)]
*  After three months, Russian forces took the city center, and soldiers sat on plastic chairs [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=180.16s)]
*  guarding a wasteland of destroyed buildings, gouged earth, and stricken tree stumps. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=185.8s)]
*  Now after leveling the place, Russia signed a peace deal with Chechnya, but Russia didn't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=193.12s)]
*  seem to have gotten much out of the whole deal besides widespread destruction and tens [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=197.4s)]
*  of thousands of deaths. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  The peace deal even seemed to tacitly acknowledge Chechnya's independence, but then Boris Yeltsin [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  tapped Vladimir Putin to be Russia's prime minister. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=210.24s)]
*  Then Putin decided he was going to finish the job. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=214.92s)]
*  The people here are still dazed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=219.92s)]
*  The surprise attack tore through the central food market. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  The sudden brutal rain of rockets and shrapnel was totally unexpected. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=224.92s)]
*  This home video taken moments after the attack here in the heart of Chechnya, and nearby [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  witnesses say four missiles exploded overhead. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=235.04s)]
*  U.S. officials say they were scuds. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=238.32s)]
*  In minutes, the dead were everywhere. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=241.24s)]
*  The Chechens claim 120 died, 400 injured. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  Today Moscow says it is not responsible. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=247.68s)]
*  Prime Minister Putin claimed Chechen rebels, and the war looks like it's escalating. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=251.44s)]
*  Today Russia threatening to double its forces in Chechnya to 100,000 strong. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=255.84s)]
*  The assault began Christmas Day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=262.76s)]
*  The Russians using multiple launch missiles causing widespread damage. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=264.48s)]
*  Russia now reports they are using fuel air explosives which literally drop huge balls [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=268.84s)]
*  of fire. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=273.28s)]
*  Today Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin reported to President Boris Yeltsin the war [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=274.28s)]
*  plan is on track. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=278.44s)]
*  The next year Vladimir Putin became Russia's president and he kept at it in Chechnya for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=281.88s)]
*  nine more years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  By the time Russian forces left for the second time, not only was Chechnya reduced to rubble [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=289.78s)]
*  but Putin had installed his own puppet leader there who has now ruled Chechnya for over [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=295.94s)]
*  15 years with notorious cruelty. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=301.02s)]
*  He currently has Chechen forces fighting for Russia in Ukraine. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=304.7s)]
*  Now remember yesterday when Russia's chief negotiator at the peace talks in Istanbul [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=310.82s)]
*  said that Russia would take steps to de-escalate military operations around Ukraine's capital? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  Well today Putin's hand-picked despot who controls Chechnya put out this video in which [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  he says that Russia's negotiator was wrong. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=326.62s)]
*  Russia will make no concessions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  Putin will not stop and Russian forces will be going into Kiev in a few days. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=333.17999999999995s)]
*  And look, this guy may not know what he's talking about but he is a reminder that for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=339.73999999999995s)]
*  Vladimir Putin the lessons of Russia's decade and a half of grinding war in Chechnya may [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=344.06s)]
*  not be to have a better military strategy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=349.94s)]
*  The lesson Putin may have taken is that if you reduce a place to rubble you get to install [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=353.06s)]
*  your most loyous ruthless henchman to run it, someone who will be your biggest cheerleader [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=357.9s)]
*  in your next invasion. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=363.94s)]
*  Everyone's suspicion is that Putin may just be using these peace talks to buy time, to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=366.34s)]
*  regroup, and launch a new offensive. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  Despite Russian claims that they would de-escalate around Kiev and Chernihiv, this was Chernihiv [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=373.38s)]
*  this morning, a market building destroyed by Russian strikes overnight, eerily similar [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=378.94s)]
*  to that market attack in Grozny 23 years ago, though thankfully there were no reports of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=384.26s)]
*  casualties today. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF8RX6y18cg&t=389.71999999999997s)]
