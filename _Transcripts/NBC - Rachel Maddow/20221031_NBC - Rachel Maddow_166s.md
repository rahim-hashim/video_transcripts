# Right-Wing Resists Facts About Extremist Violence To Preserve Identity Of Victimhood
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw)
*  With the federal affidavit that we saw from the FBI agent related to the federal charges, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=0.0s)]
*  with the statement that we got from the San Francisco DA explaining the state charges [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=5.3s)]
*  and what were the circumstances that led to those charges, you do have detailed factual [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=12.08s)]
*  assertions that, if you read them closely, seem to be rebutting some of these rumors [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  and lies that are out there circulating. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=22.52s)]
*  I wonder what you think about that as a potential sort of funneling process or sieving process [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  for making sure that the truth stays connected to these stories. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=30.54s)]
*  I think at the end of the day it's the thing that's going to be on Wikipedia which might [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=34.8s)]
*  help down the line, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=37.96s)]
*  That's the thing that the kids are going to read years down the line, probably instead [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=38.96s)]
*  of history books. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=43.12s)]
*  However, in the moment, right now, if you talk to somebody at a supermarket, you would [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=44.12s)]
*  probably hear the lie that was pushed around by Elon Musk this weekend. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=48.36s)]
*  50% of the time, I would guess. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=54.16s)]
*  I mean, that's how pervasive this thing was over the weekend. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=55.64s)]
*  And the other thing I want to bring up with this is that this guy, you know, David DePapp [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=60.6s)]
*  was a fervent QAnon guy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=63.68s)]
*  He was a fervent Pizzagate believer that he thought he was doing something for the cause here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=65.4s)]
*  He thought he was taking out the lead member of the cabal. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=72.16s)]
*  But the second somebody actually acts on the things that these people want them to act on, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=76.52s)]
*  the second somebody does the thing that they are agitating for, which is violence against [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=82.0s)]
*  their political enemies who they believe are like eating kids in some cases, or worse, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  or, you know, at least doing immense corruption. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  The second that happens, they abandon that person. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  They throw him to the wolves. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=96.32s)]
*  They created a whole world where this man was actually secretly in love with the person [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=98.0s)]
*  he went to go attack. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  So the problem right now in this space is that they are incredibly cowardly about this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=104.84s)]
*  You have the tens of thousands of people saying this stuff, saying they're going to go do [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=114.16s)]
*  violence. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=117.92s)]
*  And somebody goes and does it, and they don't even disown that person. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=118.92s)]
*  They just say it couldn't be us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=123.0s)]
*  But it is them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=124.88s)]
*  They talk about this violence all the time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=125.88s)]
*  So they try to benefit from all sides of this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=127.44s)]
*  They need to maintain this permanent victimhood, this permanent idea that they could never [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=129.32s)]
*  be doing anything wrong. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=134.56s)]
*  But they are committing, you know, very frequently now, political attacks, physical, violent [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=136.88s)]
*  political terror attacks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCl-EGaOSMw&t=144.4s)]
