# Biden hopes to head off any regional expansion of war with trip to Israel: Rep. Himes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8)
*  Joining us now live here in studios, Congressman Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, which is always important, but [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=4.48s)]
*  days like this, it's crazy important. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=8.72s)]
*  Congressman, it's nice to see you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=10.88s)]
*  Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=12.4s)]
*  Do you think that President Biden's personal plans to visit Israel the day after tomorrow [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  are indicative that there has been some sort of major breakthrough that he wants to be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=20.2s)]
*  there to take credit for, or is him going there something that will hopefully shake [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=23.96s)]
*  loose those kinds of diplomatic advances that we haven't yet seen? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  I don't think there's anything to celebrate just yet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=32.04s)]
*  And based on the contact I've had over the course of the last week or so at the White [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=34.0s)]
*  House and State Department and elsewhere, I think what this is largely about is just [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=37.28s)]
*  indicating his personal and the United States' commitment to keeping this war from getting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=41.96s)]
*  regional, from getting bigger. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=47.44s)]
*  Two carrier strike groups in the region, the movement of a couple of air wings and the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=49.12s)]
*  president of the United States visiting not just Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=52.92s)]
*  And by the way, if you saw his statement today, visiting Israel to support Israel, as we do, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  but also saying there is a huge difference between Palestinians, especially innocent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=59.48s)]
*  Palestinians, and Hamas, but also going to Jordan, also going to Egypt, that says to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Iran, it says to Hezbollah, it says to terrorist elements in the West Bank, don't do it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=68.0s)]
*  And that's really critical. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=72.84s)]
*  Absent that kind of full court press that you're describing, political, diplomatic military [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=73.84s)]
*  from the United States, do you think that we would be at real risk of a regional conflict? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=80.28s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=84.84s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=85.6s)]
*  No, and it's not even close to a done deal yet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=86.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons, apart from the moral reasons for encouraging the Israelis [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=91.28s)]
*  to be very careful, abide by the laws of armed conflict, et cetera, et cetera, apart from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=94.84s)]
*  the important moral reasons, Hezbollah faces politics too. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=98.92s)]
*  And if the images coming out of Gaza of a military operation were as brutal as Hamas [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=102.96s)]
*  would like them to be, Hezbollah might feel like they've got no choice but to jump in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  And today, if that happened, it would be very, very bad. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=112.0s)]
*  Had that happened a week ago when Israel was caught on the back feet, it could have been [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=115.32s)]
*  a true crisis for the state of Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  What about our allies in the region, countries like Jordan, where the president's going to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  be visiting, the issue of leverage and diplomatic skill when it comes to nations like Qatar [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=125.96s)]
*  trying to intervene in the hostage issue, those thorny questions that I was just discussing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  with Eamon about Egypt and its own interests in the Sinai Peninsula, the crossing with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=136.12s)]
*  Gaza, what it's being asked to do, what it feels like it can do. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of our diplomatic effort right now? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  How much effort is being done there and what else could be done that hasn't already happened? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=147.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, apart from what we were just talking about, trying to keep it from the conflict [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=150.72s)]
*  from widening Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, these are rulers who very much worry about [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=154.6s)]
*  their own heads. And right now they're thinking, you know, our street. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=161.0s)]
*  And this is certainly true of the king of Jordan. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=165.32s)]
*  It's true in Egypt where they have massive economic problems to begin with. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=167.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is a little different case. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  They're worried about their own survival. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=172.56s)]
*  And so they, too, have an interest in this conflict not widening. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=174.36s)]
*  They also have an interest. And this is why so many of them release statements that were, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=177.44s)]
*  you know, pretty aggressively, uncomfortably, shall we say, pro-Palestinian. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  By that, I mean, no problem being pro-Palestinian, but pro-Hamas takes us to a whole other world. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=184.8s)]
*  They really worry about their own survival. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  In terms of what the U.S. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  response can be, we expect that there'll be an emergency aid request for Israel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=193.6s)]
*  Obviously, nothing goes through the United States House when there is no United States [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=197.68s)]
*  House. Do you think that the Republicans are going to elect Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan, to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=201.56s)]
*  be the speaker of the House tomorrow? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=207.2s)]
*  It's it has been for many reasons been a difficult day, but I just never imagined we'd [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=209.24s)]
*  be at a point where we were talking about a speaker, Jim Jordan. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=214.68s)]
*  And I'll come back to your question. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=217.92s)]
*  But I mean, nobody I think nobody did more to justify and to back and to paper over [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  not just Trump's misbehavior, you know, not a good idea to tell Zelensky that you're not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  sending military aid unless he gives him dirt on the Bidens, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=230.44s)]
*  You know, but but but also after January 6th, I mean, you know, he refused a congressional [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=233.56s)]
*  subpoena of a commission that was trying to figure out how big the plan was to to to stop [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=238.2s)]
*  the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=242.88s)]
*  And Jim Jordan was right in the mix of that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  Back to your question, the White House is, I think, at least when I heard a couple of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=247.36s)]
*  days ago, they are going to submit a package to the Congress that will involve both Ukraine [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=251.24s)]
*  aid and aid for Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=255.84s)]
*  That's going to make an awful lot of Republicans pretty angry. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=258.08s)]
*  But I know that my party and the Senate, both sides of the aisle care a lot about doing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  both. And so I think you're going to see that from the White House to the Senate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=266.04s)]
*  And then, you know, if we just happen to stumble upon a speaker of the House, maybe we take [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=269.12s)]
*  it up to. Wow. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=273.0s)]
*  I can't believe this is like this is the hand we have to play at this exact moment. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  Had to be now. Right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=279.68s)]
*  Congressman Jim Himes is a Democrat of Connecticut, is the ranking member, the top Democrat on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  the House Intelligence Committee. It's always good to have you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=285.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gdLs7wXVT8&t=287.88s)]
