# Kyiv Resident Talks With Maddow On Russian Invaders Closing In
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU)
*  For all the geopolitics, for all the drama and the diplomacy, at the human level, these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=0.0s)]
*  are just bluntly terrifying times for our fellow human beings who live in the Ukrainian [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=28.0s)]
*  capital city of Kyiv. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=34.16s)]
*  For the second straight night tonight, loud explosions and heavy gunfire have been heard [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=35.6s)]
*  in the capital city. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=40.24s)]
*  Just a few hours ago, Ukraine's president told Kyiv residents to prepare for what could [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  be a long and difficult night with Russian forces expected to be storming the city. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=46.0s)]
*  Ukrainian officials say Russian troops are approaching Kyiv from the north, through Belarus [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  and also from areas under Russian control in the east of Ukraine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  Ukrainian artillery and tanks have also been seen moving through the city of Kyiv. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=60.4s)]
*  Earlier today, we saw reports of thousands of Ukrainian volunteers lining up at recruitment [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=64.6s)]
*  centers to receive weapons, to try to fight on their own, to try to help their own country's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=69.72s)]
*  military withstand the assault. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=75.12s)]
*  The UN estimates that more than 50,000 people have already left Ukraine. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=78.6s)]
*  A hundred thousand more have been displaced inside Ukraine, and many others are just trapped [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=81.72s)]
*  where they are with nowhere a way to move around. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=86.08s)]
*  One of them is a man named Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=89.52s)]
*  He's a restaurant owner. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=92.36s)]
*  He lives in central Kyiv. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=93.36s)]
*  Two nights ago, the building where he lives, he says, was full. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=95.32s)]
*  Life was almost normal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=98.64s)]
*  Today, that same apartment building in Kyiv is virtually empty. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  He's now passing the hours inside with a small group of neighbors and friends that remained. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=103.84s)]
*  They are cooking together, eating together, trying to support each other and trying to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=108.68s)]
*  find a way out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=112.92s)]
*  At first, they took refuge inside one apartment in the building, but hearing explosions and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=113.92s)]
*  air raid sirens, they decided they needed to stay away from exposed doors and windows. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=119.0s)]
*  They decided they would all go underground. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  They grabbed pool chairs and pillows. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  They've made improvised beds, and they are staying now in the underground garage at their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=128.68s)]
*  apartment. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=132.68s)]
*  Alexander told us today the place feels like a bunker, but even down there, they can still [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=133.96s)]
*  hear the explosions and the sirens outside. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  Alexander and his group of neighbors, they say they hope to leave the city actually just [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  in a few hours, but they don't know if they'll be able to. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=144.66s)]
*  They've got a car packed, but as of this point, they don't have any gas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=147.2s)]
*  They have enough food for a few days, but they also really have nowhere to go. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=151.16s)]
*  Joining us now live from Kyiv is Kyiv resident and restaurant owner Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=156.56s)]
*  Mr. Prokorenko, I'm really grateful to you for joining us tonight. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  I hope you're okay. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=166.16s)]
*  Yes, good evening, which is basically good morning in Kyiv, but not really good. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=168.88s)]
*  Well, tell us how you've been living, you and your neighbors these past few days. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=175.76s)]
*  Well, we've been living. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=182.04s)]
*  We woke up like two days ago with a large alarm saying that, you know, we are under attack. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=183.48s)]
*  So we went we all went to the basement. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=191.48s)]
*  You know, we we knew what we're going to do, but still it was a it was a mass panic. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=193.92s)]
*  You know, people started to leave the city, you know, straight away. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=199.28s)]
*  And there was there is still a big traffic jams like, you know, to the west, to the eastern, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=205.24s)]
*  to the western Ukraine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=210.64s)]
*  So, you know, people that usually make their way to live or Ivana from Kyiv, which takes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=212.32s)]
*  them like six to 10 hours. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=217.88s)]
*  They spend there like 24 or 28 hours just in the traffic jam, moving slowly to other parts of Ukraine where it's more safe. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=220.76s)]
*  But basically, we know that there is no safe place now anywhere in Ukraine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  So. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=236.0s)]
*  Do you think that your best option is still to get out on the road and to try to get west, to try to get potentially across an EU [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=238.6s)]
*  border nation? Well, you never know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=247.2s)]
*  So I think it's you know, we decided to stay on one place because we're all together. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=250.56s)]
*  But still, well, from from yesterday morning till now, almost everybody left from this building. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=257.24s)]
*  So it was almost around 100 people here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  But since we heard that, you know, that the troops are the military troops of Russia and moving towards the Kyiv, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=268.68s)]
*  we started to hear to hear the explosions, started to hear gunfires and worse than you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=276.36s)]
*  So again, the third or second row of panic happened again. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=282.24s)]
*  And people just started to move out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=288.08s)]
*  I don't think there is a safe place either to stay or to go. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=291.24s)]
*  You know, we don't know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=294.92s)]
*  But people, as you said before, people are getting getting guns and, you know, to protect the city, not just Kyiv, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=296.44s)]
*  but every city in Ukraine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=305.56s)]
*  When we are asking everybody to help us, you know, we're saying to the world, please help us, you know, don't be silent. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=308.64s)]
*  This is this is this is our message. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=316.2s)]
*  You know, we don't want to fight. We don't want war. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=318.4s)]
*  We never wanted a war. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=321.0s)]
*  Good and happy countries. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=324.2s)]
*  Your president made a appeal, essentially, essentially gave a warning to residents of Kyiv tonight, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=327.96s)]
*  saying it is going to get bad. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=333.96s)]
*  The expectations are that it's bad. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=336.12s)]
*  They've also called for people to anybody you can fight to fight. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  I guess I feel like us watching from the outside, your president is very visible. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=342.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of concern that Russian troops are going to come in and try to find him and kill him and proverbially [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=347.0s)]
*  decapitate the government and replace it with some sort of Russian puppet regime. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  I have to ask if if seeing him make the kind of public pronouncements that he's made, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=356.67999999999995s)]
*  seeing him staying in Kyiv and talking the way that he is to you and other residents, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=360.28s)]
*  if that's at all heartening to you or how you feel about that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=365.52s)]
*  Well, we we feel a strong support from the president because, you know, he's he's always reporting [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=370.96s)]
*  the latest news of what we did and where is the enemy and what we're going to do. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. And yesterday we got all his message. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=383.88s)]
*  She's very active in the Instagram and saying that he's there and all of his team is there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  So and we feel, you know, like we are all united. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=392.64s)]
*  And you know, but still, we're a little country. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=397.12s)]
*  We cannot fight again. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=400.12s)]
*  Big military government is Russia. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  So this is this is. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo9kCoqYZiU&t=405.36s)]
