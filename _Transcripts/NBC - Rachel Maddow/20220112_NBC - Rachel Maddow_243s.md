# McCarthy Facing Another Possible Republican Indictment As Gaetz Case Develops
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58)
*  True to form, though, Republican Congressman Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska just this week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=0.0s)]
*  announced that he, too, is going to run for re-election, even while he is under federal [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=4.4s)]
*  indictment and awaiting trial on multiple felony counts. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=9.16s)]
*  You know, hey, it worked for Congressman Chris Collins and Congressman Duncan Hunter. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=12.76s)]
*  Republican voters re-elected them while they were awaiting trial, too. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Why not Jeff Fortenberry? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=22.28s)]
*  That said, Donald Trump is no longer president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  So, the end game here is less certain. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=29.08s)]
*  After Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins were convicted and sentenced to long federal prison [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=32.6s)]
*  terms, then President Donald Trump pardoned each of them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=36.64s)]
*  If Republican Congressman Jeff Fortenberry is also convicted, like Collins and Hunter [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  were, Jeff Fortenberry will have no such ace in the hole. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  There is no Donald Trump there now to pardon him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  So if Fortenberry is convicted, Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy gets to look forward [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=52.84s)]
*  to the, you know, the awkward dance of this serving Republican member of Congress prepping [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=58.14s)]
*  for his prison term and, you know, having to make him resign and all of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=62.54s)]
*  It's become almost a regular part of Kevin McCarthy's job by now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=67.82s)]
*  Three times in just the last five years this has happened to him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=71.98s)]
*  And now, again, it looks like it might be happening to him again, which, I mean, honestly, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=76.54s)]
*  this is like getting hit by lightning while you're winning the lottery on a blue moon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=83.42s)]
*  on your birthday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=87.66s)]
*  Like, this is just not normal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=88.66s)]
*  But this is Kevin McCarthy's life. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=90.3s)]
*  The great Florida political reporter Mark Caputo works for NBC News now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=92.66s)]
*  Quite a coup for NBC to have landed him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=96.82s)]
*  There really is nobody like Mark Caputo in Florida political journalism today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=98.38s)]
*  And today Mr. Caputo is the sole byline on this scoop from NBC News. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  Although I should mention the legendary NBC justice correspondent Pete Williams contributed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=106.5s)]
*  reporting to this as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  Orlando, Florida, quote, Congressman Matt Gaetz's ex-girlfriend testified today before [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  a federal grand jury investigating him for sex crimes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  A major development that suggests the U.S. Department of Justice may be moving closer [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=122.22s)]
*  to indicting Congressman Gaetz. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=126.78s)]
*  The ex-girlfriend, whose name is being withheld by NBC News to respect her privacy, has been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=129.5s)]
*  in talks for months with prosecutors about an immunity deal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=133.5s)]
*  Under a possible deal, she would avoid prosecution for obstruction of justice and return for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  testifying in the investigation into whether Gaetz, in 2017, had sex with a 17-year-old [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=141.3s)]
*  female for money. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=147.18s)]
*  And whether months later he and others violated a federal law prohibiting people from transporting [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=149.5s)]
*  others across state lines to engage in prostitution. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=154.18s)]
*  Gaetz has not been charged with the crime. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=158.3s)]
*  He has denied all accusations. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  The attorney for Gaetz's ex-girlfriend, Tim Janssen, declined comment about the case [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=162.02s)]
*  Wednesday today when he was spotted by an NBC News reporter entering the federal courthouse [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=165.70000000000002s)]
*  in Orlando with his client. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  A Department of Justice spokesman declined comment. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=172.34s)]
*  Gaetz did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=175.58s)]
*  But legal sources familiar with the case say Congressman Gaetz is being investigated for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=178.02s)]
*  three distinct crimes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  Sex trafficking a minor, violating the Mann Act, which prohibits taking women across state [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=186.78s)]
*  lines for prostitution, and obstructing justice. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=192.02s)]
*  I imagine that was a dyspeptic moment for Republican leader Kevin McCarthy today, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=197.34s)]
*  You can just imagine, like, oh, it would be a fly on the wall at the next Republican caucus [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=203.3s)]
*  meeting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=206.74s)]
*  Can you guys please stop with the criming? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=207.74s)]
*  Just for a little while, just for a hot minute, Trump is not here to keep you all out of prison [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=211.78s)]
*  anymore. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=216.38s)]
*  Enough with the felonies, you guys. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=217.38s)]
*  Hit pause. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=219.34s)]
*  Save me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivRyMqHHO58&t=220.34s)]
