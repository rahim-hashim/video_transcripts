# Trump exposed in hot mic moment planning further abuse of power
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek)
*  Okay, the tape is a little hard to hear, but if you listen closely, you can just make out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=0.0s)]
*  what the president is saying as he enters the Oval Office today with the president of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=4.7s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=10.64s)]
*  I said homegrown is next. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=11.64s)]
*  Homegrown is built. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=12.64s)]
*  You've got to build about five more places. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=13.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=14.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=15.64s)]
*  Laughter all around. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=16.64s)]
*  That was Donald Trump today talking to the president of the Oval Office. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=17.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=18.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=19.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=20.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=21.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=22.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=23.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=24.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=25.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=26.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=27.64s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=28.64s)]
*  Welcome to the president of El Salvador, a man who calls himself the world's coolest [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=30.28s)]
*  dictator. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  And you could hear there what sounded like Trump promising that he's about to send to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  a prison in El Salvador, the quote homegrown, meaning U.S. citizens. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=39.52s)]
*  He says homegrown are next. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=46.14s)]
*  You're going to need to build about five new places. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=48.2s)]
*  The Trump administration has flown hundreds of non-U.S. citizens to this foreign prison [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=52.82s)]
*  in El Salvador already, including 10 more that they flew there this weekend. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=57.84s)]
*  Even though the U.S. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  government has sent these people to this prison, the Trump administration says they have no [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  protection under U.S. law there, that this facility doesn't answer to U.S. courts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=68.58s)]
*  The people sent there are just gone. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=74.48s)]
*  They're sent into that prison maybe forever with no way to be heard, no way to contest [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  whatever the designation was that got the U.S. government to send them there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=80.48s)]
*  Certainly no way to get out ever. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=85.92s)]
*  Are homegrowns really next? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=90.68s)]
*  Would the American president send American citizens to indefinite, totally lawless, apparently [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=92.08s)]
*  permanent imprisonment in El Salvador as well? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=99.68s)]
*  Is he open to that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=102.36s)]
*  Apparently, yes, he is. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=103.36s)]
*  If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=107.36s)]
*  Now, we're studying the laws right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  Pam is studying. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=114.92s)]
*  If we can do that, that's good. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=115.92s)]
*  And if we can do that, that's good. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=117.72s)]
*  Pam, meaning Pam Bondi, the attorney general. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=120.44s)]
*  So he wants to send American citizens to foreign prisons where U.S. legal protections don't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=123.76s)]
*  apply at all, where people can be held for the rest of their lives without ever having [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=130.2s)]
*  a day in court or any sort of process. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=134.52s)]
*  He says Attorney General Pam Bondi is, quote, studying the laws right now to see if he really [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=138.28s)]
*  could do it because he'd love to do it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=142.72s)]
*  It was only last week on Thursday when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously nine to zero [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=144.84s)]
*  in favor of a man named Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=150.36s)]
*  He's a legal resident. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=153.12s)]
*  He's a Maryland father. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=154.12s)]
*  The Trump administration admits they sent him to that prison in El Salvador by mistake. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=155.72s)]
*  The Supreme Court effectively ordered the Trump administration to facilitate this man's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=161.36s)]
*  return to the U.S. from that El Salvadoran prison without explicitly defining what that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=167.0s)]
*  would look like. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=171.4s)]
*  The Trump administration has insisted that they can't return him, and they don't intend [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=173.12s)]
*  to. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=176.88s)]
*  They said that the man's fate is up to the president of El Salvador for some reason. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=177.88s)]
*  Today in the Oval Office, it was a reporter who finally asked El Salvador's president [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=182.32s)]
*  if he would please return this man to the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=186.72s)]
*  The El Salvadoran president called the question, quote, preposterous. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=191.16s)]
*  Of course he wouldn't. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=194.52s)]
*  So we have here a constitutional nightmare, a legal nightmare, obviously a moral nightmare. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  Cheryl Eiffel is the former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  She has been sounding the alarm about this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=209.92s)]
*  She has argued that Trump will start testing constitutional limits by trying to deport [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=212.32s)]
*  U.S. citizens from American prisons to places like El Salvador, and that Americans, in order [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=217.64s)]
*  to stop that slippery slope where it is, must take on the challenge of caring about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=224.46s)]
*  and standing up for U.S. prisoners. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=230.38s)]
*  Quote, many of us have been working on how to legally head off this nightmare, but public [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=233.22s)]
*  outcry and support will be essential. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=238.06s)]
*  Are you ready to march for the most despised members of our society? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=240.08s)]
*  Will you call your representatives about those who are imprisoned? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=244.28s)]
*  If you can't feel for them or their families, remember that this is just a stage in a plan [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=247.9s)]
*  that will land ultimately at our own doorsteps. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=252.94s)]
*  Every one of us deemed inconvenient by this administration will be under threat. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=255.74s)]
*  And every time Trump is successful, he grows more emboldened and more convinced that nothing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=260.26s)]
*  can stop him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=265.14s)]
*  Joining us now is Cheryl and Eiffel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=267.42s)]
*  She's the Vernon E. Jordan Jr. Distinguished Chair in Civil Rights at Howard Law School. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=268.94s)]
*  Ms. Eiffel, it's been too long. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=272.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=274.24s)]
*  It's an honor to have you with us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=275.46s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=278.62s)]
*  You wrote this piece over the weekend, sort of sounding the alarm. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=281.02s)]
*  He's talking about U.S. citizens. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  He's talking about U.S. citizens. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=285.62s)]
*  This is a constitutional end. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=287.82s)]
*  This is an end of constitutional protections in the United States in a really fundamental [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=292.58s)]
*  way. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=295.58s)]
*  That was before today's Oval Office meeting, where the president very cheerfully confirmed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=296.58s)]
*  that, oh, yes, he's talking about doing this to U.S. citizens, too. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=300.62s)]
*  Is the president actually moving faster than you thought he might? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=306.28s)]
*  Are you at least pleased that the American public have to see this as clearly now as [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=310.74s)]
*  you have been? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=313.46s)]
*  Yes, and I very much thank you for this conversation tonight, Rachel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=314.46s)]
*  I've been sounding the alarm because Trump has been saying it over and over. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=319.14s)]
*  In fact, he started out when his family first met with the president of El Salvador a couple [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=324.18s)]
*  of months ago, and he said then that the president of El Salvador was interested in housing U.S. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=329.4s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=335.94s)]
*  He said again the other night, as he was exiting or entering his plane—I don't remember [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=337.5s)]
*  which one it was—where he talked about this again. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=340.94s)]
*  He said, you know, for our worst of the worst, people who knock old ladies over the head, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  people who push people in front of subway trains, or if you had a bad judge and a bad [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=349.66s)]
*  prosecutor who didn't do the case right because they only care about politics. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=353.62s)]
*  He's been repeating this over and over again. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=357.42s)]
*  He tweeted that he can't wait to see people who attack Teslas face incarceration in El [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=359.82s)]
*  Salvadoran prisons. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=367.9s)]
*  And by now, we know Trump a little bit. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=369.82s)]
*  We know that when he keeps saying something over and over again, he is not joking. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=371.38s)]
*  We know that he is incapable of holding his cards close to his chest when they are having [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=375.76s)]
*  discussions about these things. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=380.38s)]
*  And we've seen two new reports. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=382.2s)]
*  One was in Politico this weekend about plans. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=383.74s)]
*  One is Stephen Miller's plan to do a mass denaturalization of naturalized U.S. citizens [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=387.34s)]
*  who are incarcerated. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=393.18s)]
*  We saw—can you believe it?—the name Eric Prince again, who apparently is involved in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  an effort to use private prisons in El Salvador and in other countries, with the U.S. perhaps [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=399.86s)]
*  entering into a treaty of session—something I really think about when I think about maybe [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=407.18s)]
*  from Russia—a treaty of session so that the U.S. would control the territory in that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=413.7s)]
*  country and therefore there could be no claim that U.S. citizens were being moved off of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=419.5s)]
*  U.S. soil. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=425.78s)]
*  It's crazy and diabolical, but it's real. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=426.78s)]
*  When Attorney General Pam Bondi does this studying, as the president said today, when [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=431.9s)]
*  she looks into the legality of this, which the president continually says he doesn't [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=436.82s)]
*  understand, doesn't really care about, wants to find out whether or not it's legal, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=441.7s)]
*  it's being looked into, what is she going to find when she looks into U.S. case law [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=445.06s)]
*  and constitutional protections to find whether or not this is something that they could legally [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=450.02s)]
*  do? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=453.58s)]
*  Well, it's a strange thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=454.58s)]
*  If she didn't find the Fifth Amendment that says every person in the United States—person, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=456.86s)]
*  not citizen—is entitled to due process of law, cannot be deprived of life, liberty or [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=462.58s)]
*  due process, which should have stopped the deportation of Mr. Abregu Garcia and others [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=468.1s)]
*  who received no due process. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure what she's likely to find with this look. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=476.1s)]
*  I think there are two things to think about here. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=479.18s)]
*  One is that, as almost everyone knows, there are nearly 2 million people incarcerated in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=481.5s)]
*  the United States. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=486.86s)]
*  Most of them are in state prisons, not in federal prison. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=488.16s)]
*  The person who assaulted the old lady is most likely not in federal prison. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  There are about 200,000 people in our federal prisons. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=495.7s)]
*  So I'm not sure the population that Trump is looking at, if it is the state prison population, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=498.94s)]
*  that creates complications for him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=503.62s)]
*  And in any case, we have a constitution that prevents cruel and unusual punishment, sending [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=505.7s)]
*  folks here who are incarcerated to what has been identified as a torture prison, as a [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=513.34s)]
*  prison that the warden of CICOT in El Salvador said is the prison no one ever leaves. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=518.22s)]
*  That is simply a violation of the constitutional rights of prisoners. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=524.18s)]
*  Prisoners who are citizens of this country are United States citizens, and they have [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=528.66s)]
*  the rights of citizens. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=533.22s)]
*  And so I don't have any faith that Pam Bondi, in her research, will feel bound by that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=535.42s)]
*  But that is the state of the law, and that's why so many of us have been looking at this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=543.06s)]
*  very closely and preparing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=546.24s)]
*  Because I think, as you alluded to earlier, Rachel, when the plane takes off, the plane [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=548.46s)]
*  takes off. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  And what happened to Mr. Abregu Garcia? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=552.98s)]
*  This administration has made clear they're not interested in lifting a finger to get [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=554.98s)]
*  people back, even people who were wrongfully—well, they were all wrongfully shipped to El Salvador, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  but certainly this individual was, by concession, wrongfully sent to El Salvador. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=563.7s)]
*  So it's very, very alarming, very, very frightening, and something we have to get [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=569.58s)]
*  out ahead of. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  Cheryl Anifel, Howard Law School professor and friend to this show for a very long time, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=577.42s)]
*  thank you for your time tonight. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=583.3399999999999s)]
*  We're going to stay very closely on this story. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=584.3399999999999s)]
*  We'd love to have you back soon as it develops. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=586.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=588.06s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=589.06s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=590.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=591.06s)]
*  Much more news ahead here tonight. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=592.06s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=593.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0PhviW_vek&t=606.42s)]
