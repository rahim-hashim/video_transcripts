Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at how Donald Trump's attack on USAID has sparked a widespread backlash, including from within his own party, as people speak out for the agency's mission and workers, as well as the economic ties in some parts of American to specific USAID programs, all of which Trump appears to have assumed no one cares about.

# Trump gravely miscalculates how much Americans care about USAID as backlash strengthens
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k)
*  But I said some of the pushback is happening in unexpected ways. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=0.0s)]
*  I will say, one of the things that happened today happened at the General Services Administration, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=5.62s)]
*  GSA. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=11.24s)]
*  One of Musk's guys held a video meeting with a whole division of employees at the GSA. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=12.64s)]
*  And Musk's guy was telling them at this video meeting, this video conference, that they [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=20.82s)]
*  really ought to consider this fork in the road offer—that's what they're calling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=24.64s)]
*  it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=28.48s)]
*  This fork in the road offer that demands their resignations and threatens them if they don't [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=29.96s)]
*  do it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=33.32s)]
*  In this video conference with Musk's guy, the employees there at GSA responded—I don't [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=34.84s)]
*  know, am I allowed to say they responded beautifully? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=41.2s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Quote, his assurances did not appear to work. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=47.28s)]
*  Employees in the division then rained down spoon emojis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=51.88s)]
*  Spoon emojis. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=56.72s)]
*  In the chat that accompanied the video meeting, which was watched by more than 600 people, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  according to photos of the chat screen provided to the Times and three people familiar with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=62.76s)]
*  the reaction. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=67.08s)]
*  Some employees then added spoon emojis to their statuses on Slack. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you want us to take your fork in the road? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=74.08s)]
*  Oh, you do? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=78.32s)]
*  You think we should take this fork in the road? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=79.32s)]
*  How about fork you? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=81.44s)]
*  Here's a million spoon emojis. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=82.68s)]
*  Do they think people are just going to roll over and go along with them while they destroyed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=87.08s)]
*  the government? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=90.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=91.24s)]
*  People weren't going to get mad and also get creative and also laugh in your face? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=92.24s)]
*  Fork in the road. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=98.12s)]
*  The one place that they really have done everything they can to just destroy a part of the government, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=102.48s)]
*  even though it's illegal for them to do so, is of course at USAID, which does foreign [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=110.08s)]
*  And there's different arguments about this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=115.88s)]
*  I think presumably they started there and they went for their most radical action there [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  because they figured that Americans wouldn't care because they figured that this was not [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=124.16s)]
*  going to be an issue that Americans thought was an important thing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=127.84s)]
*  It's something that only Beltway elites would care about and their voters, people [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=131.92s)]
*  on the heartland, they definitely wouldn't care because obviously it does nothing to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  do with them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=139.44s)]
*  How's that working out? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=140.88s)]
*  Here's News Channel 12, KWCH in Wichita, Kansas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=142.56s)]
*  The Kansas Farmers Union warns that disruptions to this program could eliminate an entire [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=147.92s)]
*  market for Kansas farmers. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=153.04s)]
*  The initiative sends excess crops like wheat and sorghum to food insecure regions worldwide. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=155.12s)]
*  It'll certainly be an economic hit to Kansas farmers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=161.84s)]
*  USAID purchases about $2 billion worth of commodities that are grown not just here in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=165.28s)]
*  Kansas but across the country every year. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=170.8s)]
*  Kansas farmers freaking out about this because where do you think American food aid comes [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=175.36s)]
*  from? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=180.0s)]
*  Does it come from Mars? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=181.0s)]
*  No, we do not occupy Mars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=182.0s)]
*  No, American food aid largely comes from a place called America where Americans live. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=183.84s)]
*  The Associated Press has been all over this this week reporting that what Trump and Rubio [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  and Musk have done already with this foreign aid gambit has already stuck literally hundreds [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  of millions of dollars worth of food and medicine that has already been delivered to ports abroad. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=199.28s)]
*  But it's sitting stuck in ports and it can't be unloaded because nobody knows what these [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=206.56s)]
*  clowns are doing and they tried to do this with a stroke of the pen and no planning. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=210.48s)]
*  That includes American grown food sold to the program by American farmers. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=215.04s)]
*  Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran among those freaking out about the perishable American [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=221.6s)]
*  grown food that is now sitting there to rot with all the American farmers and contractors [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  who supply these programs being told how great it is that Elon's feeding this part of the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=231.68s)]
*  U.S. government to the woodshipper and shouldn't we all be cheering that? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=236.72s)]
*  At one just one trade association in the D.C. area contractors have reportedly racked up [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=241.84s)]
*  $350 million in unpaid bills already just since they stopped the foreign aid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=247.36s)]
*  The estimated job losses in the United States just to contractors who supply these specific programs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=255.12s)]
*  The job loss in the United States is thought to be about 52,000 jobs. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=263.2s)]
*  These are people who are not government employees. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=268.48s)]
*  These are people who work in the private sector. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=270.96s)]
*  All right they keep saying oh private sector jobs are the only ones that count if you work [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=274.56s)]
*  for the federal government that's a low productivity job you ought to resign you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=278.08s)]
*  ought to get out or else. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=281.28s)]
*  Well here's 52,000 people who work in the private sector who Trump has just thrown out of a job. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=283.11999999999995s)]
*  52,000 Americans who have contract jobs related to this one agency and its programs [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=289.2s)]
*  which they tried to blow up again just by saying so even though it's illegal and even [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=294.32s)]
*  though they rolled it out with zero planning. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean please. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=304.32s)]
*  Even if you don't consider like even if you don't consider stuff like this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=306.32s)]
*  The capital city of Uganda right this is not like back country this is not like this is a big [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=312.32s)]
*  cosmopolitan city lots of traffic in and out of the capital city of a large country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=317.52s)]
*  Capital city of Uganda Kampala is having its first Ebola epidemic in years right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=322.24s)]
*  And there is a U.S. team there that is would be leading the response to Ebola so it doesn't spread [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=329.44s)]
*  and among other things come here that Ebola team in Uganda has just been axed with no warning as [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=337.76s)]
*  Uganda is having a brand new Ebola epidemic. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=345.04s)]
*  That seems smart. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=349.68s)]
*  That seems smart. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=352.32s)]
*  Even if you don't consider the fact that one of the teams just axed by Trump and Rubio and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Musk with no warning is the U.S. team that designs really highly specialized treatment regimes for [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=359.76s)]
*  individual patients who have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=366.24s)]
*  Why do you need to do that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=370.88s)]
*  You need to do that because you don't want multi-drug resistant tuberculosis to overrun the globe. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=372.0s)]
*  Right the people who are designing specialized treatment regimes for people with potentially [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=378.72s)]
*  the most dangerous pathogen in the world. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  Axed with no warning stop work and by the way you can't even access your email or any of your files. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that makes the people who actively have multi-drug resistant tuberculosis right now [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  somehow magically stop work on that too? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  Somehow magically stop work on that too? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=403.76s)]
*  I mean even if you don't consider just the deep deep stupidity of cutting people and programs like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  that there's also plainly a political miscalculation here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=414.88s)]
*  A miscalculation that we the people are also stupid and and we're also mean and we won't get it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=419.28s)]
*  right and we won't care. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=425.2s)]
*  That's why they went after USAID and foreign aid first. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  They were clearly wrong about that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=431.36s)]
*  I mean this was the huge basically spontaneous protest that broke out at the USAID building on [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=433.28s)]
*  Monday when Trump ordered the building shut overnight on Sunday night. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=439.35999999999996s)]
*  And look at this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=444.64s)]
*  This was today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  This was today. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=447.52s)]
*  In the shadow of the U.S. Capitol in the cold again on zero notice as Americans protested [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  simultaneously in 50 state capitals and cities all over the country yet more people look at this [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=456.64s)]
*  thousands of people turned up today in Washington on zero notice to try to save USAID to stand up [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=461.68s)]
*  for foreign aid and tons of democratic officials showed up as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=468.72s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=474.64s)]
*  Elon Musk's effort to dismantle the Agency for International Development is a gift to China. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=476.48s)]
*  It's a gift to Russia. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=484.24s)]
*  It's a gift to our adversaries around the world. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  Who the hell does Musk think he is? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=489.52s)]
*  He has absolutely no right in shutting down USAID. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  We cannot allow that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  We've got to take to the streets. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=500.0s)]
*  We've got to take to the rallies. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=501.76s)]
*  We've got to fight back and we must resist every motion, every action by Musk and Trump [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=503.52s)]
*  to shut down this government. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=511.28s)]
*  In the Congress we must equally resist what is happening. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=513.12s)]
*  We cannot let it go on. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=517.68s)]
*  We must resist. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=519.68s)]
*  We must be in the streets. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=521.04s)]
*  We must take every possible action to stop what is happening. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUknIBHhN9k&t=522.64s)]
