# Local Republicans Compromising Voting Systems In Pursuit Of Trump's Big Lie: Reuters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8)
*  Remember all of that talk from Republicans about voter fraud in the 2020 election, or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=0.0s)]
*  the hysterical warnings about election tampering? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=5.08s)]
*  Well, it appears they were right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=8.08s)]
*  This is a picture of Dallas Schroeder, the top elections official in Elbert County, Colorado. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  According to a new Reuters report, it was taken from a surveillance video where he was [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=15.64s)]
*  seen copying computer drives containing sensitive voting information. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=19.12s)]
*  That report states that Schroeder later testified that he not only made copies of that highly [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=23.8s)]
*  sensitive data, but he then gave it to two lawyers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=27.88s)]
*  But don't worry, he says he took great care in what he was doing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Quote, Schroeder said that he was careful to preserve chain of custody with the data [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=34.2s)]
*  he gave the attorneys, asserting that the copied hard drives remained in sealed containers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=38.2s)]
*  Mr. Schroeder is now under investigation for possibly breaking election laws and is being [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=43.8s)]
*  sued by the state of Colorado for not returning that data. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=48.0s)]
*  So yes, Republicans were right to be worried about election tampering. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=51.44s)]
*  But really, this guy was a Republican himself. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=56.88s)]
*  When those cameras caught him copying those computer drives, he was reportedly getting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=60.4s)]
*  instructions from a political activist who was trying to prove that Trump won the election. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=63.84s)]
*  Trump didn't win the election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=68.2s)]
*  And the reason we know all this, the reason we know about any of this, is because Mr. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=70.56s)]
*  Schroeder copped to the scheme in a pretty remarkable way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=74.12s)]
*  As Reuters reports, Schroeder admitted to copying the hard drives in a lawsuit he joined [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=78.06s)]
*  with other Republican officials against Colorado's Secretary of State. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=82.12s)]
*  He wasn't exactly hiding what he was up to. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  Apparently, this was just one of eight attempts to gain unauthorized access to voting systems [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=88.4s)]
*  in America that Reuters has uncovered since the 2020 election. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  And wait for it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=97.48s)]
*  Each one involved local Republican officials or activists taking the big lie and wrecking [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  havoc with it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=104.92000000000002s)]
*  This story is yet another reminder that while we talk about politics on a very national [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  level, Trump's conspiracies about the 2020 election have already filtered all the way [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  down to the most local of levels. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=114.88s)]
*  It's permeated every level of Republican discourse, right down to ordinary folks in districts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=117.24s)]
*  all around the country who believe this stuff. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=122.52s)]
*  Joining us now is Nathan Lane, a journalist for Reuters and one of the bylines on that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=126.6s)]
*  reporting. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=130.56s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=131.56s)]
*  We laid out the case of Mr. Schroeder, but can you highlight some of the other instances [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=132.84s)]
*  in which Republican officeholders or party activists tried to gain access to voting systems? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=137.64s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=143.12s)]
*  Yes, my colleague, Alexander Ulmer, was dug deep into the Schroeder case there in Colorado. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=145.12s)]
*  I took a close look at several cases in Michigan, a crazy case in Cross Village Township where [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=152.16s)]
*  a Republican and presumed Trump supporter basically convinced three men that he was [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=161.16s)]
*  working for the government, working for Sidney Powell, and convinced them to head to the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  local government office and start tampering with the vote tabulator there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  In another case in Michigan, Adams Township, it was actually the clerk. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=180.44s)]
*  The clerk, she's a Republican who was essentially refusing state orders to perform maintenance [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  on the machine because she believed that it could erase evidence of fraud in the 2020 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=193.56s)]
*  election. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=200.28s)]
*  And when sensitive county officials came to take possession of the machine, she had taken [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=201.28s)]
*  a key component and kept it in her office. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  And so now that is being investigated as a criminal investigation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=212.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=217.36s)]
*  And there is a recurring theme, especially in your reporting of, quote, preserving evidence, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=219.48s)]
*  even as these people break election laws on camera or admit to doing so in legal filings. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=223.6s)]
*  I know you're not a psychologist, you're a reporter, but can you speak to the rationale [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=227.92s)]
*  behind these vigilante investigations and how they're able to persuade people to do [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=232.28s)]
*  them? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=236.2s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=237.2s)]
*  I mean, it's exactly as you laid out previously. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=238.2s)]
*  The rhetoric is there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=242.88s)]
*  And it's one that some people are willing to take to go from that rhetoric to action. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  And if you talk to people, especially in rural parts of these states that we looked at, they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=250.44s)]
*  believe it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=257.04s)]
*  You know, I've been alarmed and very surprised at the level of the rhetoric that we've seen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=258.04s)]
*  in the last few weeks. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=264.88s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=265.88s)]
*  They believe it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=267.36s)]
*  You know, I've been alarmed and very surprised at the level of belief and how strongly they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=268.64s)]
*  believe that the election was rigged. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  And what is remarkable is that in many cases, they're choosing to believe conspiracy theorists [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=278.4s)]
*  and election denialists over their own county officials. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=286.04s)]
*  I talked about Adams Township. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=291.48s)]
*  There's the clerk there, the county clerk who oversees the local clerks, is a Republican [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=294.08s)]
*  and a very reputable clerk. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=301.2s)]
*  And she has been trying to guide that process. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=304.12s)]
*  But they just don't, they're more willing to believe someone like Cindy Powell than [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=307.52s)]
*  they are their local officials. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what their media diet is like. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  I suspect a lot of these people are not listening to local officials because they're busy watching [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  Fox Newsmax and OANN. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=322.24s)]
*  And quick last question. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=323.72s)]
*  This guy Schroeder in Colorado, I believe he's running for county commissioner despite [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  being investigated for election tampering. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=329.76000000000005s)]
*  Is there a trend here or is he an outlier in terms of just not caring and running for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=331.72s)]
*  more offices? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no, you see that, that, you know, that a lot of the people that are sort of caught [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=337.88000000000005s)]
*  in these instances, they're not backing down. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=344.92s)]
*  I did some reporting about it was an attempted breach, but in North Carolina, where a local [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  Republican leader essentially was threatening the local elections official that if they [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  didn't give, if she didn't give access to the voting equipment, he was going to get [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=359.56s)]
*  her fired. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=364.4s)]
*  And we reported about that about a week ago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=366.12s)]
*  And he's since organized another event with an election denier. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=369.76s)]
*  So there's really no backing down. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=375.8s)]
*  There isn't. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=381.68s)]
*  And I would call these people shameless, but that requires them to have shame in the first [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=382.68s)]
*  place. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  Nathan Lane, reporter for Reuters. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=388.2s)]
*  And thank you for your reporting. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=389.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-JK9NMbmG8&t=390.2s)]
