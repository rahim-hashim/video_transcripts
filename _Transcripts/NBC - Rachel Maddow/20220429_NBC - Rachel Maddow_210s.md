# U.S. Sends More Military Aid To Country Putin's Depravity In Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os)
*  If you know a thing or two about Russia, then you are familiar with headlines like these. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=0.0s)]
*  This is from The Guardian a few years back. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=4.4s)]
*  Quote, did he jump or was he pushed? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=6.4s)]
*  Russian journalists fear worst after another death. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=8.4s)]
*  Or this one from two years ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=10.8s)]
*  Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in coma after suspected poisoning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=12.8s)]
*  Here's a particularly blunt one. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=17.0s)]
*  A trio of wealthy Russians made an enemy of Putin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=19.0s)]
*  Now they're all dead. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=22.0s)]
*  If you know anything about Russia, then you know that speaking out against Vladimir Putin has consequences. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  For that reason, even those closest to him, the economic elite, the oligarchs, are too afraid to speak out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=28.6s)]
*  But now, with the illegal invasion of Ukraine and the epic economic sanctions imposed by the US and Europe on Russia, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=34.6s)]
*  the tide may be turning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=40.6s)]
*  From The Washington Post today, quote, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=42.6s)]
*  Cracks emerge in Russian elite as tycoons start to bemoan invasion. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=44.6s)]
*  In the two months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the silence and even acquiescence of the Russian elite has started to fray. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=48.6s)]
*  And some of the tycoons, especially those who made their fortunes before President Vladimir Putin came to power, have begun tentatively to speak. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=55.6s)]
*  In one day, they destroyed what was built over many years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=63.6s)]
*  It's a catastrophe, said one businessman who was summoned along with many of the country's other richest men to meet Putin on the day of the invasion. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=66.6s)]
*  Another oligarch simply called the invasion of Ukraine, quote, insanity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=73.6s)]
*  But let's be realistic. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=77.6s)]
*  These guys are starting to speak out off the record because they're worried about their money. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=79.6s)]
*  And while it's still a good thing that they are starting to talk, it's worth reminding everyone that Ukraine is losing much, much more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=84.6s)]
*  President Zelensky said today that at least 900 bodies have been discovered thus far in mass graves surrounding Ukraine's capital. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=92.6s)]
*  The mayor of Mariupol said that more than 600 people were injured after Russia bombed a makeshift hospital inside the Azof-style steel plant where the last defenders of the city, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=98.6s)]
*  along with hundreds of civilians, are hiding. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=108.6s)]
*  What is taking place is unconscionable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=111.6s)]
*  This was the reaction today from Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby when asked whether or not Putin is a rational actor given Russia's scorched earth invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=114.6s)]
*  It's hard to look at what he's doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=124.6s)]
*  It's difficult to look at the... [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=140.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=151.6s)]
*  It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=152.6s)]
*  Mr. Kirby went on to say, quote, I can't talk to his psychology, but I think we can all speak to his depravity. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=163.6s)]
*  To counter that depravity, the U.S. continues to ramp up aid. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=169.6s)]
*  Today, nearly 20 flights of military aid arrived in Eastern Europe from the U.S. to be immediately transferred to Ukraine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=173.6s)]
*  It comes as President Biden has asked Congress to approve a whopping $33 billion package to supply Ukraine with military, economic, and humanitarian aid for the next five months. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=179.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7yPAtP5Os&t=199.6s)]
