# With Biden's Nomination Of Ketanji Brown Jackson, A Strengthening Of Democracy: Ifill
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM)
*  Joining us now is Sherilyn Ifill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=0.0s)]
*  She is president and director counsel [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=2.0s)]
*  of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=3.5s)]
*  Ms. Ifill, it is an honor and pleasure to see you tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=9.0s)]
*  It's a historic night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=10.34s)]
*  It is, indeed, and welcome back, Rachel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=12.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=15.84s)]
*  Let me just ask you, if you think Judge Jackson will be [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=17.04s)]
*  confirmed, whether you think this will be politically [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=22.44s)]
*  a controversial nomination, and what kind of Supreme Court [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  justice you think she'll make if she, in fact, is confirmed? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=28.82s)]
*  Well, I think that everyone knows that Judge Jackson will [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  be confirmed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=38.78s)]
*  She was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=39.92s)]
*  last year by a vote of 53 to 44. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  She garnered the votes of three Republicans, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  including Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=48.32s)]
*  You just described her record, Rachel, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=50.38s)]
*  as one that is very moderate, highly accomplished, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=52.32s)]
*  and looks very much like the resume of others [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  on the Supreme Court. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=59.5s)]
*  The only difference is that she's a Black woman [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  and the first Black woman who will sit on that court. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  So I know she'll be confirmed, but that doesn't [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=67.0s)]
*  mean that it's an easy road. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=69.06s)]
*  We already see today Judge Jackson being called out [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=70.66s)]
*  of her name and out of her record, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=74.2s)]
*  being described as a radical leftist, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=76.36s)]
*  the suggestion that there's something about her [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  that means that we should beware and that we should have [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=82.44s)]
*  caution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=85.94s)]
*  And this has been the history of those trailblazing judges [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=87.02s)]
*  like Thurgood Marshall and like Constance Baker [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=90.62s)]
*  Motley, the first Black woman federal judge who Judge Jackson [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  referenced today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=96.92s)]
*  When Judge Motley was nominated to sit [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=98.28s)]
*  on the Southern District of New York [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  to become a federal district court judge, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=103.02s)]
*  there were senators who were trolling through her record [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  and insisting that when she was 19 years old, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=107.68s)]
*  she had been affiliated with communists. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=110.24s)]
*  If you read the transcript of Thurgood Marshall's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=112.72s)]
*  confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, it is shameful. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=115.3s)]
*  And this is after he had already been confirmed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=118.76s)]
*  as Solicitor General and as a judge [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=120.56s)]
*  on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=122.42s)]
*  So we've seen this playbook. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=124.46s)]
*  They can't stop the train, but their hope is to try [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=126.12s)]
*  to degrade and undermine the historic [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=129.2s)]
*  and really beautiful and important moment [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=132.42s)]
*  that we are seeing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=135.4s)]
*  And I appreciate President Biden for describing it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=136.22s)]
*  in the way he did for too long. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=139.02s)]
*  Our government hasn't looked like us, but you know, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=140.22s)]
*  I connected Rachel with your earlier segment [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=142.66s)]
*  about the Ukraine, a country that is being overtaken [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=144.66s)]
*  by this hostile power that comes to crush it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=148.46s)]
*  You know, it reminds us of how important it is [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=152.96s)]
*  to fight for your democracy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  And what we have seen over the past six or seven years [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=156.7s)]
*  is our democracy crumbling from within. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=160.3s)]
*  And how we strengthen our democracy [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=163.04s)]
*  is we live up to our ideals. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=164.7s)]
*  We demonstrate that there is equality, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  that there's justice, that there's opportunity, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=169.1s)]
*  that all members of our society can participate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=171.54s)]
*  And we recognize the need particularly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=174.94s)]
*  for the branch of government responsible [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=177.0s)]
*  for interpreting the law to do so in a way [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=179.58s)]
*  that includes multiple perspectives [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=182.58s)]
*  from people of different experiences and backgrounds [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=184.9s)]
*  to decide what the law is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=188.14s)]
*  holidays we'll see you next time on this week's, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=190.16s)]
*  we'll take a look at the campaign story and see you there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=195.06s)]
*  Next week. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=198.72s)]
*  About [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPb6-N-wtBM&t=199.76s)]
