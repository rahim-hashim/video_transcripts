**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg)
*  On page 228, she says Congressman Jim Jordan, who was very nearly speaker himself, she says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=0.0s)]
*  he may need the assistance of a criminal lawyer for sorting out the conflicting claims he [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=5.92s)]
*  made during congressional testimony about his communications with former President Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=10.66s)]
*  while the January 6th attack was underway. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=15.0s)]
*  On page 18 of her book, Jim Jordan gets this from Liz Cheney, quote, Jordan did make a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=18.68s)]
*  memorable pitch to me to join the group. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=23.86s)]
*  It went something like this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Would you consider joining the Freedom Caucus? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=28.26s)]
*  We don't have any women and we need one. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=30.66s)]
*  Cheney says, tempting as this offer was, I took a pass. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=33.42s)]
*  On page 153, here's Liz Cheney's goodbye to Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=39.06s)]
*  Quote, other members said they were upset that my impeachment vote had caused them trouble [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=44.3s)]
*  at home. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=47.78s)]
*  They thought I should have provided them cover for their votes against impeachment. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=48.78s)]
*  I had heard this complaint from an angry Elise Stefanik of New York. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=52.34s)]
*  She told me that because of my vote to impeach, people were writing letters to the editor [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=56.14s)]
*  of her local newspapers, criticizing her and asking why she hadn't taken the same principled [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=59.62s)]
*  stand that I had. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=64.72s)]
*  Cheney says, quote, that seemed less my problem than hers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  Many of us who had known Elise Stefanik since before she abandoned all principle were curious [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=72.22s)]
*  about how she had lost her sense of right and wrong. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  And he says, a number of the men who spoke in favor of removing me from leadership said [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=82.4s)]
*  they didn't like my tone. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=86.48s)]
*  I wasn't contrite enough, nor had I learned my lesson. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=88.42s)]
*  Ralph Norman of South Carolina kept repeating that his problem with me was my attitude. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=91.64s)]
*  You've just got such a defiant attitude. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  A couple of my male colleagues were so enraged by my unwillingness to apologize that they [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  got themselves really worked up and seemed on the verge of tears as they lectured me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=103.44s)]
*  I tried to follow what the most emotional members were saying, but it wasn't always [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, for example, seemed angry because I had released a statement before [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=112.36s)]
*  I voted. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=117.16s)]
*  In an effort to describe how upset he was, Mike Kelly said, it's like you're playing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=118.32s)]
*  in the biggest game of your life and you look up and see your girlfriend sitting on the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  opponent's side. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=126.28s)]
*  Cheney says, these were grown men. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  This was 2021. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=132.0s)]
*  I was standing at the podium at the front of the auditorium thinking, you've got to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=133.4s)]
*  be kidding me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Another female member started yelling, she's not your girlfriend. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=139.0s)]
*  Yeah, I said, I'm not your girlfriend. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=143.16s)]
*  She really isn't, truly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=148.12s)]
*  They're so upset about her tone and about her not taking their feelings into account. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=149.76s)]
*  But she doesn't take their feelings into account. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=155.72s)]
*  She is relentless. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqNwwXHu7Yg&t=157.92000000000002s)]
