# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Dec. 5
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI)
*  As of today, the case is now with the jury, which means we are on verdict watch in the criminal trial of the family business of former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=0.0s)]
*  We are waiting to see if the jury will find that the Trump family business guilty of a 15 year alleged tax fraud scheme. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=10.0s)]
*  We're on verdict watch for that as of today, because the jury got that as of today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=19.0s)]
*  But that is just the start of it. The legal landscape for him right now is starting to look like a scene from a black and white war movie. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=23.0s)]
*  Even as we now await that jury verdict on his company, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office is reportedly jumpstarting its criminal investigation into Trump himself, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=29.0s)]
*  renewing that office's investigation into Trump's hush money payments to a porn star while he was campaigning for president, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=39.0s)]
*  also potentially looking into whether Trump should be charged personally with the kinds of financial crimes that they charged his business with, the crimes for which we're now awaiting the jury verdict. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=47.0s)]
*  The big news on that front today was actually reported first by the New York Times. Since confirmed by the Manhattan DA's office directly, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=57.0s)]
*  they've brought in a very senior prosecutor from the U.S. Justice Department, apparently to handle these Trump cases. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=65.0s)]
*  This is a man who was the number three official at Maine Justice overall. Now he's coming to the New York DA's office. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=71.0s)]
*  Perhaps more importantly, though, in terms of understanding the import of him moving to the New York DA's office, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=78.0s)]
*  you should know that before his DOJ job, he was very intensely involved in the investigations of Trump in New York. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=83.0s)]
*  This is a prosecutor who led the investigation that caused the shutdown of Trump's fake charitable foundation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=91.0s)]
*  He also led the investigation that resulted in a quarter billion dollar lawsuit being filed against Trump and his kids and his business by the New York attorney general several months ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=97.0s)]
*  Now the Manhattan DA's office has brought that same prosecutor on as senior counsel, presumably to work on some of the things that they are pursuing Trump on right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=108.0s)]
*  But oh, wait, there's more. It slices, it dices and it juliennes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=117.0s)]
*  We are also awaiting word right now on whether the January 6th investigation in Congress will make criminal referrals to the Justice Department as it wraps up its work this month. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=122.0s)]
*  A subgroup of the January 6th investigation met on Friday to make a recommendation to the overall investigation about potential criminal referrals. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=132.0s)]
*  We don't know what happened at that meeting. We don't know what their recommendation is going to be. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=141.0s)]
*  We don't know the outcome of that process yet, but we know we'll find out their decision before the end of this month when the committee wraps up its work. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=146.0s)]
*  In the existing Justice Department, January 6th criminal investigation, Trump's White House counsel and his deputy White House counsel just were forced to testify to the federal grand jury at the end of last week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=153.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other DOJ investigation of Trump, the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, that one just pulled onto a straightaway and put the accelerator down. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=164.0s)]
*  You may remember after federal agents seized documents from Mar-a-Lago from Trump's weird gold beach house where other people can pay to visit, Trump's lawyers persuaded a fresh out of the box Trump appointed judge to install a special master to go through the documents that the government seized instead of prosecutors just being allowed to see them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=175.0s)]
*  It was basically a gambit to slow down the criminal investigation, but now a federal appeals court has put the kibosh on that special master process, which should speed up the ultimate resolution of the Mar-a-Lago case. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=197.0s)]
*  Whether that ultimately means criminal charges will be filed or not, we are going to get to that end sooner than we were previously going to get there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=208.0s)]
*  Then there's Georgia, Trump's White House chief of staff has now been ordered to testify in the criminal investigation in Fulton County, Georgia into whether Trump interfered criminally with the 2020 election in that state. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=217.0s)]
*  And Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had to appear at disbarment proceedings today in Washington over the frivolous lawsuits he filed trying to overturn the 2020 election on Trump's behalf. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=229.0s)]
*  All of that is happening right this second, right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=243.0s)]
*  And so, I mean, maybe it's a sort of natural occurrence. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=246.0s)]
*  If that was the legal outlook that you had right now, you too might yourself demand the termination of the Constitution. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=251.0s)]
*  If you were facing all of those different forms of legal liability under the Constitution. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=259.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Rebecca Royfee. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=265.0s)]
*  She's a former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan DA's office where the new senior counsel Matthew Colangelo will be working. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=267.0s)]
*  She's now a professor at New York Law School. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=272.0s)]
*  Ms. Royfee, thank you for being here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=274.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=276.0s)]
*  DA's office or AG's office? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=277.0s)]
*  DA's office. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=279.0s)]
*  So the AG's office and the DA's office, aside from the fact that we call them by their initials. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=280.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=284.0s)]
*  It's frustrating. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=285.0s)]
*  Tell me about what it means to have somebody who had that kind of experience in the New York attorney general's office coming into the DA's office. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=286.0s)]
*  I think particularly those of us people watching from outside New York don't necessarily know the difference between these offices and what their different remits might be. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=295.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=302.0s)]
*  So the DA's office is primarily a prosecutorial office. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=303.0s)]
*  It does criminal cases and the attorney general in New York primarily has responsibility for civil cases. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=306.0s)]
*  It has some jurisdiction over criminal cases, but less so. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=312.0s)]
*  So the fact that he's coming over here probably does mean that he's not because of his experience prosecuting cases. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=315.0s)]
*  It's because of his experience supervising important major investigations and particularly this investigation into the former president. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=321.0s)]
*  And I think we generally think of civil cases. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=328.0s)]
*  Again, those of us who aren't lawyers, we tend to think of civil cases as citizen A suing citizen B. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=331.0s)]
*  In the case of these civil cases brought by the New York attorney general's office, I think the one that might be more clarifying for us is one that was covered very closely in the press, including here on this show, which was Trump operating what was alleged to be essentially a fake charity using the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=336.0s)]
*  Which was Trump operating what was alleged to be essentially a fake charity using this Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable instrument to instead put money in his own pockets and do political favors for himself. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=346.0s)]
*  The result of that civil lawsuit was the shutdown of the Trump Foundation, which tells you something about what kind of teeth there can be in these findings in these civil cases. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=357.0s)]
*  Matthew Colangelo was lead on that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=366.0s)]
*  Right, 100 percent. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=368.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like a civil case where the victim is the public, where instead of being like, you know, somebody suing somebody else because that person was hurt, suffered some kind of damages. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=369.0s)]
*  Instead, it's like the public suffered damages. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=378.0s)]
*  So there's a civil case that's brought on the public's behalf. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=381.0s)]
*  That's what the attorney general is doing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=383.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=385.0s)]
*  So in this case, what Mr. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=386.0s)]
*  Colangelo, as you said, them bringing him on as a senior counsel, putting out, they gave an exclusive to the New York Times. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=388.0s)]
*  They put a press release out thereafter. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=393.0s)]
*  They obviously want people to know this is happening. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=395.0s)]
*  They're not naming him as a person working on Trump things, but because he doesn't have experience in the past as a criminal prosecutor, it is his expertise related to Trump that he that he sort of brings with him as his baggage into this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=397.0s)]
*  The reason, presumably, they brought him on board. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=411.0s)]
*  Should we surmise from that that some of the facts and some of the understanding that he garnered during these civil investigations will now result in criminal charges being brought against Trump on related matters? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=414.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's an exaggeration to say from this, we can read that there will necessarily be some kind of indictment involving the same facts as were involved in those civil cases. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=428.0s)]
*  But I think we can draw the conclusion that these cases and investigations are extensive, potentially extensive and ongoing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=438.0s)]
*  And that itself is significant because there was some question back when, you know, several prosecutors left the office about whether in fact that was true. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=446.0s)]
*  I think now we can pretty much say to ourselves, OK, these investigations are going on and they probably don't have to do with, you know, some small issue that can be resolved by the office itself, but rather are extensive and complex. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=453.0s)]
*  It was just southeast of San Jose, California, started at 1258 a.m. in an unincorporated sort of semi rural area, not far from Silicon Valley near the 101 freeway. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=466.0s)]
*  1258 a.m. Somehow, someone, almost certainly more than one person, opened up the heavy metal cover of an underground vault on the side of the road. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=479.0s)]
*  It wasn't a normal manhole cover like you see in the street everywhere, the kind of thing you might be able to lift up yourself. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=493.0s)]
*  It was much bigger than that, heavier than that, which is why investigators think it would have likely taken more than one person to open this thing up. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=499.0s)]
*  But whoever it was, they opened it up. They got inside that underground vault. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=507.0s)]
*  And when they were in there, they cut the fiber optic cables that ran through it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=511.0s)]
*  Then nine minutes later, they did it again, a different nearby underground vault containing fiber optic cables. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=518.0s)]
*  They pulled open the doors, got in there and sliced off the fiber. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=526.0s)]
*  And the consequences of that were immediate. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=531.0s)]
*  People all over the area instantly lost cell phone service and landline phone service and 911 call service went down. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=534.0s)]
*  Police would ultimately have to tell people in the area that if they were having an emergency and they needed to call 911, they should try to do that from a cell phone. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=542.0s)]
*  If that didn't work, they should try to do it from a landline. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=550.0s)]
*  If that didn't work, police advised people in the area, you're going to have to drive to the nearest fire station and ask for help in person because we have no other way for you to reach us. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=553.0s)]
*  Twenty one minutes after they cut the second set of fiber optic cables, whoever it was, started shooting into that electrical power substation with AK-47 style rifles. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=564.0s)]
*  Gators say the shooters fired more than 100 bullets into the electrical substation over a period of about 19 minutes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=578.0s)]
*  They were firing carefully enough and with enough well-informed deliberation that in that 19 minute period where they were shooting all those dozens of rounds, they were able to knock out 17 different electrical transformers in that substation, some of them by shooting them directly and some of them by causing them to melt down. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=587.0s)]
*  Quote, the shooters appear to have aimed at the transformers oil-filled cooling systems riddled with bullet holes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=606.0s)]
*  The transformers leaked 52,000 gallons of oil, then overheated. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=613.0s)]
*  The first bank of them started crashing at 1 45 a.m. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=618.0s)]
*  So between hitting the oil that was used as a cooling fluid for the transformers and hitting the transformers themselves with more than 100 rounds of AK-47 rifle fire, 17 transformers were knocked out in that electrical power substation. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=623.0s)]
*  And with the cutting of the fiber optic cables nearby, cell phone landline and 911 service was knocked out. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=641.0s)]
*  That Northern California attack in 2013, altogether, all those different components of it, it took less than an hour. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=650.0s)]
*  And by the time the police turned up, the perpetrators were gone. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=656.0s)]
*  It took 27 days for authorities to make the repairs and get that substation up and running and get that fiber connected again. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=660.0s)]
*  So again, that took place April 2013 in Northern California. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=668.0s)]
*  That attack remains unsolved. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=672.0s)]
*  Nobody ever publicly claimed responsibility. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=674.0s)]
*  Nobody, as far as we know, was ever arrested. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=676.0s)]
*  No motive was ever ascribed to whoever carried out that attack. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=678.0s)]
*  Now fast forward to this year, February of this year, February 2022. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=682.0s)]
*  Three men, one from Ohio, one from Wisconsin, one from Indiana and Texas, pled guilty to a plot to do much the same thing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=687.0s)]
*  Inspired by white supremacist ideology. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=696.0s)]
*  Department of Justice press release. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=700.0s)]
*  Three men plead guilty to conspiring to provide material support to a plot to attack power grids in the United States. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=702.0s)]
*  Domestic terrorism plot was in furtherance of white supremacist ideology. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=708.0s)]
*  And the plea agreement in that case, again from earlier this year, spells it out. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=714.0s)]
*  It says in the fall of 2019, two young men, one age 20, one age 24, met in an online forum. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=719.0s)]
*  One suggested to the other that they hatch a plan to take out electrical power substations in various parts of the country. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=725.0s)]
*  To try to set off civil unrest and to hopefully try to set off a race war in the United States. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=733.0s)]
*  This is from the plea agreement. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=739.0s)]
*  Quote, the plan was to attack the substations with powerful rifles that would penetrate the electrical transformers. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=741.0s)]
*  Members of the group estimated that would cost the government millions of dollars to recover. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=747.0s)]
*  In addition, the defendants believed that time associated with replacing the substations would cause confusion and unrest for Americans in the region. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=752.0s)]
*  There were also conversations about how the possibility of the power being up for many months could cause a race war. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=760.0s)]
*  Additionally, without power across the country, they hoped it could cause the next Great Depression. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=767.0s)]
*  People wouldn't show up to work. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=773.0s)]
*  The economy would crash and there would be a ripe opportunity for potential white leaders to rise up. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=774.0s)]
*  That plea agreement unsealed by the government earlier this year explains how these young men decided they would need to cause a big explosion as a distraction. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=780.0s)]
*  They wanted to set some set off some kind of big explosion that would tie up the police and distract police from what they were going to do to the power substations, which is something again that they hoped would cause millions of dollars of damage, something that would take months to be able to repair. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=790.0s)]
*  To set off just the distraction explosion, they admitted to buying bomb components and starting to test explosives to suit that part of their plan. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=805.0s)]
*  They also obtained multiple so-called ghost guns, guns with no serial numbers so they couldn't be traced. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=814.0s)]
*  They built what the government describes as multiple AR-47 style semi-automatic rifles. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=821.0s)]
*  They built the rifles. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=827.0s)]
*  They were building more and they started training with them at firing ranges. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=828.0s)]
*  When the FBI searched their homes, they found multiple firearms, including firearms with no serial number, multiple silencers, milling tools, weapons modification manuals, explosives production diagrams and manuals, chemicals and components that an FBI lab determined could be used to create an explosive device. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=832.0s)]
*  Prosecutors said they found, quote, a large amount of Nazi related materials such as videos, books and images, also detailed U.S. power infrastructure information, a list of specific power substations, and quote, an article regarding the sabotage of a power substation in California. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=850.0s)]
*  So the California attack on that power substation was in 2013, still unsolved. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=870.0s)]
*  This year we get neo-Nazis trying to set off a race war, planning what appears to have been a copycat attack, copying what happened in California. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=877.0s)]
*  Also, to the extent that they're also planning on using high powered rifles to shoot up electrical substations and try to knock out the power. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=887.0s)]
*  The guilty pleas to the plot that was uncovered by federal prosecutors, those guilty pleas were earlier this year in federal court in Ohio. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=895.0s)]
*  And now this weekend, here we are again, Moore County, North Carolina. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=905.0s)]
*  Shortly after 7 p.m., power outages began here in the cartridge area. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=910.0s)]
*  Shortly thereafter, the outages would spread to the greater majority of central and southern Moore County. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=918.0s)]
*  Upon the arrival of the power crews and our deputies, extensive damage was found at their substations. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=927.0s)]
*  Evidence at the scene indicated that the show that the firearm had been used to disable the equipment. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=939.0s)]
*  Power out for what they call 45,000 customers. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=948.0s)]
*  Customers in this case means 45,000 homes and businesses. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=952.0s)]
*  Altogether, we're talking about over 100,000 people. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=956.0s)]
*  Well, it was initially 45,000 customers, 45,000 homes and businesses. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=960.0s)]
*  It's now down to 33,000 homes and businesses. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=964.0s)]
*  But that's still tens of thousands of Americans tonight with zero power, zero. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=967.0s)]
*  And this isn't like lines down in a storm that you go out and rewire the lines and put them back up. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=973.0s)]
*  This is two electrical substations shot up with firearms like in California in 2013 [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=980.0s)]
*  and like the neo-Nazis just pled guilty to planning in Ohio earlier this year. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=987.0s)]
*  And we have nobody in custody, nobody claiming responsibility, no word on any potential motive, apparently no suspects. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=991.0s)]
*  In Moore County, North Carolina this weekend, it was two different electrical substations, reportedly about 10 miles apart. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=998.0s)]
*  The two of them reportedly shot at and disabled by gunfire within about 45 minutes of each other on Saturday night. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1004.0s)]
*  As for the motive, we literally have no idea. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1011.0s)]
*  And there has been a lot of speculation, both nationally and locally, since we learned that this happened. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1014.0s)]
*  Since we learned that this was a deliberately inflicted attack. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1019.0s)]
*  But honestly, bottom line, we really do not know. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1024.0s)]
*  At the first press conference yesterday where the sheriff and local officials took the first questions about what had happened, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1027.0s)]
*  they were immediately asked and then asked repeatedly whether this attack on the electrical infrastructure in North Carolina [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1034.0s)]
*  might be related to threats and intimidation that have been directed at local LGBTQ groups in Moore County recently. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1042.0s)]
*  And in particular, at a drag show at a downtown venue in the town of Southern Pines, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1049.0s)]
*  a show that started just minutes before the power stations were shot up and the lights went out. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1054.0s)]
*  There were far-right anti-gay, anti-trans protesters trying to shut down that Moore County event on Saturday, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1059.0s)]
*  just hours before the power stations were shot up. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1067.0s)]
*  This followed another similar protest by masked far-right paramilitary groups, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1070.0s)]
*  including the Proud Boys, at an LGBTQ event last month in nearby Sanford, North Carolina, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1075.0s)]
*  which is only about a half an hour away from Moore County. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1080.0s)]
*  Vice News points out today that this was a whole weekend of menacing anti-gay, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1083.0s)]
*  anti-trans protests in multiple places around the country, including Columbus, Ohio, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1089.0s)]
*  where honestly it looked like a gun show on the street outside one gay and trans-friendly event [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1094.0s)]
*  with armed Proud Boys flashing white power signs and screaming at people, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1100.0s)]
*  and a white supremacist group called Patriot Front showing up in formation, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1104.0s)]
*  White Lives Matter guys doing Hitler salutes, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1108.0s)]
*  random guys with no apparent affiliation just turning up in full camouflage military-style outfits with assault rifles. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1111.0s)]
*  That was Columbus, Ohio this weekend. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1118.0s)]
*  Lakeland, Florida had neo-Nazis this weekend outside a queer event, flying a big swastika flag. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1120.0s)]
*  Neo-Nazi Holocaust deniers showed up to another queer event in New York City this weekend as well. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1126.0s)]
*  So when Moore County, North Carolina was host this Saturday to another one of these far-right anti-gay, anti-trans protests, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1132.0s)]
*  and then just as a local drag show that they were protesting started up, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1142.0s)]
*  someone shot up the power stations and cut power to the whole county. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1147.0s)]
*  Yes, understandably, people locally immediately started asking the sheriff if that was the reason why, if there was a connection. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1151.0s)]
*  Now the sheriff has said repeatedly that he has no idea if the attack on the power stations is linked to those anti-gay, anti-trans protests. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1158.0s)]
*  There really is no indication either way. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1168.0s)]
*  The sheriff says he has no idea about a motive of any kind, no suspects, nobody claiming responsibility, no one in custody. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1171.0s)]
*  . [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sb2JMPpFI&t=1201.0s)]
