# Putin Crosses Line With Overt Nuclear Threat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc)
*  Putin parading his nuclear arsenal this past weekend, showing off to the world what Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=0.0s)]
*  is capable of before he launched his full-scale invasion into Ukraine, is unnerving in its own [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=4.08s)]
*  terms as it's meant to be. But those exercises took on new meaning when Putin just went ahead [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=11.28s)]
*  and said it, when he offered a thinly veiled threat that if any nation dared to try to stop [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=17.12s)]
*  him from invading Ukraine, they would be met with the threat of nuclear war. He said any nation that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=22.96s)]
*  attempts to interfere with his invasion would be met with consequences they have never seen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=29.68s)]
*  He described himself, he described Russia as a nuclear armed nation and said that Russia has [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=34.24s)]
*  advanced weaponry that no other nation has. As the situation in Ukraine continues to devolve, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=40.4s)]
*  there are a few nuclear components of this crisis to be aware of. The first, of course, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  is that threat from Vladimir Putin, seeing this kind of behavior and this kind of aggressive [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=53.12s)]
*  behavior and this kind of nuclear specific rhetoric from the man who is, after all, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=60.4s)]
*  in control of the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the entire world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=66.48s)]
*  As a world, we kind of freak out about the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon or [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=70.08s)]
*  North Korea having a nuclear weapon because, boy, those guys are crazy and what would they do with [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=73.92s)]
*  it if they had a nuclear weapon to use? Well, here's a guy who has 6,000 nuclear weapons, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=78.24s)]
*  who started multiple wars in recent years, including the largest land war in Europe since [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=84.64s)]
*  World War II, completely unprovoked. Talking about how he's invented some mythical history in which [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  he believes he deserves nearby nations, that they don't really count as countries, that really they're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  and, by the way, his nuclear weapons can back up all his threats. Now, we worry about Iran, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=103.68s)]
*  we worry about North Korea. Well, here it is in the form of Vladimir Putin. He's talking about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=109.44s)]
*  actively using nuclear weapons. Also, he's moving that weaponry closer to NATO borders. Belarus is [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  now moving to clear the way for Russia to move its nuclear weapons onto Belarusian soil. That'd be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=124.56s)]
*  the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union that they want to use, move Russian nuclear [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=130.64s)]
*  weapons into Belarus right up against NATO. But if there's one other nuclear-related thing to pay [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=135.04s)]
*  attention to here, it's not about nuclear weapons directly, it's about nuclear waste. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=141.92s)]
*  One of the most radioactive places on earth is in Ukraine, in Chernobyl, which is north of Kiev, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  quite close to the border with Belarus. In 1986, part of the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=153.04s)]
*  exploded. It was the worst nuclear disaster in the history of the planet. Because of all that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=160.56s)]
*  radioactivity, the 19 miles surrounding the Chernobyl site are now considered to be indefinitely [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=165.2s)]
*  uninhabitable. That whole area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is called an exclusion zone. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=172.0s)]
*  It's miles and miles of nothing and a vast amount of very dangerous nuclear waste. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=177.92s)]
*  Today, the Ukrainian government announced that Russian forces had seized the Chernobyl exclusion [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=186.48s)]
*  zone by force. That area, as well as the old power plant, all that stored nuclear waste is now fully [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  under Russian control and nobody quite knows what that means. One advisor to the Ukrainian president [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  saying today, quote, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl power plant is safe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=202.24s)]
*  Nuclear weapons pose one kind of risk, especially in the hands of that kind of a leader. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=209.2s)]
*  Nuclear waste poses a different kind of risk, but now Russia has direct control over [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=214.56s)]
*  both in and around Ukraine. Why does Russia want to be at the Chernobyl site in the first place? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=220.8s)]
*  How dangerous is their presence there? And what do we make about Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=225.76s)]
*  essentially threatening that nuclear warfare, that nuclear weapons might be part of how he considers [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=231.68s)]
*  his usable arsenal in this confrontation, not only with Ukraine, but now increasingly with the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=238.88s)]
*  entire unified Western world? Joining us now is John Wolfstahl. He served as special assistant [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  to President Obama. He was senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Security Council. Mr. Wolfstahl, I really appreciate you making time to be here. Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=253.52s)]
*  Sure, Rachel. Thank you for having me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  I realize that was a sort of provocative comparison that I raised in talking about [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  Iran, talking about North Korea and global fears about nations like that getting access [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  to nuclear weapons. Comparing a nuclear armed nation like Russia to those rogue states, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=270.4s)]
*  I realize is a provocative claim to make. That said, Russia is in effect acting as a rogue state [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=276.88s)]
*  now while referencing its access to nuclear weapons in a way that makes it seem like he's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=284.16s)]
*  threatening to use them. That's how it seems to me as a lay observer of these matters. As somebody [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=289.36s)]
*  who has real expertise in this field, let me just ask you to tell me that I'm wrong. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, I would love to tell you you're wrong and that Russia is behaving better than we had hoped, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  but that's not true. Russia has basically violated every norm and law that we have tried over the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  last 70 years to build around nuclear weapons. It has violated solemn commitments to respect [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=311.44s)]
*  Ukraine's territory, which it made in 1994 to convince Ukraine to give back 1400 nuclear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=317.12s)]
*  weapons that were left on its territory when the Soviet Union fell apart. All of the agreements [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=323.76s)]
*  since then, including one that they made just several weeks ago with the United States and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=330.0s)]
*  other nuclear states promising that a nuclear war cannot be won and therefore must never be fought. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=333.76s)]
*  And then here we are a month later with President Putin saying, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=338.88s)]
*  I'm prepared to use these nuclear weapons, so don't get involved in my backyard. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=342.24s)]
*  In terms of what he may be thinking about in terms of his nuclear weapons, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=347.68s)]
*  what do you make of this? What appears to be an effort to clear the way to move Russian nuclear [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=353.12s)]
*  weapons to Belarus? Obviously, it's one of the great high wire acts of modern history that when [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=360.0s)]
*  the Soviet Union collapsed, all of their weaponry that was in the various Soviet socialist republics [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=365.6s)]
*  ended up getting consolidated through the kinds of agreements and promises that you made, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=371.36s)]
*  including to Ukraine, that they would be protected if they agreed to give up the weapons that were [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=375.36s)]
*  on their soil. What does it mean? Why would the Belarusian leader and Putin want to move [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus? Do you think they will? And what kind of new threat might that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=385.36s)]
*  be? Well, I do think that President Putin is serious about moving nuclear weapons into Belarus. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  I think there are a couple of things behind it. First and foremost is he wants to put NATO [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=395.12s)]
*  states under threat. It's an old Soviet play out of their old playbook, which is you want to divide [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=400.0s)]
*  and create tension inside the NATO alliance. The NATO countries that are next to Russia very much [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=406.16s)]
*  want to be in a nuclear alliance because they think that deters Russia. The states much farther [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=410.88s)]
*  west are less committed to having nuclear weapons as part of the forward deployed NATO forces [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=416.0s)]
*  because they worry that it could be seen as provocative. It is useful to keep in mind the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=422.72s)]
*  United States does forward deploy nuclear weapons in Germany, in Turkey, in a number of countries [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=426.56s)]
*  that are close to Russia. And I think Putin wants to basically use that judo move against us and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=432.0s)]
*  start moving nuclear weapons closer to NATO territory to create this tension within the alliance. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=437.36s)]
*  I'm sure that always ends well, right? That's certainly always ends in peace and stability [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=443.36s)]
*  for everybody involved. Well, I mean, it's, yeah, please. Well, that's the other element involved [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=448.88s)]
*  here is that, you know, we're, we're, um, the United States and many of our allies believe that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=454.8s)]
*  nuclear weapons can be stabilizing. What we're seeing here is a fully armed nuclear country [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=458.88s)]
*  using nuclear weapons as a shield. And behind that shield, it then wants to undertake all manner of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=463.2s)]
*  gray zone and conventional conflict to achieve its strategic objectives. Nuclear weapons basically [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=468.88s)]
*  form the stalemate at the strategic level and leave countries able to use conventional weapons [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=475.04s)]
*  and other means below the surface. That's not a recipe for stability. That's a recipe for [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=480.56s)]
*  escalation. And as Ambassador Daulder talked about before, we think we're really smart about these [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=485.04s)]
*  things, but they can get out of control quickly. And any brandishing of nuclear weapons by either [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  side is something that should be avoided. John Wolfstahl, former special assistant to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=493.92s)]
*  President Obama, former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the National [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=499.6s)]
*  Security Council. Mr. Wolfstahl, thank you. This is difficult stuff. Thanks for being so clear and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=502.96s)]
*  helping us understand. Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bJlEAwoWGc&t=507.44s)]
