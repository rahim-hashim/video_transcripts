# Maddow: ‘Trump doesn’t believe election results should be binding' — as GOP apparently plans THIS
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA)
*  With just 48 days to go until election day, you may be asking yourself, where in the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=0.0s)]
*  is Donald J. Trump? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=5.4s)]
*  Is he campaigning in battleground states like Pennsylvania or Michigan or maybe Arizona? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=6.4s)]
*  Nope. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Right now, he's holding a rally in, drum roll please, Long Island, New York. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Yep, a state he's almost certainly not going to win. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=16.6s)]
*  But that is where he is spending valuable time and resources. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=19.92s)]
*  You know, at this point, I don't know, if you didn't know any better, you'd think Trump [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=23.2s)]
*  isn't even really trying to win the election. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, campaigning in New York while resources for his field operation in actual swing states [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  are dwindling, attacking black immigrants and standing by while his running mate belittles [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  women who don't have biological children, which Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=37.4s)]
*  did just last night at a town hall with Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  So my kids keep me humble. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=45.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, Kamala Harris doesn't have anything keeping her humble. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=49.68s)]
*  Yeah, ma'am, you don't sound humble. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  They're not growing the base, they're shrinking it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=61.08s)]
*  And they don't seem to care. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=63.56s)]
*  What they do seem to care about is what happens after Election Day, meaning if Kamala Harris [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=65.16s)]
*  wins, how do they once again contest the results and create a big lie 2.0? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=70.16s)]
*  Just take a look at Georgia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=75.52s)]
*  The Guardian has new reporting today on a behind-the-scenes network of county election [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=76.84s)]
*  officials coordinating on policy and messaging to both call the results of November's election [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=81.6s)]
*  into question before a single vote is cast and push rules and procedures favored by [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=87.4s)]
*  the election denial movement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  Of the many nightmare election scenarios that keep me up at night, one of the most daunting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=95.22s)]
*  is what happens if Vice President Harris wins but some states just refuse to certify? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  That could mean the election winds up in the hands of the Republican majority House of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=106.2s)]
*  Representatives or even with the Leonard Leo Six on the Supreme Court, which means Trump [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  could lose the election and still wind up as president. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=115.64s)]
*  Joining me now is maybe the only other person who is up at night while I'm up thinking about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=119.88s)]
*  these nightmare scenarios, Rachel Meadow, who I tried not to text in that moment. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=122.96s)]
*  She's also the executive producer of the new MSNBC documentary from Russia with Lead, which [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=128.28s)]
*  we're going to talk about shortly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  But Rachel, hello, my friend. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=134.72s)]
*  I hold in my hand a letter that I'm sure you have read too. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  And this is, it's Mr. John Fervey, your chairman of the Georgia State Election Board. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=140.32s)]
*  To him. And it is it is scary because it is questioning whether or not new rules are going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=145.44s)]
*  to be put in place in Georgia that make it harder to certify the election. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=151.44s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=154.84s)]
*  So a couple of weeks ago, there was this weird moment at a rally in Georgia where Trump from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=156.28s)]
*  the stage shouted out by name members, new members of the Georgia State Election Board. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=161.04s)]
*  And the Georgia State Election Board is not supposed to be like a partisan entity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  It's not like a Trump campaign thing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=172.32s)]
*  It's the technocratic board that oversees the administration of elections in Georgia. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=173.96s)]
*  And so him shouting them out by name and claiming them as like MAGA superheroes who were pitbulls [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  for victory was a bad sign. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=184.88s)]
*  But it turns out that, in fact, three pro-Trump members have been assigned to this board. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=187.68s)]
*  They are the majority of the board. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=192.68s)]
*  And since they have taken over this board, they have been passing all of these new rules [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=194.16s)]
*  in Georgia that are designed, among other things, to let local Republican elections officials [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=199.64s)]
*  refuse to certify the vote, refuse to say what the vote total is in individual counties. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=205.64s)]
*  Republicans have been trying to refuse certification since 2020 in all of the swing states, in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=211.64s)]
*  a bunch of states that aren't swing states, in more than two dozen, more than three dozen [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  instances. They've just refused to say here was the vote total in our most recent election. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=222.4s)]
*  They're doing this leading up to the 2024 presidential election when it seems very clear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=229.28s)]
*  that no matter what the results are, they're going to say there's no knowable result. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  And so this letter today is from the secretary of state's office, from Brad Ravensberg's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=238.6s)]
*  office in Georgia, telling the Georgia election board, you need to stop passing these new [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=243.48s)]
*  rules. We're way too close to the election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=247.92s)]
*  Joy, on Friday of this week, they're planning, according to this letter, to pass 11 new rules [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=250.12s)]
*  for the administration of the election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=256.2s)]
*  This is Ravensberg's office warning that it's way too close to the election for any [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=258.42s)]
*  of these new rules to go into effect and telling them not to do it. He actually calls what [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  they're trying to do absurd. But there's no reason to think they're going to follow [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=267.38s)]
*  this advice. They are really intent on sort of technocratically scuttling the process [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  of tallying the votes. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=278.44s)]
*  And when you say soon, I mean, we're talking about early voting starts, advanced voting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  starts October 15. So we're talking about in a matter of weeks, not November. We're [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  talking about October voting. They're still trying to pass rules that will make it difficult [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  to certify. This feels like it's not a it's not a 50 state problem. It is a Georgia problem [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=294.18s)]
*  because of Republican control, maybe a Pennsylvania problem, Republican secretary of state. But [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=299.86s)]
*  all they would need is like one or two states with enough electoral votes to bring it short [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=304.18s)]
*  of 270. Right? Like that's the nightmare scenario that somehow we end up because one state just [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=308.06s)]
*  doesn't certify at all. We go into the electoral college and no one has 270 or we wind up in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=313.5s)]
*  court cases. Brad Raffensperger suing this election board and taking it to the Supreme [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=319.34s)]
*  Court. Either way, that's two out of three ways Trump loses the election and still could [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=323.94s)]
*  be president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  But I mean, potentially it's it's a very unsettling scenario when you get into those nitty gritty [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  hypotheticals about how this might work. I mean, what would happen? The Electoral Court [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  Count Reform Act, which was passed after what happened on January 6th, it says that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=339.86s)]
*  the states have to have certified election results by December 11th. Doesn't say, though, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=344.82s)]
*  what happens if they don't. And if part of the reason they don't is because it's tied [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=349.22s)]
*  up in courts and the courts can't be encouraged to meet those deadlines, the prospect arises [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=354.42s)]
*  in which a state like Georgia or some other state that tries this essentially doesn't [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  forward its electoral votes to Washington. What would happen then theoretically is that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=366.38s)]
*  the number of electoral votes you'd need to win the presidency would be reduced. It wouldn't [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=371.34s)]
*  be 270. It would be some smaller number. And theoretically, you could get there with us. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=375.74s)]
*  You could get there even if you had not been able to get there, had all the states votes [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=382.5s)]
*  been counted. So I mean, it's the worry that you have about the courts is the worry that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=387.18s)]
*  I share, Joy, that this could be something where just delay, just obfuscation, just confusion, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=392.18s)]
*  just muddying the waters could preclude a state from having a clear result by the time [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=398.18s)]
*  the country needs them to have a clear result. And they feel very confident in their chances [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  once it gets into the courts. And I think that's ultimately the goal of what they're [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=409.44s)]
*  doing. And the thing, the bottom line to this, and it's something that you talk a lot about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=412.58s)]
*  on the MADDO show and we talk about a lot about just in our little circle, is that you [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=417.06s)]
*  have a party that doesn't believe in winning power through elections. They don't believe [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=421.34s)]
*  fundamentally in democracy. They just believe in having power. And so that means really [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=424.9s)]
*  there is no limit to what they'd be willing to do to get it. And they really don't care [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=428.74s)]
*  whether that means they won an election or not. That's immaterial to them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=432.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, when Trump won the Republican primary in 2016, he said it was rigged. When [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=435.9s)]
*  he won the general election in 2016, he said it was rigged. Before he ran for reelection [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=443.3s)]
*  in 2020, he said it was rigged. When he lost, he said it was rigged. He's already saying [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=448.53999999999996s)]
*  2024 is rigged. He doesn't think that elections are a real thing. He doesn't think that elections [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=451.58s)]
*  are legitimate. And he doesn't want an American form of government in which elections decide [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=456.65999999999997s)]
*  whether or not he's in power because he doesn't believe election results should be binding. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=461.88s)]
*  And so that's what it boils down to when you talk about people saying democracy is on the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=466.62s)]
*  ballot. That's what it is. But the nuts and bolts way it plays out is with what is now [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=470.14s)]
*  a whole of Republican Party strategy to say, you know, we're likely not going to have any [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=474.98s)]
*  election results and we're going to have to figure this out some other way, either with [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=480.38s)]
*  the Republicans in Congress or the Republican-leaning courts. We're going to have them sort this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=484.14s)]
*  out rather than the American people. That's the nuts and bolts way this thing gets worked [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=488.7s)]
*  out. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=493.14s)]
*  This is why we say scaring is caring on this show. It's kind of our theme. We scare to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cVhI31gXRA&t=494.06s)]
