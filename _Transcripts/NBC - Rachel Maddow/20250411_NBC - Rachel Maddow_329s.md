# 'No other rhyme or reason': Trump-inflicted damage to Social Security points to system's destruction
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY)
*  Joining us now is Alex Lawson, executive director of the nonprofit Social Security Works. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Lawson, thanks very much for being with us tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=8.24s)]
*  So we've been following what we can about what the Trump administration is doing to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=10.48s)]
*  the Social Security administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=13.8s)]
*  We've also been following these anecdotal and journalistic reports about what's happening [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=15.24s)]
*  when real people are running into regular kinds of problems that they would usually [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=18.96s)]
*  sort out by contacting the agency. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=23.48s)]
*  And it does feel like, anecdotally again, it feels like things are in freefall. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=26.2s)]
*  I wanted to just sort of gut check that with you as somebody who watches this agency closely. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=30.96s)]
*  Yeah, for 15 years, you know, I've said, you know, have confidence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=35.24s)]
*  Your checks are going to get into your hands. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  For 90 years, Social Security turns 90 this year, for 90 years, through war and peace, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=44.28s)]
*  through boom and bust, through health and pandemic, not a single payment has been missed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=51.199999999999996s)]
*  But months after this billionaire gets in there, that's changed, Rachel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=57.08s)]
*  And I wish I had a better answer for people, but I don't. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=61.44s)]
*  This is going to the end in checks not going out, the money that we have earned not getting [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=66.28s)]
*  into our hands. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=73.52s)]
*  And I believe strongly that that's the point. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=75.6s)]
*  The cuts they've made have no other rhyme or reason except to literally destroy the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=78.8s)]
*  system. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=85.8s)]
*  We reported this week on the Attorney General's office in Arizona, led by Chris Mays, and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  now today on the Attorney General's office in Michigan, led by Dana Nessel, both setting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  up online one page, very simple web hubs, basically, individual forms online where people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=97.7s)]
*  who are having trouble in those states accessing their Social Security benefits or contacting [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=103.72s)]
*  the agency, they can at least report it to their state Attorney General's office so the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  Attorney General's office can document it so they can potentially act on that information, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=112.02s)]
*  potentially so they can get those people some help. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=116.06s)]
*  I feel like that's good news because somebody's trying and because they've got the resources [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=119.22s)]
*  of a government agency behind them and people can't fix these problems on their own. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=123.06s)]
*  What else is happening to try to help people out, to try to remedy some of the failures [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing because of what Trump's doing to this agency? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=133.1s)]
*  So the truth is that unfortunately people are going to have to take it upon themselves [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=137.02s)]
*  to protect themselves at this point. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=142.36s)]
*  It's great that the Attorneys General in Arizona and Michigan are doing something. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=144.38000000000002s)]
*  But you know, you've seen Republicans in Congress, they're complicit in this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  They're allowing Elon Musk and Donald Trump to destroy the Social Security Administration. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=153.9s)]
*  So we're advising people to make sure they have a hard copy of their benefit, their Social [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=160.02s)]
*  Security file. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=165.78s)]
*  It says their wage history and importantly what their benefit is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=167.46s)]
*  Have a hard copy of that because we're not sure if the online, the digital is going to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=171.78s)]
*  be there after these doge goons are done with their chainsawing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  We also advise people to get in contact with the Constituent Services staff in their federal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=183.06s)]
*  elected representatives offices, both their senators and their representative. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=188.62s)]
*  Now this is the Constituent Services side. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=193.34s)]
*  And get a phone number, get an email, let them know that you're worried about you or [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=196.46s)]
*  your loved one's benefits and want to be able to be in contact with them if a penny is missing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=201.86s)]
*  or if it's late or if it doesn't show up at all. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=208.7s)]
*  And most importantly I think is look for the most vulnerable in your community and in whatever [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=212.22s)]
*  network you're in, a church, a book group, whatever it is, understand that Social Security [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=217.64s)]
*  is a system that relies on us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=224.04s)]
*  It's there for us but it does care for the most vulnerable like a 102 year old, right, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  or somebody who has faced a life changing illness or injury and can no longer work due [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=233.16s)]
*  to disability. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  Make sure that these folks are not alone because a missed check for some people is a death [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  sentence. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=246.2s)]
*  A missed check for some people is going to mean that they are out on the street. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=247.76s)]
*  So we have to come together and understand that when this catastrophic failure happens, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=252.88s)]
*  and I believe it will, there's no indication that they're trying to fix things, just accelerate [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=260.36s)]
*  it, 73 million people rely on Social Security. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=265.84s)]
*  Imagine the chaos that will come when those checks don't go out, Rachel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=270.48s)]
*  It is going to be a scenario that's hard to imagine how catastrophic it will be. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  So much attention in the media on the big dollar things that have been happening around [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=283.44s)]
*  tariffs and the national economy right now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=288.76s)]
*  I think as much or more attention needs to be paid to the small dollar question of those [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=291.28s)]
*  individual monthly checks going to the some of the most vulnerable people in the country. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=296.32s)]
*  This is deadly stuff. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  Alex Lawson, Executive Director of the nonprofit Social Security Works, we'll have you back [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  soon. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=305.8s)]
*  We'd love to keep talking about this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=306.8s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq71wnT6bVY&t=307.8s)]
