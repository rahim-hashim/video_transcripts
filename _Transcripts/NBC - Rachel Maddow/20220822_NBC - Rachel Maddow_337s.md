# Bill Barr Lied About Considering Charging Trump With Obstruction Of Mueller, Court Says
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk)
*  When Mueller turned in that two-volume report to the Justice Department in 2019, he said, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=0.0s)]
*  basically, you know, there's this longstanding written Justice Department policy that says [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=6.36s)]
*  we're not supposed to bring charges against a sitting president, so we're not going [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=11.9s)]
*  to bring charges against this sitting president, but we have nevertheless done this investigation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=15.0s)]
*  We've collected all the facts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=21.0s)]
*  We've preserved the evidentiary record. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=22.12s)]
*  So if charges are warranted here because of Trump's behavior, those criminal charges [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=24.96s)]
*  can be brought against him once he is no longer president, once he is no longer protected [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=31.16s)]
*  by that Justice Department rule that says you can't be criminally charged while you're [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  serving as president of the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=39.4s)]
*  Mueller turned his report into this guy, to Trump Attorney General William Barr. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  That's who received the report from Mueller. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=46.8s)]
*  And right after he got the report, you might remember, William Barr released a statement [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  about it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=54.0s)]
*  Barr said specifically that he was disregarding the Justice Department policy that said a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=55.2s)]
*  sitting president can't be charged with crimes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  He said, I'm not paying attention to that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  He said, regardless of that policy, just ignore that policy, regardless of that rule, I, William [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=66.72s)]
*  Barr, have reviewed all of the evidence, and I have determined that no way should Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=71.4s)]
*  face any charges, not just because he's president, not just because of this rule that says no [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  charges can be brought against a president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=81.72000000000001s)]
*  But regardless of that, Trump shouldn't face any charges because my William Barr review [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=83.56s)]
*  of the evidence in this report indicates that Trump committed no crimes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=88.56s)]
*  Barr tells the Congress, he tells the public, I can tell, I checked it out, I looked at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=94.76s)]
*  all the evidence, I say as attorney general, and the Justice Department backs me up on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  this, this is the professional view of the U.S. Justice Department, Trump did no crimes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  And that's how the whole Mueller report thing ended, right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=109.68s)]
*  I mean, it's over. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=112.16s)]
*  That's how Bill Barr broke the neck of the Mueller investigation in 2019. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=114.24s)]
*  That's why even after Trump left office and he was just an ex-president and therefore [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=120.36s)]
*  he's no longer protected by that Justice Department policy that says you can't charge [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=124.0s)]
*  a sitting president, that's why there was no clamor to charge him then with any of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=127.48s)]
*  gazillion instances of alleged obstruction of justice that were described in great detail [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=133.0s)]
*  in Mueller's report. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  It's because Barr said, he signed his name to it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  He said we looked at everything here, regardless of that rule that says you can't charge him, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump definitely committed no crimes, he should not be charged. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=147.32s)]
*  Barr's letter said, quote, the evidence developed during the special counsel's investigation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=150.92s)]
*  is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=155.0s)]
*  Our determination was made without regard to and is not based on the constitutional [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=159.88s)]
*  considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=164.04s)]
*  That's what Barr did. That's what Barr said. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=172.28s)]
*  Turns out that was a lie. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=175.0s)]
*  At least a federal appeals court in Washington has just ruled that that was a lie. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=176.68s)]
*  According to a unanimous ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  when Robert Mueller turned in his report to the Justice Department, Attorney General Bill Barr [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  and the Justice Department never actually considered at all whether or not Trump committed crimes [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=191.88s)]
*  or whether Trump should be charged. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=197.72s)]
*  They literally never even looked at that possibility, despite what they said they were doing publicly. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=199.72s)]
*  Barr lied, according to the appeals court, and told Congress and the public that the Justice [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  Department did consider that. And after that careful consideration, they definitely concluded [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=211.16s)]
*  Trump committed no crimes and shouldn't be charged. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  But the appeals court says that Barr lied about it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=218.52s)]
*  This is from a, again, unanimous three-judge ruling from the federal appeals court in Washington, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  D.C. Quote, the department's submissions indicated that the memorandum conveyed advice [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=227.24s)]
*  about whether to charge President Trump with a crime. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  But the court's in-camera review of that memorandum revealed that the department, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=236.84s)]
*  in fact, never considered bringing a charge. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=240.84s)]
*  DOJ never, in fact, considered bringing any charges against Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=243.88s)]
*  They never even looked at it. We find out now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=249.4s)]
*  Three years after the Mueller report came out, five years after most of the potentially criminal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=254.2s)]
*  activity described in exquisite detail in that report, they said at the time they considered [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=259.8s)]
*  charges against him and no charges were warranted, but they never actually considered charges [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=265.8s)]
*  against him at all. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=269.8s)]
*  They never once looked at it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  So, you know, that happened. Okay. Apparently we just move on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=278.91999999999996s)]
*  Apparently we just move on because, you know, crimes in high places don't matter much, right? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=286.12s)]
*  And, you know, if you're fully cognizant of the fact that you've gotten away with a bunch of crimes [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  without facing any charges or any consequences for those crimes, probably that has a really [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=297.0s)]
*  cautionary effect on you. So you never try any other potential crimes again, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=302.28s)]
*  I'm sure that's how it works. You think, whoa, close call. I better shape up. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=306.6s)]
*  I'm sure that's how it works. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=312.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBoxuUv36lk&t=327.0s)]
