**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0)
*  And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. It is really nice to be back. It's really really really nice to be back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=0.0s)]
*  If this face does not seem familiar [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=6.66s)]
*  If you are if you are now you're quite used to seeing somebody else at this hour. Hello. It's nice to meet you [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=9.24s)]
*  I'm Rachel. I have been away from the show for a few weeks. I took a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  hiatus to give myself a little reset and also to work on some other MSNBC projects that I've got cooking [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=19.86s)]
*  I got to tell you the hiatus has been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=27.76s)]
*  Fantastic. I am really really grateful for it. I know it is an unusual thing to get in this business [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=31.12s)]
*  I'm very grateful to MSNBC and MSNBC's president for letting me do it [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm profoundly grateful to the staff on this show for keeping everything running for doing such great work while I was gone and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=41.36s)]
*  As as Chris mentioned there I am also grateful almost beyond words for Ali Velshi in particular and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=49.2s)]
*  For my other colleagues who filled in for me while I was away [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=57.0s)]
*  If you can't tell from the way that all the rest of us talk about him [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=60.72s)]
*  You should know that Ali Velshi really is a prince among men [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=64.0s)]
*  He has been in Ukraine and in bordering countries for five straight weeks [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=68.4s)]
*  covering the war [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=73.08s)]
*  Hosting this show hosting his own show. He's been doing just incredible work literally around the clock all the while just being a great and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=74.62s)]
*  Generous and upstanding person and a great co-worker to everyone. He works with while he was doing it [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=83.56s)]
*  I'm telling you you should be so lucky to ever have a co-worker as great as Ali Velshi [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=89.18s)]
*  We are incredibly lucky to have him here at MSNBC [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  And I'm really really grateful that he helmed things so ably while I was gone [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=97.28s)]
*  I sort of feel like I have big shoes to fill coming back [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=102.42s)]
*  Given what a good job he's been doing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=105.56s)]
*  But I am back [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=108.12s)]
*  I said when I left before that I might eventually be taking another hiatus later on this year that things were fluid [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=109.48s)]
*  We'd be taking it one step at a time. That is all still true ish [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=116.92s)]
*  but [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=120.6s)]
*  One of the things I realized while I was on hiatus [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=122.32s)]
*  Working on these other projects these past few weeks one of the things I realized to my surprise [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=125.92s)]
*  Is that I actually don't really need another hiatus. This one was great, but I think I only needed the one I [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=131.2s)]
*  Do still have all these other irons in the fire all these other things [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=139.04s)]
*  I'm working on that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to bring to fruition none of them are fast all of them take a long time and I'm still working on all [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  Of them, but I don't think I need another big stretch of time off [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=147.22s)]
*  So here's the plan [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=151.32s)]
*  I'm back. I'm gonna be here all this month Monday through Thursday nights [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Now for big news events for things like the lead-up to the election. I will of course be here more than that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=160.56s)]
*  But that is the general plan I will be here this month Monday through Thursday nights [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=165.88s)]
*  And then starting next month starting in May. I'm gonna be here weekly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=172.28s)]
*  I'm gonna be here on Monday nights again to give myself [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=176.94s)]
*  Just more time to work on some of this other stuff that I've got cooking for MSNBC and NBC [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=180.28s)]
*  So Monday to Thursday nights this month starting next month. I will be I will be here weekly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=185.84s)]
*  And again, you know this might change [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=192.72s)]
*  We will see how things go [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=195.4s)]
*  But that is the plan as of now. So now you know and we will never speak of it again [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=197.68s)]
*  Enough of that. Let's start the show. We got a lot of get-to tonight [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=203.4s)]
*  Mr. Kara Mertz apparently haunts the dreams of Vladimir Putin [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=207.38s)]
*  The first major opposition figure to emerge as a potential rival to Vladimir Putin was an entrepreneur billionaire [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=212.8s)]
*  Who ran the one Russian oil company that actually knew what it was doing his name was Mikhail Khodorkovsky [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=220.64s)]
*  I actually wrote about this extensively in a book that I wrote a couple of years ago called blowout if you ever want to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=226.68s)]
*  Read this backstory here. I think it is an amazing story [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  But basically this guy this entrepreneur billionaire guy. He became the richest businessman in Russia. He then challenged Putin [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=235.92s)]
*  He made this public challenge that Russia needs to be a real democracy and the government [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=243.88s)]
*  Needs to stop stealing everything and stop being so corrupt [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  That was such a threat to Vladimir Putin that Putin had him arrested on made-up charges [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=251.2s)]
*  Seized his company and took it for himself. And then Putin had the guy locked up in prison for a decade [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  After he got out of prison at the end of a decade. He fled the country. He now lives in exile [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=265.08s)]
*  But Mikhail Khodorkovsky [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=270.96s)]
*  Founded a pro-democracy group that operates internationally. It's called open Russia [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=272.88s)]
*  And it advocates for democracy in Russia for civil society. It advocates against corruption in in Russia [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=277.92s)]
*  That of course is very threatening to Vladimir Putin after Khodorkovsky himself threatened him [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=284.24s)]
*  Putin was then threatened by the organization that Khodorkovsky founded and so Putin of course had the organization banned [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=288.96s)]
*  He had open Russia declared illegal, but until open Russia was banned. The guy who was running it was Vladimir Kara Marza [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=295.48s)]
*  And he keeps popping up in places like this the next real credible rival to Vladimir Putin was this man a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  Charismatic opposition politician named Boris Nemtsov [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=311.48s)]
*  Nemtsov was brilliant really well spoken. He was a physicist by training. He was six foot five [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=314.8s)]
*  He'd held a lot of different prominent public offices in Russia including being deputy prime minister and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=320.44000000000005s)]
*  He emerged ultimately as this outspoken crusader against corruption in the Russian government [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=326.04s)]
*  And so naturally just like Khodorkovsky before him [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Boris Nemtsov emerged as a huge threat to Putin for one thing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  He was another real credible challenger to Putin and so of course he had to go to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  With him they didn't go through the trouble that they went through with the oil guy [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=348.36s)]
*  They didn't go through the trouble of arresting him and jailing him and stealing his company and exiling him [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=352.48s)]
*  For Boris Nemtsov they went a simpler route. They just killed him four bullets in the back [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=358.94s)]
*  For Boris Nemtsov as he walked along the street just outside the Kremlin that was in 2015 [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  But here too again we find our friend Vladimir Kara Marza [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=371.02s)]
*  There is a foundation named for Boris Nemtsov it supports journalism supports freedom of the press every year [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=375.26s)]
*  They give the Boris Nemtsov prize for courage in upholding democratic values [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=380.42s)]
*  Vladimir Kurtz Kara Marza runs that foundation he ran the foundation that was founded by [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=386.24s)]
*  Mikhail Khodorkovsky he ran the foundation he runs the foundation founded in the name of Boris Nemtsov. I [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=392.04s)]
*  Mean the pattern here is clear [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=398.48s)]
*  part of the way Vladimir Putin stays in power in Russia is that he keeps imprisoning and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=401.08000000000004s)]
*  Killing all the opposition figures in Russia. They've got Alexei Navalny in jail now [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  After nearly killing him with poison the head Mikhail Khodorkovsky in jail for a decade now, he's in exile [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  Boris Nemtsov they had him just gunned down in the street [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=417.88s)]
*  But the opposition it it keeps trying it keeps going [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=421.88s)]
*  Vladimir Kara Marza [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=426.88s)]
*  linked to all these opposition figures a very high profile opposition figure in his own right [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=428.72s)]
*  Carrying on the work of all these killed and imprisoned leaders to keep the opposition alive [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=434.16s)]
*  in Russia [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=439.24s)]
*  Literally alive and politically alive and he has paid the price for it too in 2015 [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=441.48s)]
*  Vladimir Kara Marza was poisoned him to multiple organ failure [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  He had to learn to walk again [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=452.56s)]
*  It took him a year and a half to recover when he was poisoned in 2015, but he lived [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  Then two years later. He was traveling in Russia inside Russia promoting a documentary about the life and the assassination of Boris Nemtsov [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=459.36s)]
*  Somehow Vladimir Kara Marza was poisoned again [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=468.16s)]
*  Twice in two years again in and out of a coma [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=472.92s)]
*  Multiple organ failure again his wife somehow got him out of Russia and into the United States for him to try to recover here [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=476.16s)]
*  Doctors here told her that he had a 5% chance of survival [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=483.48s)]
*  but he survived and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=488.48s)]
*  In 2017 as he was still recovering from that second assassination attempt [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=491.6s)]
*  In fact, he was he was right here on this show [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=496.32s)]
*  We saw the offices of Alexei Navalny's organization [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=501.48s)]
*  Get ransacked and have all their computers and all their paperwork and all their staff getting arrested [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=506.2s)]
*  Open Russia getting banned this week the raid on your offices there this week. I mean how [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=511.44s)]
*  how do you maintain any sort of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=517.0s)]
*  Momentum any sort of organizing structure against that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=521.52s)]
*  Well, I mean the other side if you if you just look at it formally the other side [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=525.24s)]
*  Of course does have a massive advantage right they have all the so-called law enforcement agencies. They have the entire propaganda machine [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=528.72s)]
*  They have the whole power of the state on their side. But what we have I think is something much more important and that is the truth [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=534.12s)]
*  as Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine grinds on now [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  written what day 44 day 45 [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=545.32s)]
*  As tonight we feel the first [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=549.08s)]
*  Unconfirmed reports that Russian forces may have used a chemical weapon in Ukraine as [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=551.12s)]
*  the number of Russians arrested for opposing Putin's war [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=556.64s)]
*  dwarfs the number of arrests we saw even from the big opposition protests in Russia in 2012 and 2017 as [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=561.12s)]
*  Putin has now eliminated the last vestiges of the independent press in that country as he has made it a criminal act to even call [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=567.84s)]
*  the war in Ukraine a war as [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=574.96s)]
*  Thousands tens of thousands of Russian citizens have fled their own country probably permanently [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=577.64s)]
*  To escape Putin and what he is doing now to Russia as he wages this war [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=583.08s)]

*  When he spoke with Ali just yesterday, I don't want to say that he knew it was coming [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=626.76s)]
*  But he knew he was in Russia at this time still speaking his mind and he was eyes open facing it head-on [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=633.16s)]
*  Are you worried about speaking out against the Russian government and against this war and invasion from Russia? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=642.88s)]
*  We all know the price we all know the cost but we also know [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=648.76s)]
*  That there are millions of people in Russia who categorically oppose Putin regime and everything is doing both in terms of domestic repression [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  And in terms of the external aggression we know that there are many people in Russia [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=659.76s)]
*  Who want our country to be a normal modern democratic European state? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=663.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it'll be very demoralizing with those of us who are sort of the public faces of the pro-democracy movement of the opposition [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=668.4s)]

*  Other opposition activists in Russia have reportedly gone tonight with a police station where they believe he may have been taken [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=715.52s)]
*  They are calling for his release [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=722.12s)]
*  We'll let you know more as we learn more [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=724.84s)]
*  I bet you remember this photo this crazy photo this photo remember this [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=728.12s)]
*  This photo was taken on Donald Trump's very first visit to the United States [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=734.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's very first foreign trip of his presidency [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=739.04s)]
*  His first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia. That's the king of Saudi Arabia in the middle there the guy in yellow who looks surprised [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=743.36s)]
*  Again, this was Trump's very first foreign visit as president [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=750.8s)]
*  No other American president ever made Saudi Arabia their first foreign trip, but Trump did [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=753.76s)]
*  And that kind of set the tone for a lot of really unusual favors and special treatment for Saudi Arabia [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=760.04s)]
*  During Trump's one beleaguered term in office [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=766.4s)]
*  Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner was at the helm of most of those decisions most of that special treatment [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=771.08s)]
*  Mr. Kushner himself made at least three trips to Saudi Arabia [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=777.24s)]
*  Just during Trump's first year in office and I say it was at least three because we don't know about all his trips [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=780.68s)]
*  Maybe of those three one of them Kushner flew there secretly [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=786.98s)]
*  We didn't learn about it until after he was back long after it was over [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=791.24s)]
*  That was the trip that reportedly included several nights where Jared Kushner and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=794.96s)]
*  Mohammed bin Salman he goes by MBS [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  Jared and MBS reportedly stayed up till four in the morning [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=803.12s)]
*  swapping stories and planning strategy and quote [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=807.0s)]
*  Shortly after Jared Kushner got back from that trip the Saudi Crown Prince MBS [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=811.6s)]
*  rounded up literally hundreds of members of the royal family and other rich Saudis and basically jailed them including [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=816.9200000000001s)]
*  Torturing some of them in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Riyadh until lots of them were forced to give up billions of dollars and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=823.0s)]
*  Any claims to power they might have? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=830.0799999999999s)]
*  And MBS didn't just have tacit support from the Trump White House for that bizarre crackdown [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=832.88s)]
*  President Trump explicitly tweeted his approval of it [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=838.36s)]
*  Trump also incredibly [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=842.04s)]
*  Supported Saudi Arabia's weird economic blockade of their neighbor Qatar [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=844.04s)]
*  Even though Qatar is a staunch US ally and they host a gigantic US military base that houses 10,000 American troops [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=848.88s)]
*  Saudi Arabia launched this big blockade of Qatar and Trump said okay. I'm on the Saudi side really [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=856.96s)]
*  Trump even bent over backwards to prevent Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=863.72s)]
*  journalist Jamal Khashoggi an operation that US intelligence concluded was personally approved by MBS himself [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=871.24s)]
*  Trump later told journalist Bob Woodward about MBS quote I saved his [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=878.2s)]
*  bass [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=884.24s)]
*  Quote I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=885.76s)]
*  Why why did you do that it was so strange and so blatant why are why is the United States government doing this? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  Why is our government going out of their way not just to excuse and paper over but to really prop up this guy? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=898.74s)]
*  How does this work? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=904.28s)]
*  While the Trump administration was giving the Saudi Crown Prince everything he wanted and more [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=907.24s)]
*  Trump's Treasury Secretary the guy in charge of money for the Trump administration [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=912.16s)]
*  Steven Mnuchin he kept making ever more frequent trips to go see MBS even after the Jamal Khashoggi murder [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  In fact in the very last days of the Trump administration [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=924.8s)]
*  Mnuchin took it lap took one last taxpayer funded overseas junket to go visit Saudi Arabia [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=928.0s)]
*  He had to cut that trip short because of the attack on the US Capitol on January 6th [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=933.6s)]
*  But not too short even after that he stretched it out a couple more days because he wanted to squeeze in one last meeting [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=938.6400000000001s)]
*  with MBS [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=945.32s)]
*  Well now we know just how well all that hard work paid off the New York Times is reporting now [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=947.4000000000001s)]
*  That just six months after Trump left office Saudi Arabia gave Steven Mnuchin a billion dollars [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  Saudi Arabia put a billion dollars into a brand new investment fund [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=958.84s)]
*  Created by Mr.. Mnuchin that money came out of a Saudi government fund controlled by MBS. I [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=963.8s)]
*  mean [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=970.6s)]
*  Services rendered right a billion dollars for a job well done when you were a public official [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=971.88s)]
*  Serving in the Trump administration, but here's the thing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  Steven Mnuchin the money guy from Trump's cabinet. Yes [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=980.88s)]
*  He got a billion dollars from the Saudis six months after leaving office [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=983.78s)]
*  But we now know that at about the same time the Saudis gave [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=988.2s)]
*  two billion dollars to Jared [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=992.72s)]
*  To Trump's son-in-law and White House senior advisor Jared Kushner according to this new reporting from the New York Times [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=996.28s)]
*  MBS gave this two billion dollars to Jared Kushner's new investment venture [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1002.2s)]
*  Despite all the advisors for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1009.8s)]
*  Advising against giving Jared the money the Saudi advisors who oversee the fund looked at Jared's proposal and according to internal documents obtained by the New [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1013.4s)]
*  York Times their response was basically yeah, why would we invest in this? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1021.76s)]
*  Jared Kushner has no experience in this kind of investing none [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1026.36s)]
*  Also, there are no other investors in this thing at all besides us and our due diligence on their operations [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1032.32s)]
*  Quote shows that they are unsatisfactory in all aspects in all aspects [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1040.48s)]
*  That's it MBS staffers at the Saudi fund told these advisors don't worry [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1049.44s)]
*  We've told them that after the first five hundred million dollars [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1054.56s)]
*  They really really have to hire some people who know what they're doing before they get the other billion and a half [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1058.8s)]
*  You know after that, you know fingers crossed I'll figure out how to manage the other one point five billion dollars [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1065.6s)]
*  We're giving them but will condition the first five hundred million on them actually setting up a company that hires some people who know [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1071.1999999999998s)]
*  To how to do what Jared is asking us for this money for I? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1078.52s)]
*  Mean at least with Steven Mnuchin. He was technically an investor. He had been the Treasury Secretary [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1084.0s)]
*  I mean he had a money-shaped hole in which you could insert a billion dollars, right? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1089.24s)]
*  He was like a money guy, but Jared Kushner [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1094.24s)]
*  He ran his dad's real estate firm for a while when it got into money trouble [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1097.64s)]
*  Mean with Mnuchin the deal still stinks to high heaven [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1103.72s)]
*  But on paper at least he kind of makes sense as a place for the Saudi government to park some money, maybe [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1106.44s)]
*  The Saudi government though then gave Jared Kushner twice as much money on more favorable terms on the vague [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1113.24s)]
*  Hope that Jared will eventually hire people to do the actual work of you know managing their investment [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1119.56s)]
*  Why was Jared worth twice as much as the billion dollars they gave Mnuchin [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1127.08s)]
*  Well, presumably in his case. It's not just services rendered but services to be rendered. There's always the prospect that Donald Trump [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1133.3999999999999s)]
*  Might be president again. Who knows if Trump would pick the same cabinet secretaries again [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1140.9599999999998s)]
*  Who knows if Steven Mnuchin would get the job back again, but he'll presumably have the same son-in-law [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1144.98s)]
*  So maybe it's payment for services rendered and also services to come [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  When one of the skeptical Saudi advisors asked why they couldn't at least cut back the amount they were giving Jared [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1154.94s)]
*  MBS's staff replied that the whole point was to quote form a strategic relationship with this new fund and its founder Jared Kushner and [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1160.58s)]
*  Cutting back the two billion dollar stake. They were giving him could screw that up [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1168.14s)]
*  The Saudi government under MBS [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1175.06s)]
*  giving Jared Kushner two billion dollars [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1177.7s)]
*  Really does look like not just payment for services rendered but also a down payment for services expected [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1181.1s)]
*  If you had to explain corruption if you had to explain being compromised by a foreign power [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1187.42s)]
*  To like a seven-year-old this would be a good coloring book to start with [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1193.78s)]
*  What are we as a country supposed to do about a situation like this? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1198.9s)]
*  You [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZGqb3I3i0&t=1204.98s)]
