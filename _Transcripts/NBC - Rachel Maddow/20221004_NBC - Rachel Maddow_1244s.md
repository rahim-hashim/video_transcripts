# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 3
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8)
*  In the sedition trial that got underway today in Washington, D.C., the biggest sedition trial in America in 80 years of five members of the right-wing Trump pro-Trump paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, including their leader. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=0.0s)]
*  There's not much in dispute about the facts of the case. The Oath Keepers did descend on D.C. on January 6. They brought guns and ammo and even hand grenades with them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=12.0s)]
*  Today, prosecutors played an audio recording of the group's leader regretting they didn't bring the guns to the Capitol itself. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=21.0s)]
*  They played a recording of him saying, quote, My only regret is they should have brought rifles. We could have fixed it right there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=27.0s)]
*  And then Oath Keepers in their little fake military uniforms, they definitely did storm into the Capitol in military formation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=33.0s)]
*  Prosecutors say once inside, they split up into two teams fanning out to go hunt down individual lawmakers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=40.0s)]
*  And after January 6, the group's leader definitely did keep buying weapons and messaging fellow Oath Keepers about continuing to try to block President Biden from taking office. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=47.0s)]
*  None of that is really in dispute in this trial. New York Times reporter Alan Foyer, who was in the courthouse as the sedition trial kicked off today, he put it this way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=57.0s)]
*  He said, quote, My only excuse me, he said, quote, Because of the government's wealth of evidence, the trial is less likely to focus on disputes over what the group did in the days and weeks leading up to January 6 than it is to hinge on the question of why they did it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=66.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Alan Foyer. He's covering the trial for the New York Times. Mr. Foyer, I appreciate you being here. Thanks for your time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=81.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=87.0s)]
*  So can you explain that last point that the dispute in the courtroom is going to be less about what they did and more about why they did it? Why is that? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=88.0s)]
*  Sure. So it's going to get down to a question of intent, right? So there's tons of evidence that after the election, Stuart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, was very vocal about not wanting to let Joe Biden get into office. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=97.0s)]
*  The government says that is evidence that they had a conspiracy afoot to stop the lawful transfer of power. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=111.0s)]
*  The defense says, no, that's more of a free speech issue. The why of it, you know, the government, you know, no one disputes that the Oath Keepers, you know, had this armed quick reaction for stationed in hotel rooms across the Potomac River in Virginia, kind of at the ready should things go wrong on January 6. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=117.0s)]
*  And, you know, the government says, hey, that's evidence that they had this plot afoot to stop the transfer of power again. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=138.0s)]
*  The defense says, no, it had nothing to do with that. Those armed Oath Keepers were stationed in those hotel rooms awaiting orders from President Trump to invoke a revolutionary era law called the Insurrection Act that would have given them the legal standing as a militia to come to Trump's office. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=145.0s)]
*  And that's the way that the Oath Keepers were stated. Again, it's a question of intent. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=168.0s)]
*  In terms of that Insurrection Act argument, sometimes the way these things go in federal trials, I know, is that the judge will rule in advance. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=172.0s)]
*  He or she will hear motions in advance about essentially the admissibility of a particular argument in addition to the admissibility of particular evidence. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=181.0s)]
*  Yes, you can make that kind of argument. No, you can't make that kind of argument. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=191.0s)]
*  Has this issue of the Insurrection Act potentially sort of legalizing their otherwise illegal actions? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=194.0s)]
*  Is that something that has been litigated thus far in the trial or is this essentially them trying it for the first time in front of the jury and nobody quite knows if it's going to fly? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=200.0s)]
*  It was absolutely litigated beforehand. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=210.0s)]
*  The judge set kind of specific limits on how this defense could be raised. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=212.0s)]
*  And again, it had to be raised as an issue of intent. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=219.0s)]
*  There is a defense called a public authority defense where someone charged with a crime says, hey, I thought I was following the law when I was breaking this crime or I thought I was acting under the authority of a government official. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=223.0s)]
*  And that's a sort of closely related but separate thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=238.0s)]
*  What the oath keepers are saying here is they believed there in their minds, they believed that it would have been legal for them to bring their weapons over the river and come to the aid of their compatriots at the Capitol had Trump invoked the Insurrection Act. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=242.0s)]
*  And what's interesting about that, aside from the sort of novel and very risky, frankly, defense they're raising is you mentioned before that there have been sedition cases in the past going back, you know, civil war cases through, you know, the wobblies, the radical unionists through sort of war resistors, you know, on up to Islamic terrorists. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=259.0s)]
*  Nobody, none of the and no one charged with seditious conspiracy has ever tried to ally themselves with the chief executive of the government while charged with seeking to use force against the government. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=281.0s)]
*  That's the real kind of weird and new thing here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=297.0s)]
*  The New York Times today reporting that if the Republicans do take over the House, at least eight congressional committees are due to be chaired by members of Congress who voted to not certify the election results who voted to overturn the election results and keep Trump in power, despite the vote. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=301.0s)]
*  These are all members of Congress who took that vote after the Capitol attack on January 6, they'll be running eight of the most important committees in the US Congress. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=318.0s)]
*  And also, this is the Supreme Court term just started today, in which the new conservative super majority on the Supreme Court has gone out of their way to put a case before themselves on something called the independent state legislature doctrine, which is a thing that I swear to you is is well and truly boring. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=328.0s)]
*  The more you read about it, the more suffer if you will feel. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=348.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just boring, particularly if you're not a lawyer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=352.0s)]
*  However, what the independent state legislature doctrine could do what this case could do now that these Supreme Court justices have asked to hear a case about it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=354.0s)]
*  Is it effectively could give Republicans in state legislatures, the power to do what Trump demanded that they do in 2020. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=365.0s)]
*  It could give Republican controlled state legislatures the power to decide what the election results will be from that state, regardless of how the people of that state voted, which is what Trump demanded of Republican state legislators after 2020. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=374.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court case that's before the court for this term could potentially legalize the illegal unconstitutional scheme that Trump was demanding of Republicans who supported him to hand him the electors from states that he in fact lost. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=389.0s)]
*  So this is quite a moment, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=406.0s)]
*  I mean, at a time when we've got the biggest sedition trial in 80 years underway in Washington, I'm doing a podcast about the last sedition threat like this from the late thirties and the early forties in order to find the closest precedent to what we're facing today. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=411.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=425.0s)]
*  While that is happening in Washington as of today, we're not just closing in on an election where people who deny that we should have real election results anymore are trying to take over. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=426.0s)]
*  We're also today starting a new Supreme Court session with a court that has never had a lower level of respect from the American people in the entire time that pollsters have been asking the American people about their level of respect for the court. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=435.0s)]
*  With the new conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, they are reaching way out this term, way, way out of their way to take cases that are expected to serve as a vehicle for them to let state legislatures change election results. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=448.0s)]
*  To get rid of affirmative action programs and education, to get rid of anti-discrimination civil rights laws that protect gay people, and to once and for all get rid of the crown jewel achievement of the United States civil rights movement, which of course is the Voting Rights Act. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=463.0s)]
*  Conservatives on the court already took away the heart of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=477.0s)]
*  Now with the case they're going to hear tomorrow, they could pave the way to hollow out all the rest of it, too. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=482.0s)]
*  That case they're going to hear tomorrow is a case out of Alabama. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=487.0s)]
*  Alabama has a population that's more than a quarter African American, but the Republicans who control the Alabama state legislature want only one of the state's congressional districts to have a majority black electorate. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=490.0s)]
*  Under the Voting Rights Act, even a very conservative court with two Trump-appointed judges told Alabama that they couldn't do that, that that's an illegal infringement on the voting rights of black voters. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=503.0s)]
*  You can't have more than a quarter of your population be African American and then have six of your seven congressional seats be in majority white districts. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=517.0s)]
*  The Voting Rights Act, even hollowed out as it is, prevents them from doing something that extreme. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=526.0s)]
*  That's the court ruling that is controlling in that case right now, but the Supreme Court has nevertheless chosen to wait in. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=532.0s)]
*  With the expectation being that they're going to tell Alabama and the rest of the country to go ahead, do what you want. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=539.0s)]
*  There's no need to worry about that pesky Voting Rights Act anymore. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=545.0s)]
*  And if you think that is too radical a thing to imagine them doing, I mean this is the court that just overruled Roe v. Wade, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=549.0s)]
*  A recent Gallup poll shows that American, the American people say their trust in the court has dropped 20 points just since 2020, just in the past two years. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=559.0s)]
*  Another poll, similar poll from Marquette Law School shows it's dropped 26 points in the past two years. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=568.0s)]
*  If the perception of the court keeps dropping like that, you might think the court would start to get worried that Americans soon just won't respect the court enough to follow its rulings anymore, which of course would be a disaster for the country. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=575.0s)]
*  That would literally be the end of the rule of law in a very fundamental way. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=587.0s)]
*  But if there's one thing we can be sure of, it is that we are playing with the fundamentals in lots of ways these days, pushing ourselves right up to the edge and occasionally over it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=593.0s)]
*  And we all know enough history to know that we have pushed ourselves far, very far in the past as well. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=603.0s)]
*  But these fights to hold on to our constitutional republic, they don't win themselves. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=612.0s)]
*  The Constitution isn't a self-healing document. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=617.0s)]
*  Prosecutions for this kind of stuff, even when they happen, they are hard to win and they are not the end all be all for accountability. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=621.0s)]
*  Whether you are volunteering for a candidate who's running this year or maybe you're running for office yourself or you're volunteering as a poll worker or you're door knocking for the latest good government pro-democracy initiative that's on the table, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=630.0s)]
*  or you're running for a democracy initiative that's on the ballot where you live, whatever you are doing right now, particularly over these next six weeks, you are part of what will decide what happens next in our country. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=640.0s)]
*  The outcome is not at all certain at this point. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=652.0s)]
*  We are in the middle of all of it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=655.0s)]
*  And good luck to us all. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=658.0s)]
*  The start of a new Supreme Court term is typically an exciting moment. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=660.0s)]
*  But this one feels less like the kind of excitement you get from the first day of school and more like the kind of excitement you get when you're trying to take a picture of a scenic vista at the top of a very perilous cliff and the railing at the edge of the cliff that you're leaning on breaks while you're taking the picture and you fall into the abyss. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=664.0s)]
*  This year feels exciting that way. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=679.0s)]
*  Public trust in the United States Supreme Court to make fair decisions, to do its job, has never been lower. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=682.0s)]
*  In a survey from Gallup, the only group that trusts the federal judiciary right now is the red line there, Republicans, Democrats, independents. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=689.0s)]
*  With Democrats and independents, they're below 50 percent. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=699.0s)]
*  A new poll by Marquette Law School shows that the American public's approval of the Supreme Court specifically has dropped 26 points in two years. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=702.0s)]
*  And this isn't a popularity contest. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=711.0s)]
*  This isn't just a sad tale about people not liking the court. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=714.0s)]
*  This is a story about our country. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=717.0s)]
*  If Americans do wholesale lose faith in the court, what's the consequence of that? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=719.0s)]
*  I mean, how long before we are at risk of this unspeakable thing in which the American people no longer consent to follow the court's rulings? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=726.0s)]
*  If we're not going to follow them, what do we follow instead? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=736.0s)]
*  What's the law if court rulings no longer hold sway because the courts are no longer seen as legitimate? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=739.0s)]
*  This is all happening, of course, in the wake of the decision to overturn Roe versus Wade, an unimaginable, very unpopular benchmark, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=747.0s)]
*  that we have nevertheless passed and are living with now. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=754.0s)]
*  For the term that starts today, the conservative supermajority on the court has sought out cases that could continue reshaping life as we know it in terms almost as fundamental as Roe. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=757.0s)]
*  Affirmative action, gay rights, voting rights, whether state legislatures get to decide elections on their own say so. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=768.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, the court will hear a Voting Rights Act case out of Alabama where more than a quarter of the voting age population is African-American, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=775.0s)]
*  but six out of seven congressional districts are majority white. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=782.0s)]
*  This case that the court is hearing tomorrow has the potential, bottom line, to undo congressional districts with black or brown lawmakers in every single state in the union. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=785.0s)]
*  In her new book, Lady Justice, which is really good, my favorite court watcher in all the land, Dahlia Lithwick, writes about how women in particular are on tenterhooks right now, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=796.0s)]
*  fully aware of how much is at risk and the radicalism of the moment that we are facing. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=809.0s)]
*  Dahlia Lithwick writes in the conclusion to her book, quote, We are in a truly frightening moment. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=814.0s)]
*  Election deniers are laying the tracks to set aside the 2024 election and the Supreme Court has for the first time in history reversed precedent in order to take away freedom rather than expand it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=819.0s)]
*  The court works ever harder to limit voting rights. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=829.0s)]
*  States punish LGBTQ families and ban books in schools. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=832.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court will hear a case affording state legislatures the right to determine election outcomes, the discredited legal theory deployed to try to set aside the 2020 contest. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=837.0s)]
*  This will not be reversed in a year or maybe even a decade. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=846.0s)]
*  She says, quote, I don't believe women sleep through revanchist backsliding any easier than they sleep through colic. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=850.0s)]
*  We hear things. We see things. We are awake. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=858.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor at Slate. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=863.0s)]
*  She's the author of Lady Justice, Women, the Law and the Battle to Save America. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=867.0s)]
*  Dahlia, it's great to see you here. It's good to be back. It's really nice to have you here in person. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=871.0s)]
*  We're awfully cheerful, the two of us. Sorry. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=875.0s)]
*  You want to hear some more Nazi stories? You usually I'm the depressive on the two of us. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=878.0s)]
*  But man, you really set the bar low. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=884.0s)]
*  I mean, the point is, though, that we should not see our current challenges as unprecedented challenges that we have had very, very difficult moments, including on constitutional fundamentals in the past. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=886.0s)]
*  And it takes a lot. It takes not just the courts. It takes not just the Justice Department. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=898.0s)]
*  It takes not just jail for bad guys to fix these things. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=903.0s)]
*  And I feel like in Lady Justice and in the way that you're approaching this current court, you're sort of telling a little bit of the same story, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=908.0s)]
*  which is that there's there's there's work to do and there's no silver bullet and telling exactly the same story that you just told, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=914.0s)]
*  which is if you think that winning lawsuits is going to get you there, it's not enough. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=921.0s)]
*  You can win a bunch of lawsuits. In some sense, this book is about a bunch of amazing lawsuits. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=926.0s)]
*  But the last third of the book is about exactly what you're talking about. Organizing, registering voters, structural democracy reform, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=931.0s)]
*  Senate has to be reformed. The Electoral College has to be reformed. We have to think about massive reform to the Supreme Court. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=940.0s)]
*  Those aren't things that are going to get fixed at the midterms and they're not going to get fixed in 2024, assuming the 2024 election plays out the way we hope it does. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=946.0s)]
*  This is really a moment for people to say, what am I doing to protect poll workers? What am I doing to protect teachers? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=955.0s)]
*  How am I going to make sure that the secretary of state race in my state is essential? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=962.0s)]
*  And that's the kind of stuff I think we lose track of. But that's the structural democratic fix that is absolutely essential for everybody to be paying attention. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=967.0s)]
*  And honestly, I mean, this is sort of the time if you are concerned about democracy, if you are concerned about what's happening with the elections in your state. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=976.0s)]
*  Now, today is the day we're just far enough out from the election that you've still got time to ask yourself, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=983.0s)]
*  well, when I tell my kids and my grandkids and I kibitz with my friends about this moment, what am I going to say I did? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=988.0s)]
*  What was my role in helping? How did I participate in trying to hold up this thing that I say I value? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=994.0s)]
*  One of the things that I'm scared about is that one of the things we tell each other about how to make change is to vote. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1002.0s)]
*  I'm very worried about the Voting Rights Act and what they're going to be hearing tomorrow. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1009.0s)]
*  What are your expectations in terms of the dilution of voting rights for minorities and the other threats to voting rights with this court this year? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1014.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's existential. And I think what you said initially is exactly correct, which is this is not the beginning of a process. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1021.0s)]
*  This is a process that began with Shelby County. It began with Citizens United. It began with Bernovich two years ago when Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was circumscribed. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1028.0s)]
*  So this is really what's left of a Voting Rights Act that has been eviscerated by this court. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1038.0s)]
*  And I think if they do what I suspect they're going to do tomorrow and we hear about it in the spring, it's going to be almost impossible to effectuate the rights that were protected, as you said, under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1044.0s)]
*  which was the crown jewel of how we were going to get to fair voting. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1058.0s)]
*  And so I think that if you put that in tandem with the more case that you were talking about, the independent state legislature case, what you are really looking at is an attempt to do in black robes what Donald Trump and John Eastman tried to do in the 2020 election, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1062.0s)]
*  which is say we are going to give state legislatures almost unfettered power to do what they will with elections, to do what they will with gerrymandering, to do what they will with vote suppression, up to and including election denialism, right? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1081.0s)]
*  That is the Harper case. And I think once you're there and it's unreviewable, if it turns out that it's unreviewable by state courts under state constitutions, you are essentially green lighting. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1096.0s)]
*  The thing that didn't happen in 2020 just because it was too soon. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1108.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1112.0s)]
*  If the court, in terms of court legitimacy, which is a term that I think is thrown around a lot without people understanding what it means, if court legitimacy continues to be in flux the way it is now, it feels like it's in freefall actually more than in flux, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1113.0s)]
*  do you think the justices themselves end up starting to worry about people following their orders and people start following their rulings? Do you think they are conscious of that as a threat? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1130.0s)]
*  Rachel, a year ago I would have said yes. A year ago I would have said SB8, the shadow docket, all of the ethics stuff that we saw around Clarence Thomas's wife being involved, at least tangentially, in January 6 and him failing to recuse himself for a case squarely about January 6. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1140.0s)]
*  At any point in that process, up to and including the Dobbs League, I would have said this is a court that is in trouble, the wheels are coming off, they understand there's no Plan B for the rule of law. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1157.0s)]
*  Once it's gone, it's gone for decades. I no longer have any confidence that that's bothering them and I would go so far as to say I think when Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts are scolding us for having conversations about legitimacy rather than asking themselves what they could have done differently, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1167.0s)]
*  I think it's just evidence to me, A, of gaslighting, but B, evidence that they don't care. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1185.0s)]
*  Dahlia Lithwick is the author of Lady Justice, Women, the Law, and the Battle to Save America, and you know, by nature, a very cheery person. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1193.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1201.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKp0qOaQvH8&t=1215.0s)]
