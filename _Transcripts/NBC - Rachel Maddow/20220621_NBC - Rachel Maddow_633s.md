# Trump Was Told Election Workers He Terrorized Was Innocent, Hearings Show
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY)
*  Shea Moss had been a longtime election worker in Fulton County. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=0.0s)]
*  For this election, Fulton County looked like it was going to be short-staffed because of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  COVID. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  So, Ms. Moss recruited her mom to sign up as a temp worker for Election Day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  That video that Trump and company got so fixated on, all that video showed was Shea Moss and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=13.36s)]
*  her mom, these two election workers, literally just doing their jobs on election night, taking [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=19.76s)]
*  ballots out of the secure containers they were transported in, like they were supposed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=23.96s)]
*  to, and running them through the ballot counting machine, like they were supposed to. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=27.68s)]
*  But Trump and Giuliani and all the Trump folks and our friends at Fox News kept running this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=32.64s)]
*  snippet of video over and over again, saying that it showed a crime, even though it actually [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=37.92s)]
*  showed just normal election workers doing normal stuff the normal way with no malfeasance [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=46.6s)]
*  But them fixating on this video, Trump not only showing the video, the conservative media [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=49.56s)]
*  Giuliani showing the video and Trump specifically naming the women in the video as the ones [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  who stole the election from him, that had profound consequences. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=59.84s)]
*  Shea Moss and her mom, even her teenage son, got inundated with vulgar and racist harassment [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=64.04s)]
*  and death threats. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=71.04s)]
*  Shea Moss's mother called 911 multiple times because people were showing up at her house [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=73.04s)]
*  with some banging on her door, making threats in person. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=78.48s)]
*  Lord Jesus, where's the police? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=108.48s)]
*  This became their lives. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=127.0s)]
*  Shea Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, in the midst of all those harrowing threats and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=128.88s)]
*  intimidation, something else happened. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=134.04s)]
*  That tape, that 911 tape was from December 2020. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=138.88s)]
*  The following month in January 2021, actually two days before the January 6th attack, a [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=142.2s)]
*  woman showed up on Ruby Freeman's doorstep, said she had been sent by a high profile individual [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=148.68s)]
*  and she was there to help Ms. Freeman. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=153.48s)]
*  This woman told Ruby Freeman that she was in danger. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=156.76s)]
*  She told her that people were coming to her house in 48 hours and she was going to be [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=159.44s)]
*  locked up. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=163.56s)]
*  That woman who came to Ruby Freeman's house and made that apparent threat, it turned out [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=165.36s)]
*  in the end that she at least some point had been a publicist for the troubled Trump supporting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  hip hop artist Kanye West, which is the celebrity thing that got all the well this is weird [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  kind of headlines about this incident. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=180.28s)]
*  You might remember that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=183.4s)]
*  Where does that Kanye West publicist fit into all of this? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=184.36s)]
*  The way that actually resolved and what you should know ahead of Ms. Moss's testimony [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=187.8s)]
*  at tomorrow's hearing is that we hear on this show actually later determined that that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=192.16s)]
*  woman who showed up on Rudy Freeman's doorstep had been dispatched there by a Trump campaign [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=197.64s)]
*  operative. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=201.84s)]
*  When that woman came to Ruby Freeman's house, Ms. Freeman was so freaked out after a month [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=202.84s)]
*  of threats and harassment that while she said she was willing to talk with this person, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=206.84s)]
*  she said she would only agree to do so at the local police station. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  That was the only place she felt safe meeting this random stranger. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=216.16s)]
*  And so she went and met with her at the police station. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=219.36s)]
*  And because it was at the police station, part of their meeting was caught on a police [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=221.86s)]
*  body cam, which Reuters obtained. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  We didn't want to frighten you, but we had to find you within this time frame. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=228.28s)]
*  We've put in place a way to move you to secure you from what may be authorized over [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  the next 48 hours. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=235.62s)]
*  I can't say specifically what will take place. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=236.96s)]
*  I just know it will disrupt your freedom and the freedom of one or more members of your [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  family. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=243.12s)]
*  This is January 4th. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=245.12s)]
*  The woman then says she's going to put Ruby Freeman on the phone with somebody, quote, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=248.12s)]
*  very high level, with the authoritative powers to get you the protection that you need. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=251.32s)]
*  Protection from what? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=257.56s)]
*  Ruby Freeman told Reuters that once this other person, a man, got on the phone with her, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=259.92s)]
*  he and this woman who had come to her house to try to get her—to try to talk to her [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=264.14s)]
*  about moving her because something terrible was going to happen to her within 48 hours, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=268.8s)]
*  the man on the phone and that woman at the police station with her tried to get her to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=273.0s)]
*  admit to committing election fraud. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=276.48s)]
*  Ruby Freeman says the woman told her, quote, if you don't tell everything, you're going [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=279.28s)]
*  to jail. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=283.32s)]
*  Now, what's important about this, other than the bizarreness of it, is that the, quote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=284.32s)]
*  very high level guy who Ruby Freeman got put on the phone with, this person who could supposedly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=290.6s)]
*  get Ruby Freeman protection from what was otherwise going to happen to her if she just [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=294.86s)]
*  and otherwise she and a family member or more than one family member were all going to go [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=299.92s)]
*  to jail. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=303.76s)]
*  Turns out that guy worked for the Trump campaign. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=304.76s)]
*  He had been the paid executive director of a Trump campaign group called Black Voices [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=307.44s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=311.12s)]
*  He told us that he was the one who sent that woman to Ruby Freeman's house in January. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=312.16s)]
*  He claimed he was acting as a private citizen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=316.8s)]
*  When he did that, he said he was no longer on the Trump payroll. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  He also said that he personally never threatened Ms. Freeman. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=321.44s)]
*  He told Reuters he received calls from people offering Ruby Freeman immunity if she confessed [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=325.24s)]
*  to election fraud, but he wouldn't say who those people were or on what authority they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=330.98s)]
*  would have been able to offer her immunity. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=335.56s)]
*  And immunity from what? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=338.0s)]
*  What would she be prosecuted for? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=339.32s)]
*  She did not actually commit election fraud. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=340.8s)]
*  But again, this all happened on January 4th, and they keep giving her this deadline, right, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  by which she needs to act, she needs to confess, or she's going to get taken away, and maybe [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=349.64s)]
*  they can move her, maybe they can keep her safe. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=353.08s)]
*  Forty-eight hour deadline. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=355.56s)]
*  Well, what was happening 48 hours from January 4th? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  Why was it so important that they get her to confess to election fraud within 48 hours [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=359.8s)]
*  of January 4th? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=364.44s)]
*  Well, 48 hours later, of course, was January 6th, when Trump was planning to pressure Mike [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=365.88s)]
*  Pence into stopping the certification of Biden's election win. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=373.15999999999997s)]
*  And it would have, of course, been really handy to have a forced confession, a forced, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=377.64s)]
*  false confession of election fraud to point to that day as a reason to throw out the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=382.04s)]
*  Georgia results, or at least to delay certifying them because there was some great new controversy [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=386.16s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=390.68s)]
*  What exactly were they threatening Ruby Freeman with? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=394.96s)]
*  Well, as far as there being some threat to Ruby Freeman that would materialize 48 hours [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=397.44s)]
*  from January 4th, well, it did actually materialize. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=403.16s)]
*  According to a lawsuit Ms. Freeman filed against a right-wing website that promoted false stories [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=406.72s)]
*  about her, 48 hours after that visit from the Trump folks on January 6th, while pro-Trump [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=410.66s)]
*  rioters were storming the Capitol in Washington, a pro-Trump crowd also stormed her house, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=416.22s)]
*  surrounded Ruby Freeman's house outside Atlanta, shouting her through a bullhorn. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=422.7s)]
*  Fortunately, nobody was hurt. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=427.22s)]
*  She by then had already fled her home for her safety, following the FBI's advice to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=428.66s)]
*  do so. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=434.22s)]
*  And of course, Ruby Freeman, the 62-year-old election worker, grandmother from Atlanta, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=437.98s)]
*  did not confess to some invented charge of election fraud, right, despite this implied [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=443.3s)]
*  threat, this dangled promise from people connected to the Trump campaign that it would relieve [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=449.42s)]
*  the pressure on her and only then could they keep her safe. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=453.3s)]
*  The harassment and the threats turned Ruby Freeman's life upside down, turned her daughter [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=457.26s)]
*  Shea Moss' life upside down. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=461.58000000000004s)]
*  It has been a total nightmare for them, and they did nothing wrong. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=463.74s)]
*  But it is also still coming full circle. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=469.42s)]
*  Since then, the January 6th investigation has revealed not only that the claims about [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=473.76s)]
*  fraud in Fulton County were false, but that Trump was told in detail by the number two [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=478.3s)]
*  official at the U.S. Justice Department that the whole attack on that mother and daughter [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=483.58s)]
*  in Atlanta, the whole suitcases full of ballots claim, all these supposed fraud claims about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=487.88s)]
*  Fulton County, Georgia, were nonsense. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=491.94s)]
*  And we know that because we have tape from Richard Donahue, the number two official at [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=494.58s)]
*  the Justice Department after Bill Barr left. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=498.78s)]
*  We have tape of his deposition to the January 6th investigation. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  And I said something to the effect of, sir, we've done dozens of investigations, hundreds [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=506.5s)]

*  The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  We've looked at Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  We're doing our job. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=519.38s)]
*  And I said, sir, the information you're getting is false. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=521.86s)]
*  And I said, okay, well, with regard to Georgia, we looked at the tape, we interviewed the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=523.86s)]

*  There is no suitcase. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=529.82s)]
*  The president kept fixating on the suitcase that supposedly had fraudulent ballots and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=531.06s)]
*  that the suitcase was rolled out from under the table. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=535.5s)]
*  And I said, no, sir, there is no suitcase. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=539.02s)]
*  You can watch that video over and over. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=541.34s)]
*  There is no suitcase. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=543.1s)]
*  There is a wheeled bin where they carry the ballots. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=544.1s)]
*  And that's just how they move ballots around that facility. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=548.22s)]
*  There's nothing suspicious about that at all. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=550.4599999999999s)]
*  I told him that there was no multiple scanning of the ballots. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=556.4599999999999s)]
*  One of the, one part of that allegations that they were taking one ballot and scanning it [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=559.4599999999999s)]

*  I told him that the video did not support that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=569.62s)]
*  Pulled him flat out that much of the information he's getting is false and or just not supported [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=572.42s)]
*  by the evidence. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=578.18s)]
*  We look at the allegations, but they don't pan out. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=580.54s)]
*  The number two official at the Justice Department told President Trump personally and in detail [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=583.54s)]

*  Nothing you're saying about that is true. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=605.88s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shea Moss, did nothing wrong. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD_3hZgXphY&t=608.86s)]
