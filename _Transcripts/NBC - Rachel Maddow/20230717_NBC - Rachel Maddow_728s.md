# Republican attorneys general demand access to out-of-state abortion medical records
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo)
*  So it was just a week ago we covered Tennessee's Republican Attorney General [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=0.0s)]
*  Seizing the private medical records of trans people in that state [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=4.46s)]
*  Well, here's the lead in a breaking news story in the Tennessean newspaper tonight [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=7.9s)]
*  Tennessee's Attorney General wants the state to be able to investigate and compel information on out-of-state abortions [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=13.02s)]
*  These are your private medical records [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=23.26s)]
*  They are taking them already from trans people in Tennessee [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=26.42s)]
*  Now they want to take them from any Tennessee woman who has had an abortion in another state [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=30.54s)]
*  In another state. Yeah, if you live in Tennessee and you need to get an abortion [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=38.54s)]
*  Well Republicans have instituted an abortion ban in Tennessee. So you can't get one in Tennessee anymore [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  You will need to travel out of state but Tennessee's Republican Attorney General now says he intends to effectively [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=48.58s)]
*  Follow you out of state to get your medical records to see if you got an abortion somewhere else [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=54.68s)]
*  Even in the state where it's legal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=61.64s)]
*  That's the Tennessean tonight and oh look it's also in Kentucky [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=65.4s)]
*  Tonight in the Louisville Courier Journal the Kentucky Attorney General wants Kentucky ins out-of-state abortion records to be available to authorities [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=72.52s)]
*  Oh, it's not just Tennessee [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=81.12s)]
*  It's also Kentucky. Oh and look here it is in Arkansas too today in the Arkansas Times [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=83.96s)]
*  Arkansas Attorney General wants to know about your out-of-state abortion. It's happening with the Republican Attorney General in Arkansas, too [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Oh and look here tonight [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=97.6s)]
*  Here it is in Georgia [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Georgia Attorney General and here it is in Mississippi [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  Mississippi's Attorney General. This is from Mississippi Today a nonprofit news organization [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=106.83999999999999s)]
*  Which was actually first to break this story with this headline Mississippi's Attorney General wants to make info on out-of-state abortions available to Mississippi authorities [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=112.44s)]
*  Mississippi has banned abortion [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=121.32s)]
*  There is no abortion clinic left in Mississippi [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  So if you live in Mississippi and you need to get an abortion you will need to figure out how to get yourself out [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=126.52s)]
*  Of Mississippi and into a state where you can legally get one [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=131.72s)]
*  But the Republicans and state government in Mississippi say they will effectively follow you out of the state [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=135.34s)]
*  By virtue of the fact that you are a Mississippi resident [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=140.72s)]
*  Sorry, they now claim the right to seize your medical records from like a clinic in New York or in Illinois [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=144.04s)]
*  Or wherever else you go [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=151.48s)]
*  They claim the right to follow you there and take your private medical or records from there for their own law enforcement purposes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=153.24s)]
*  And I just showed you headlines from Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=161.24s)]
*  Arkansas, Georgia [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=166.52s)]
*  But it is actually 19 different states where Republican officials are going for this now [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=167.92s)]
*  19 Republican Attorney Generals in 19 states have signed on to a letter to the Biden administration [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=176.12s)]
*  Saying they want the right to go after women's private medical records anywhere in the country [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=183.2s)]
*  Including all the states where abortion is legal. They want to follow their residents all over the country [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=188.6s)]
*  to see [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=194.96s)]
*  If that woman might be getting an abortion or some other kind of reproductive care anywhere [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  They want the records and they claim the right to go get them [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=204.8s)]
*  Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=210.96s)]
*  Republican Attorneys General in all of those states have sent this letter to the Biden administration [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=216.24s)]
*  About their right as they see it to get your private medical records and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=222.0s)]
*  They mean it for women getting an abortion or potentially fertility treatment or any kind of reproductive care potentially contraception [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=228.24s)]
*  And yes, also gender affirming care of any kind [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=237.08s)]
*  They claim the right to go take your private medical records to see what you're up to with that kind of care [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  No matter where you have gone to get it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=246.68s)]
*  How can you get away from something like this? I mean if this is what they say they want to do and it is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=251.56s)]
*  How do you get away from it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=256.12s)]
*  The reason they've written to the Biden administration saying they claim this right is because the Biden administration [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=259.24s)]
*  Says they should not have the right to do this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  the Biden administration is trying to assert federally that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  Attorneys general from states where abortion is banned can't follow their residents to other state to see if they're getting banned care [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=272.76s)]
*  From someplace where it's legal [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  Beyond those those efforts to protect this at the federal level from the Biden administration [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=282.84s)]
*  You've also started to see blue states [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=287.4s)]
*  Places like New York and Washington state that have also passed state laws saying that nobody should be able to get private medical records [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=289.88s)]
*  Like this just because you've banned abortion in your state doesn't mean you can effectively enforce it in mine [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=297.0s)]
*  But here's 19 Republican states [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=303.24s)]
*  19 Republican state attorney general saying they're going for it and maybe they already are [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=306.12s)]
*  When reporter Joe Sanka from the Louisville Courier Journal today asked the Kentucky Attorney General's office if they have already pursued [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=311.88s)]
*  Private medical records from Kentucky women who've met ahead had medical treatment in other states [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=320.36s)]
*  The Attorney General's office didn't give Joe Sanka an answer [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  He says he has still not heard back from the Attorney General's office about this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=327.92s)]
*  Which leaves open the possibility that maybe they are already doing this maybe they are already trying or getting these medical records [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  They used to say that the Republican Party was the party of limited government [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  This is a lot of things but this is not that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=347.64s)]
*  Joining us now is Minnie Timuraju. She's president of Neyral pro-choice America. Ms. Timuraju. It's really great to see you [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=351.88s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. Thanks for having me [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=357.56s)]
*  So I want to start with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=361.32s)]
*  This letter from these 19 Republican attorneys general they're writing writing to the Biden administration [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=364.04s)]
*  Why why have they said that why have they taken this on as a matter that they need to take up with the federal government? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  You know the Republican AG's have been [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=379.2s)]
*  Increasingly extremists. They're some of the most egregious [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  Offenders of attacks of our fundamental freedoms from right from the freedom to vote to reproductive freedom [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=385.28s)]
*  It's not shocking that as they're losing the public opinion war on abortion [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=390.28s)]
*  They're pivoting and trying to conflate a gender-affirming care attacks with abortion care [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=395.36s)]
*  You know, we know that the opponents for reproductive freedom and abortion access are the same as the opponents of gender-affirming care and the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  LGBTQ plus and trans communities we know this because we know where the dark money is coming from [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=408.8s)]
*  We know who the organizers are behind this there's model legislation [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=413.92s)]
*  This all kind of started with SB 8 in Texas actually my home state which established this vigilante [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=418.6s)]
*  Mechanism right and really encouraged citizens of the state to spy and report [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=424.96s)]
*  Texans who left the state to have abortions and when you have organized entities with extremist [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=430.64s)]
*  Organizations like you know Heritage Society Christian [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=437.44s)]
*  Right to life they are literally disseminating model legislation and tactics within the AG's and between the legislature [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=441.17999999999995s)]
*  So it's not shocking our sense of this is they're losing the public opinion war on abortion [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=448.38s)]
*  They are desperate to win back [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=455.94s)]
*  Win back power and in Mississippi, we know we have folks [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=458.73999999999995s)]
*  The AG is currently up for reelection and she's gonna be in a tough race. So this is them fear-mongering [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=463.38s)]
*  against some of the most vulnerable Americans to try to score points and they're increasingly [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=468.9s)]
*  desperate base [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=475.78s)]
*  So we started covering this story when we learned about it in Tennessee when families in Tennessee got notified by Vanderbilt University Medical Center that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=478.02s)]
*  Sort of much to their chagrin the Medical Center felt compelled to hand over people's medical records when the Attorney General demanded them [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=486.7s)]
*  Families didn't find out that the medical records had actually gone to the AG's office until months after they'd already been handed over which I think was very [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=494.86s)]
*  Distressing to a lot of these families, but it raises very practical questions immediately one is what can medical providers [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=501.62s)]
*  Do to protect the privacy of their patients both in Republican controlled states where there may be bans on the kinds of health care that we're talking about here [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  But also in blue states where these things are legal and people should be able to obtain this kind of medical care without sort of without government intrusion [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=520.42s)]
*  But what can people themselves do to try to protect themselves if attorneys general in all of these states? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=528.42s)]
*  I mean 19 states are saying they think that people's private medical information like this is fair game [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=533.54s)]
*  So I think you alluded to it before the Biden administration HHS [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=539.46s)]
*  Proposed this rule in response to an active, you know public comment period but also [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=543.38s)]
*  The White House led by Vice President Harris and the Gender Policy Council has done 40 plus meetings with abortion providers activists patients [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=551.2199999999999s)]
*  In tough states like Idaho and Missouri. They've been soliciting feedback from legislators AG's [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=560.26s)]
*  They've known for a long time that this is what states were trying to do the report [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=566.26s)]
*  The reporting you gave they've been tracking this which is also why state the US Senate last year Catherine Cortez Masto led by Catherine Cortez Masto [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  Also tried to pass legislation that would protect providers and patients from crossing state lines [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=578.4200000000001s)]
*  Now what can folks do in the states where these AG's are threatening their bodily autonomy and their freedom? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=583.46s)]
*  They have to frankly the best choice is to fight back at the ballot box [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  We have to get more action on the basis of the state's ability to protect their patients [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=594.1800000000001s)]
*  And we have to be more proactive about removing extremist AG's [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=600.34s)]
*  You know some of the most forward thinking attorneys general are now the governors in states that are doing the most advanced work on reproductive care [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=603.38s)]
*  You're talking about you're going to have Governor Shapiro on he's a former AG [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=613.38s)]
*  Maura Healey former AG I hate to make it political but it is political [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=616.9s)]
*  We have to organize reproductive freedom voters to your point earlier in the show Rachel [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=621.22s)]
*  Reproductive freedom voters have to become supporters of the broad range of freedoms for everybody for our LGBTQ brothers and sisters [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=626.0200000000001s)]
*  The other course of action folks can take is to challenge these bills and these laws in the courts [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=634.98s)]
*  And a lot of our colleagues at ACLU, the Center for Reproductive Rights are working on litigation [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=641.3800000000001s)]
*  Manny Temeraju is president of NARAL Pro-Choice America [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRzz6lYStgo&t=648.6600000000001s)]
