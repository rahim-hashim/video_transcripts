# Watch Rachel Maddow highlights: Feb. 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w)
*  If you were looking for a succinct summation of the state of one of the two major American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=0.0s)]
*  political parties right now, you could do worse than the opening line of this Washington [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=4.74s)]
*  Post report from this weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  Dateline Lansing, Michigan, quote, Republicans here, reeling from a midterm election route [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=10.58s)]
*  that many blamed on the influence of former President Donald Trump, responded Saturday [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  by spurning Trump's choice for state party chair and choosing someone even more extreme. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=20.76s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=28.66s)]
*  After a chaotic party convention this weekend, yes, the Michigan Republican Party has elected [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=30.62s)]
*  as their new chair a woman whose relevant experience is having just lost a statewide [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=35.2s)]
*  election for secretary of state by a whopping 14 points. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=39.9s)]
*  She describes herself as a Christian nationalist. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=44.34s)]
*  People who are Christian nationalists believe that only Christians should be citizens. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  She believes that demonic possession is not only real but contagious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=53.04s)]
*  And the core of her pitch to become chair of the Michigan State Republican Party was [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=57.86s)]
*  that she believes the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump, but the 2020 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=61.74s)]
*  election was also stolen from her as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=67.38s)]
*  Her opponent in the race for state party chairman, he also lost a race for statewide office in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=71.14s)]
*  Michigan last year, but his unforgivable sin after he lost that race was that he conceded [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=77.18s)]
*  that he lost. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=84.3s)]
*  She never conceded that she lost. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=85.98s)]
*  She still denies that she lost, and so they picked her over him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=88.5s)]
*  Because the more election denial, the better. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=93.22s)]
*  If there was any question as to whether or not there was any lessening of election denying [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  radicalism in the Republican Party, it would seem that actually the opposite is true. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  At least in Michigan, but it's not like Michigan is an outlier here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=106.5s)]
*  Take for example the state of Georgia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=109.22s)]
*  We've now learned that in Georgia, their state Republican Party is paying the legal [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=110.94s)]
*  bills of most of their fake electors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=115.32s)]
*  These are the people who are facing potential criminal prosecution now for having signed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=118.7s)]
*  forged documents that were then sent to Congress in the National Archives, forged documents [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=122.78s)]
*  claiming that Trump won their state even though Trump didn't win their state. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=129.42s)]
*  The state party is apparently behind them all the way for having done that, and we now [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=133.1s)]
*  know, thanks to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, that the state party has already paid out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=137.58s)]
*  over $200,000 for their legal bills. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=141.66000000000003s)]
*  Perhaps that's because one of the fake electors is the state party chairman of the Republican [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  Party in Georgia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  But there's one other of these that I think goes with it in Washington, and it concerns [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=157.94s)]
*  Today Axios was first to report that Speaker McCarthy has decided to hand over all the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=160.58s)]
*  Capitol security camera footage from the January 6th attack. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=166.34s)]
*  This is 41,000 hours of footage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  He's handed it all over to the Fox News Channel, which has devoted hours and hours and hours [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  of airtime to conspiracy theories about January 6th being a liberal deep state plot that only [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=178.22s)]
*  seemed like it was caused by Trump supporters, but really it was the liberals. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=183.98s)]
*  So the Speaker of the House just gave them all the security camera footage from the actual [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=189.48s)]
*  Capitol for them to play with, to see what they can do. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=194.18s)]
*  Here you go, Fox News primetime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  Hopefully you can use this official government material to concoct an alternate narrative [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=200.74s)]
*  to give us a more convenient revisionist history about what happened on January 6th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  These things all have one thing in common. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=212.82s)]
*  As time goes by, the Republican Party's devotion to the stolen election lie, the Republican [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=215.3s)]
*  Party's devotion to denying the results of elections they don't like, the Republican [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=220.54s)]
*  Party's devotion to rewriting their history of their attempts to overturn previous elections. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  That fever is not breaking. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=232.06s)]
*  This problem they've got is not diminishing over time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=234.42s)]
*  It is not getting better as time goes on. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=237.0s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=239.66s)]
*  Now with Ukraine having held off Russia for a year, I think it's fair to say that the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=242.2s)]
*  dominant expectation is that a long grinding war in the long run benefits Russia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=247.34s)]
*  However, inspiring and resilient the Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=254.34s)]
*  Ultimately, Russia is a much bigger country and per capita it's paying a much lower cost [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=258.86s)]
*  for this war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=263.3s)]
*  And so in that formulation, time is on Russia's side. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=264.58s)]
*  The longer the war grinds on, the more likely it is that Russia comes out the ultimate victor. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=267.66s)]
*  Now not everyone holds that view, of course, but I think it's fairly, I think it's fair [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=272.62s)]
*  to say that it's a widely held Western expectation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=277.06s)]
*  Given how badly widely held Western expectations have fared over the course of this past year [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=282.09999999999997s)]
*  when it comes to this war, I think perhaps it's worth looking at that one too. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=288.02s)]
*  On the occasion of President Biden's surprise trip to Kiev today to meet with President [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=293.9s)]
*  Zelensky in Ukraine, Anne Applebaum argues in The Atlantic that actually in this case, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=298.98s)]
*  even if what President Biden's trip to Kiev says is that time isn't on Russia's side, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=305.66s)]
*  time is on Ukraine's side. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=311.22s)]
*  And that's a message that everybody, including Russia, should now get. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=313.74s)]
*  How could that be? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=318.22s)]
*  Joining us now is Anne Applebaum. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=319.5s)]
*  She's a Pulitzer Prize winner, staff writer at The Atlantic. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  Ms. Applebaum, thank you so much for being here. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=323.66s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=325.3s)]
*  Delighted. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=328.3s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if that, if you agree with that framing that there have been [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=330.3s)]
*  some big Western expectations about how this last year would go that have been wrong, proved [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=333.34s)]
*  wrong at a pretty fundamental level. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=340.94s)]
*  Look, we got almost everything about this war wrong. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=343.94s)]
*  A year ago today, most people expected the capital in Kiev to fall within a few days. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  They thought Zelensky would flee the country, the president of Ukraine. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=355.9s)]
*  If he wasn't going to flee the country, they thought he would be almost certainly assassinated [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=360.1s)]
*  or would be very quickly arrested or eliminated. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=363.48s)]
*  There were lists circulating of Ukrainians who were due to be arrested. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=371.16s)]
*  We were very wrong both about the Russian military and about the Ukrainians. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=372.98s)]
*  We didn't factor in the corruption of Russia. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=378.6s)]
*  When we heard how much money had been spent on the Russian military, we thought it had [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=382.74s)]
*  gone to buying weapons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=385.72s)]
*  It turned out that quite a lot of it had gone to buy villas in the south of France or apartments [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=387.44s)]
*  in London. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=391.64s)]
*  I think we missed the story of Ukraine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=393.12s)]
*  We missed the reconstruction of Ukraine that took place after 2014. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=395.32s)]
*  We missed the resurgence of Ukrainian civil society. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=399.08s)]
*  It's a society that's really built from the ground up and not the top down. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=402.24s)]
*  A lot of young people run it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=407.86s)]
*  You see many ministers and deputy ministers who are in their 30s and 40s. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=410.44s)]
*  They really replaced the generation of post-Soviet leaders who led the country up until eight [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=414.52s)]
*  or nine years ago. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=421.35999999999996s)]
*  We misread how the war was going to go. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=424.24s)]
*  I think it's worth continually asking ourselves whether we're not misreading what's going [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  to happen in the next few months or the next couple of years as well. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  I think your framing in that sense is absolutely right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=434.96s)]
*  All of those mistakes or false assumptions or things that have been proven wrong all [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  sort of go in one direction. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=444.56s)]
*  They all lend to us overestimating Russia's capabilities and underestimating Ukraine's. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=446.56s)]
*  Is it possible now after a year that we're in danger of overcorrecting for that and overestimating [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=451.76s)]
*  what Ukraine can withstand, underestimating what Russia, particularly the Russian military, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=457.38s)]
*  is capable of? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=463.76s)]
*  The Russian military, most people who are watching it don't think that the Russian [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=468.12s)]
*  military is capable of anything extraordinary and credible. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=471.36s)]
*  They're not capable of any great breakthroughs. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=474.52s)]
*  They have a lot of people whom they're willing to sacrifice. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=477.88s)]
*  They've proved that they're willing to tolerate really an extraordinary number of casualties [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  that unimaginable, for example, in the United States, that we could have up to 200,000 casualties [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=485.64s)]
*  and that there would be no public outcry or no objection, especially in a war that most [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=490.46s)]
*  people aren't interested in or don't feel strongly about or even really are afraid to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=496.04s)]
*  discuss. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  So of course, I don't want to indicate that Russia is to be somehow discounted or ignored. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=504.6s)]
*  As you've said earlier in the program, President Putin is going to make a speech tomorrow, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=511.44s)]
*  which may well call for a new mobilization. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=515.88s)]
*  He might call for the move to a war economy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=518.64s)]
*  He might close the borders. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  All kinds of things are possible. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=522.36s)]
*  But I also think we should keep in mind the Ukrainians have been working very hard to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=524.32s)]
*  think about new and different ways to fight. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=529.36s)]
*  They are good at reinventing weapons, changing the way they work, you know, whether it's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=533.12s)]
*  cheap drones or more expensive American equipment. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=539.32s)]
*  They sometimes have made it work in new ways. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=544.38s)]
*  They use it in unusual ways. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=546.6400000000001s)]
*  I know that they're thinking hard about what advantages they can have against, you know, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=548.72s)]
*  against a large military Russian force. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=554.28s)]
*  And I think it's important not to underestimate them again either. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=556.84s)]
*  You know, it's also a war in which I think we have to take into consideration the possibility [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=561.24s)]
*  of black swan events. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=565.62s)]
*  We don't really know what's going on inside the Kremlin. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=568.64s)]
*  We don't have any way of finding out. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=571.02s)]
*  Many things could change very quickly. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=573.76s)]
*  Public support for the war in Russia could crumble very quickly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=576.56s)]
*  Public support in the sense of the small number of people around Putin could change rapidly [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=580.3s)]
*  once it becomes clear that the war can't be won. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=586.3599999999999s)]
*  So there are lots of strange and unexpected factors that I'd hate to sit here and make [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=588.92s)]
*  bad predictions one year into the war when, as I said a year ago, people got almost everything [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=596.7199999999999s)]
*  wrong. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=601.68s)]
*  But as you say, I think it's wise to say watch out for the unexpected. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=603.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that actually includes watching out for what we're going to hear tomorrow [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=609.28s)]
*  from President Putin in his sort of state of the state speech. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=612.4s)]
*  Those potential previews that you gave there in terms of what people will be looking for, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=616.8399999999999s)]
*  moving to a wartime economy, potentially closing the borders, other extreme measures like that, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=620.64s)]
*  could put things on a very different footing for him domestically. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=626.5999999999999s)]
*  It'll be really interesting to watch. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=628.8s)]
*  Anne Applebaum, staff writer at The Atlantic. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=631.12s)]
*  I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=632.76s)]
*  I know you've been traveling a lot recently, and this is late at night. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=634.32s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=637.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dRZ5gwT7w&t=640.4s)]
