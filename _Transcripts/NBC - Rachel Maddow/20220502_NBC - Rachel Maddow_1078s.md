# Politico Reporter On Obtaining Leaked SCOTUS Draft Opinion Overturning Roe V. Wade
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c)
*  The headline at politico.com right now, just breaking in the last few minutes, is this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=0.0s)]
*  The United States Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights. Draft opinion shows. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  According to an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=10.8s)]
*  circulated inside the court and obtained by Politico, the Supreme Court has voted to strike [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=15.44s)]
*  down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The draft opinion is a full-throated, unflinching [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  repudiation of the 1973 decision, which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=25.2s)]
*  rights and also a subsequent 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which largely [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=30.56s)]
*  maintained the right. Alito writes in this draft majority opinion, quote, Roe was egregiously wrong [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=35.6s)]
*  from the start. We hold that Roe and Casey must be overturned. It is time to heed the constitution [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=42.08s)]
*  and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives, which, as Chris was just [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=48.72s)]
*  mentioning there, means returning it to the states. And in more than two dozen states, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=53.68s)]
*  there are what are called trigger laws, which would immediately render abortion a crime, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=58.64s)]
*  render it illegal immediately upon the Supreme Court issuing such a ruling. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=63.36s)]
*  As Josh Gerstein reports, along with his colleague Alexander Ward at Politico tonight, quote, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=69.28s)]
*  the immediate impact of the ruling would be to end a half century guarantee of federal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=73.44s)]
*  constitutional protection of abortion rights. It would allow each state to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=77.84s)]
*  decide whether to restrict or ban abortion. It is unclear if there have been subsequent [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=81.2s)]
*  changes to the draft. This draft ruling that has been obtained and published by Politico tonight [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=85.36s)]
*  was reportedly drafted in February. Politico received a copy of the draft opinion, quote, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=90.8s)]
*  from a person familiar with the court's proceedings in the Mississippi case, the abortion case, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=96.08s)]
*  along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document. The draft opinion runs [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=101.12s)]
*  98 pages. The document is replete with citations to previous court decisions, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=105.92s)]
*  books and authorities and includes 118 footnotes. The appearances and timing of this draft [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=109.68s)]
*  are consistent with court practice. The disclosure of Alito's draft majority opinion is a rare [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  breach of Supreme Court secrecy and tradition around its deliberations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=120.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Josh Gerstein. He's the senior legal affairs reporter for Politico. He's one of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=125.76s)]
*  the best legal reporters and legal political explainers in the country. He broke this story [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=130.0s)]
*  tonight along with his colleague Alexander Ward. Josh, thank you for coming on tonight on such [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  short notice. I realize that you didn't know four minutes ago that you were going to be on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=139.52s)]
*  TV talking about this with me tonight. No problem, Rachel. Happy to join you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=142.72s)]
*  I'm not going to press you, of course, on your sourcing here, but I want to press you on your [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  confidence in your sourcing. Obviously, this is a very unusual, if not completely historically [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=152.72s)]
*  unprecedented leak, a document that purports to be the draft majority opinion of the Supreme Court [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=158.96s)]
*  before they have issued any such ruling. Can you just tell us about your confidence [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=166.08s)]
*  in the authenticity of the document? Well, we're very confident in the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  authenticity of this draft majority opinion, Rachel, both in the way that we obtained it [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  and other information that we got that supports its authenticity and makes us believe that it is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=182.4s)]
*  genuine. Now, of course, it's not a final opinion. It's a draft opinion. It was circulated in the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  court as a first draft by Justice Alito in February, dated February 10th. So it is possible [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=194.0s)]
*  there have been some changes since then. But it's our best understanding of at least where the court [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=200.8s)]
*  stood at that time, which is about two and a half months after arguments in this pivotal Mississippi [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=206.4s)]
*  abortion case. And you report, Josh, and again, forgive me if I get any of these details wrong. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=212.16s)]
*  I am learning this as I'm talking about it, which is always dangerous. But you report that the court [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=218.72s)]
*  majority here is established, that there are at least in the initial conference between the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  justices after the arguments, there were five votes on Justice Alito's reported side here. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=230.0s)]
*  And the only ambiguity, the only question is whether or not Justice Roberts would make it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=236.0s)]
*  a 6-3 decision or a 5-4 decision if he chose to side with the more liberal members of the court. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any, what can you tell us about your reporting in terms of the numbers here, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=247.2s)]
*  in terms of how the two sides align and whether that may still be a matter with some fluidity? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's our understanding from a person familiar with the proceedings that Justice [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=258.08s)]
*  Alito believes and that the court has five justices that are essentially aligned with this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  opinion that he's written, which is just a withering takedown of the Roe v. Wade precedent. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=270.64s)]
*  It pulls no punches at all. It's pretty brutal. And in the way it's structured, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=278.64s)]
*  it kind of needs to be that way because of the way Alito confronts this issue of a court precedent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=283.36s)]
*  Starry decisis is the legal term. And something has to be really, really wrong if they want to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=289.76s)]
*  overturn it. And that's the case that Justice Alito makes here. There is still some ambiguity [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=295.36s)]
*  about where Chief Justice John Roberts stands, as many people noted at the oral arguments at [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  the beginning of December. It sounded like he was finding a way maybe to approve this Mississippi [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=307.6s)]
*  law, which is a 15-week abortion ban, without completely ripping down the Roe v. Wade precedent. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=312.56s)]
*  Our understanding is that most of his Republican colleagues want to go ahead and take down [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=319.44s)]
*  Roe v. Wade. Now, that said, we're at the beginning of May here, and this final decision [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=325.2s)]
*  likely won't be published until the end of June, perhaps even the beginning of July. So it's fair [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=330.96s)]
*  to say that this is a situation that is unresolved at this point. And I can't promise you that various [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=336.8s)]
*  things may not change between now and late June. Josh, in terms of the substance of this opinion [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  as written, again, this draft majority opinion, and with the caveat that this is a historically [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=350.8s)]
*  unprecedented leak of what appears to be a draft majority opinion from the court before any ruling [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=356.48s)]
*  is issued, with the caveat that you just described in terms of whether or not this may go through [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=361.04s)]
*  additional changes, even potentially substantial changes, before we see the ruling from the court [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=364.72s)]
*  as published later this year, with all those caveats intact, when you look at what Justice Alito wrote [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=369.12s)]
*  here. How does this comport with expectations in this case? Obviously, as you were just describing, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=374.88s)]
*  the leanings of the justices on this matter, I think, to realist-minded observers were clear [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=382.4s)]
*  even before oral arguments and certainly were clear thereafter. But I think it was also [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=389.68s)]
*  perhaps still common wisdom that the justices would try to soft-pedal this a little bit, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=394.48s)]
*  that they would try to undermine Roe and effectively remove the protections of Roe [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=398.96s)]
*  without a sort of 21-gun salute, which is what this appears to be, at least in terms of the way [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=404.16s)]
*  that you've been able to describe Justice Alito's thinking. Is that a fair assessment of this, that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  this is more of a bludgeon when it was perhaps expected to be something more of a more subtle [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=415.92s)]
*  approach? It's definitely a swing-for-the-fences draft majority opinion. He's really holding nothing [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=423.68s)]
*  back here, Justice Alito. And I know what the conventional wisdom was, Rachel, that maybe [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=431.68s)]
*  the court would try to soften the blow. But at those arguments, there was precious little [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=439.04s)]
*  indication of that from any of the Republican-appointed justices other really than Chief [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=443.68s)]
*  Justice Roberts. And another reason to think that this may have full support from all the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=449.68s)]
*  Republican-appointed justices except the chief is if you go through the opinion, you'll find [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=455.6s)]
*  echoes in there of views that other members of the court have stated on previous occasions. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=461.04s)]
*  There are parts of this opinion that sound a lot like Justice Clarence Thomas. When you read through [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  it, you'll see on a few occasions the word abortionist appears in this opinion. That's a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=471.76s)]
*  word that Justice Thomas has taken to using in recent years and that most of the other [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=477.12s)]
*  members of the court don't typically use. And there's another passage that seems to cater [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=481.76s)]
*  to some comments that Justice Amy Coney Barrett made at the oral arguments about the way views on [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=486.8s)]
*  sort of unwed pregnancy out of wedlock births and women's rights have evolved since the Roe v. Wade [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  was handed down in 1973. So it really does seem that Alito is trying to cobble together a majority. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=501.44s)]
*  People can also look at it and see how much do you think it does to address the concerns Chief [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=508.88s)]
*  Justice Roberts has raised about the credibility of the court and the concern about public opinion. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=513.6s)]
*  I think there's portions in it that don't seem to give full weight to the chief's concerns, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=520.32s)]
*  which also supports the notion that maybe he's not expecting to be part of this opinion. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=525.76s)]
*  Josh, in terms of the likely impact of a ruling, if it does in its final form look like what you [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=532.48s)]
*  have reported and published tonight, if we had a Republican controlled [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=537.92s)]
*  House and a Republican controlled Senate and a Republican in the White House, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=544.8s)]
*  is there any line in this ruling, as you read it, that would prevent the legislature and the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=549.92s)]
*  president from establishing a new law that full-on banned abortion in its entirety in every state in [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=557.92s)]
*  the country in every instance? Well, it's a draft decision and it doesn't really get into the issue [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=564.64s)]
*  of what the federal government's power, I think, would be in this area. So I think it certainly [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=572.56s)]
*  leaves that open as a possibility. There might be other obstacles to that, like [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=577.92s)]
*  the legislative filibuster we still have, at least for the time being, in the United States Senate. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=582.64s)]
*  But, you know, there are points at which Alito tries to suggest that, you know, this won't [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=588.72s)]
*  bring all the scenery down. If we move away from abortion to other privacy-based rights, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=594.0s)]
*  such as contraception, rights like gay marriage, he does try to ring-fence this opinion and say, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=600.08s)]
*  all we're talking about is abortion. He mentions that several times and he suggests that it [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=606.4s)]
*  shouldn't be stretched into other areas. That said, I'm old enough to know that the court many times [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=611.52s)]
*  has said, don't try to apply our opinion on X to this situation Y because it's different, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=616.72s)]
*  and yet it often does get applied that way. But there's no question he's trying to keep this [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=622.32s)]
*  confined to the issue of abortion. And, of course, that's telling it itself, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=627.36s)]
*  right? To be able to say, to be willing to say, like, oh, this is just about abortion, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=635.7600000000001s)]
*  it's not about anything important, don't worry. It tells you a lot about the frame of mind behind [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=638.88s)]
*  people who would make this kind of a change. Let me just ask you about one last piece of this, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=647.76s)]
*  Josh. Since we've been on the air, since we received your reporting tonight, since you published, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=652.48s)]
*  we on my show have contacted four former clerks for Supreme Court justices, all of whom uniformly [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=657.92s)]
*  told us that the document that you have published tonight appears to be a legitimate work product of [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=665.84s)]
*  the court, meaning it just matches in form and style and texture the kind of product that they, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=670.88s)]
*  as clerks, were used to seeing as a draft majority opinion. That highlights in itself, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=675.68s)]
*  I think, the unique nature of this reporting that you have done and this leak. And I wonder if you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  have any reflection on what it might mean for the credibility of the court, for the legitimacy of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=689.92s)]
*  the court, for a draft majority opinion to have made its way into your hands. This is something [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=696.64s)]
*  that has never happened before in the history of the court. And as a court observer and somebody [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=704.4s)]
*  who understands how the court fits into our politics, what sort of impact do you think [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=708.48s)]
*  this will have on the court itself? Well, I mean, there have been leaks out of the court before, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=712.48s)]
*  perhaps not of this magnitude, but we've all gotten kind of used to on these big decisions, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=719.28s)]
*  such as Obamacare, such as this abortion decision, to hints, body English, I might call it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=724.72s)]
*  There's a nuanced reading of editorials that appear in different places, places like the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=733.52s)]
*  Wall Street Journal editorial page, where you can often see indications that maybe the court [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=739.12s)]
*  is moving one way and conservatives aren't happy about it. You do see that kind of dialogue, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  but never accompanied by an actual opinion. So I do think that this is ground-breaking and it does [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=752.16s)]
*  take the court into new territory. It would certainly be very interesting to know what [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=759.6s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts thinks about this, even if he doesn't agree with this opinion. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=764.96s)]
*  What does he think about whether this causes the court to be viewed as a political institution [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=770.4s)]
*  by some people? That's what we're going to have to see how it plays out over the next couple of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=776.16s)]
*  months as this continues to resonate towards the final decision at the end of June. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=781.52s)]
*  All right. And the importance of Chief Justice Roberts' opinion on matters like that is not [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=788.08s)]
*  just what he thinks as a person and how it affects him personally. It's that the court is effectively [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=792.6400000000001s)]
*  a self-regulating body that sets its own ethics and standards. And if this is going to—if this [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=797.12s)]
*  is going to sort of shake the foundations of the court and its perception and its role in politics, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=805.12s)]
*  his opinion will be more important than anybody else's by a considerable margin. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=810.88s)]
*  Josh Gerstein, Senior Legal Affairs Reporter for Politico, you will always, in your entire life, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=815.76s)]
*  be the reporter who broke this story, whatever else happens in your life and everything else [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=819.92s)]
*  that you've done in the past. I know this is a really big deal, and I really appreciate [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=824.4799999999999s)]
*  you being here tonight with us. Thank you. Thanks so much, Rachel. Take care. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  All right. I will just mention—let me just restate what it is that we are talking about here. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  Josh Gerstein, the reporter you just saw for Politico, along with his colleague Alexander [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=837.68s)]
*  Ward, has just broken this story, this remarkable story at Politico.com. Supreme Court has voted [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=840.96s)]
*  to overturn abortion rights. Draft opinion shows—the fact that a draft opinion from [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=847.44s)]
*  the United States Supreme Court is in front of us is itself, as far as we know, an unprecedented [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=852.72s)]
*  thing. There have been leaks in the past, as Josh just mentioned, about what's happened during [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=858.24s)]
*  discussions among the justices about what may or may not have gone down in the room behind where [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=864.64s)]
*  the justices sit on the dais we're all so familiar with from court sketches when they sit down in [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  conference to discuss what happens. We have had descriptions of those discussions in the past. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=876.8s)]
*  We have never, as far as I know, had a written, in this case, 90-plus page draft majority opinion [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=880.4s)]
*  released to the public through a reporter before a ruling was actually issued. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  We don't know anything about who the source is. Josh, you just heard him speak in his own words [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=891.84s)]
*  about why he and his colleagues and his editors are confident in the sourcing of this matter. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  It's obviously an earthquake for all these substantive reasons. I will tell you, just as a [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=901.52s)]
*  matter in terms of our confidence in the story, we've spoken with a number, four different [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=904.96s)]
*  Supreme Court—former Supreme Court clerks just in the last few minutes who all say that they agree [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=911.76s)]
*  with Josh and his colleagues at Politico that this looks like a work product from the court, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=916.64s)]
*  whether or not it has been or will be revised before it's ultimately published. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=921.12s)]
*  The bottom line here is that this is—this would appear to be the day that—I mean, I was born in [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=925.36s)]
*  1973, which is the year that Roe v. Wade was passed. In my entire sentient life, women have [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  been talking about the day that this would come and that Roe v. Wade would be overturned and that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=939.36s)]
*  the United States would become a country in which abortion was treated as a crime and it was the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=944.96s)]
*  government. It was the state that is allowed to decide whether or not women give birth. It's the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=949.76s)]
*  state that is allowed to force women to bring unwanted pregnancies to term, even if they, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=956.3199999999999s)]
*  for the world's most—greatest or lightest reasons, don't want to do it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=962.4s)]
*  Putting the government in control of women's lives in this way changes something fundamental [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=967.76s)]
*  about who we are as a country, who we are as a culture, and who we are as men and women. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=974.72s)]
*  And if this change is coming not as a sort of feathered-in set of reforms designed to ultimately [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=980.72s)]
*  undermine the right or make it less available, like we have seen even over the course of this year as [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=987.92s)]
*  Republican-controlled states have been advancing these newly aggressive policies and the court's [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=991.68s)]
*  been letting them do it, but if instead they're just knocking it out and abortion is going to be [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=996.24s)]
*  illegal in every state, that will make that happen on their own terms or, as The Washington Post [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1001.4399999999999s)]
*  reported just this morning with this headline, the next frontier for the abortion—anti-abortion [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1006.96s)]
*  movement, a nationwide ban. The Washington Post literally reported this morning that leading [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1012.32s)]
*  anti-abortion groups and their allies in Congress have been meeting behind the scenes to plan a [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  national strategy that would kick in if the Supreme Court rules back abortion rights this summer, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1020.48s)]
*  including a push for a strict nationwide ban on abortion if Republicans retake power in Washington. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1024.48s)]
*  That was the news this morning. They are working on a nationwide abortion ban to make it a crime. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1031.2s)]
*  Coast to coast, everywhere in the country, as soon as they've got power. As Chris Hayes just [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1036.72s)]
*  noted a moment ago, it would be H.R. 1 or Senate Bill 1 if Republicans, in fact, get back in power. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1040.32s)]
*  But to have that paired tonight with this draft opinion saying that the Supreme Court is about [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1045.28s)]
*  to clear the way just for that means that we are on the precipice of becoming a very different [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1049.76s)]
*  country and our daughters and granddaughters living in a very, very different world. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1053.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIYxT7Fe60c&t=1066.72s)]
