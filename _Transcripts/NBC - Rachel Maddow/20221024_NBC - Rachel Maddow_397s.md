# Voting Rights Groups Turn To Courts To Fight Ballot Box Vigilantes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0)
*  Managing an election is not supposed to be a scary thing in our country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=0.0s)]
*  Neither is voting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=4.4s)]
*  But we are seeing the news out of Arizona these days. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=6.2s)]
*  One voter in Mesa, Arizona, last week reported being filmed while approaching a drop box [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  to drop off his ballot, which is a lawful thing to do. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  As of Friday in Arizona, they're apparently now showing up armed and in tactical gear at voting sites. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=18.04s)]
*  You can see them sort of more closely here in this footage, which I believe we have. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=23.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=28.8s)]
*  This is at a voting site? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=30.28s)]
*  If you are alarmed by these kinds of images, if you think this doesn't sound right, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=33.52s)]
*  if you think this maybe doesn't even sound lawful, you are not alone. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=36.92s)]
*  As I mentioned at the top of the show, a new lawsuit was just filed tonight in federal court in Arizona, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  asking the court to step in and stop this from happening right away, at least in that state. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=44.8s)]
*  Quote, absent declaratory and injunctive relief, voters will be subjected to intimidation, threats [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  and perhaps even force or physical harm at the hands of vigilante drop box watchers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=55.84s)]
*  And many may suffer unwarranted delays or denials of their right to cast a ballot in the approaching elections. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Again, this lawsuit just filed tonight, federal court in Arizona. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=68.08s)]
*  Joining us now is Mark Elias, election lawyer, founder of Democracy Docket, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=70.44s)]
*  which filed that voter intimidation lawsuit tonight in Arizona on behalf of two local organizations. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=74.44s)]
*  Mr. Elias, it's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. Thanks for being here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=79.76s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=83.12s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about the basis for this lawsuit and who your organization is representing in bringing it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=84.36s)]
*  Sure. So our organization is representing two really great pro voting groups, the Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=94.36s)]
*  And the basic facts of the complaint are simple, which is that we now have vigilantes, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=105.68s)]
*  some of whom are armed, intimidating voters from casting their ballots in a legal way. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=112.44s)]
*  That is via drop box. The law is very clear. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=118.0s)]
*  There are actually two sets of laws, one that go back to the days of the Klu Klux Klan in the 19th century, the Klu Klux Klan Act, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=122.16s)]
*  the other more recent, the Voting Rights Act that specifically prevent this type of intimidation at the poll. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=130.56s)]
*  How late is too late for this kind of an intervention? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=138.36s)]
*  We're 15 days out from the election. Obviously, you're asking for immediate relief from the courts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=141.44s)]
*  Do you believe the courts can act quickly enough? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=147.16s)]
*  The courts can be sort of nimble enough to intervene in a way that will protect voting rights in enough time to make a difference? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=149.72s)]
*  I do. In fact, Rachel, we heard that the court has scheduled a hearing on this motion tomorrow morning in Arizona. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=157.56s)]
*  So we're glad to see the federal courts are stepping in and stepping in quickly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=165.72s)]
*  After Donald Trump lost his election fair and square, the courts played an important role in making clear what the outcome of that election was. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=170.04s)]
*  Donald Trump then unleashed vigilantes to storm the Capitol. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=180.24s)]
*  And now we are seeing the return of that vigilanteism organized by the same factions of the Republican Party that were at play then. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=184.36s)]
*  And we need the courts once again to step up and take this seriously and prevent voters from being disenfranchised. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=192.84s)]
*  Now, the defendants in this case that you've brought include one of these sort of anti-voting rights pressure groups that have sprung up all over the country in recent years and have been particularly energized since the 2020 election. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=201.56s)]
*  Also, the founder of one of those groups is a named defendant in your case. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=214.48s)]
*  But I wanted to ask you about the role of the various Republican elected officials who have bolstered what these groups are doing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=217.96s)]
*  We've got the Republican candidate for secretary of state, the Republican candidate for governor. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=227.4s)]
*  We've got at least two that I know of sitting Republican state senators who are pushing this effort, who are encouraging people to turn out and be vigilantes at voting sites. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=231.56s)]
*  I wonder if you see some of these responsibility, some of these officials as bearing some of the same responsibility here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=242.48s)]
*  Absolutely. Republicans from top to bottom bear responsibility. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=248.6s)]
*  Where is Mitch McConnell calling this out? Where is Kevin McCarthy calling this out? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=252.0s)]
*  Where are the so-called responsible leaders of the Republican Party saying having armed vigilantes at the polls preventing people from casting their ballots in a legal way is wrong and they're going to denounce it? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=257.48s)]
*  Where are they? It's not just the Kerry Lates. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=269.84s)]
*  It's not just the state legislators in Arizona. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=272.44s)]
*  It is from top to bottom, a party that has abandoned democracy and has lost all semblance of decency. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=276.28s)]
*  You note in your lawsuit that several of these encounters have been referred to the U.S. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=283.44s)]
*  Justice Department as potentially illegal voter intimidation, asking effectively for prosecutions at the federal level in addition to a civil suit like yours. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=287.84s)]
*  But I wanted to ask you if you see the Justice Department as having a more immediate role here, whether or not they consider prosecutions for these things at the federal level, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=298.6s)]
*  should the Justice Department be sending monitors, be sending in personnel now to try to prevent the sorts of infringements on voter rights, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=308.16s)]
*  the voter intimidation that your lawsuit is calling out as such an immediate threat in this last 15 days? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=317.96s)]
*  Look, we need everyone at all levels of law enforcement to take this seriously. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=325.2s)]
*  I was glad to see that the Sheriff's Department, the local police in Maricopa County are stepping up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=330.96s)]
*  But this isn't their job alone. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=339.28s)]
*  And the Justice Department is headed by some really great civil rights lawyers, and I'm sure they're looking at their options. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=341.36s)]
*  But, you know, we're all going to have to do our part and bringing this civil lawsuit, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=348.32s)]
*  getting immediate relief for the voters in Maricopa County and the entire state of Arizona is my immediate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=353.32s)]
*  Mark Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  Keep us apprised. I'm interested to hear that the first hearing on this case is going to be tomorrow morning. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  It is intriguing that the courts are willing to move so quickly. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=370.67999999999995s)]
*  We'd love to stay apprised and up on the case. Thank you, Mark. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=373.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE5KVxRHy0&t=376.59999999999997s)]
