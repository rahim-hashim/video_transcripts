# Court Filings Expose Trump Pattern Of Exaggerating Values Of Real Estate Holdings
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4)
*  I'm going to quote here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=0.0s)]
*  With respect to Mr. Trump's triplex apartment in Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=2.08s)]
*  Tower, the Office of the Attorney General [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  has discovered that the valuations of this asset, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=6.08s)]
*  as incorporated into his statements [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=8.88s)]
*  of financial condition since at least 2012, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=10.4s)]
*  were based on the assertion that the triplex apartment was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=12.6s)]
*  30,000 square feet in size. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=15.32s)]
*  30,000. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=18.56s)]
*  The actual size of Trump's triplex apartment [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=20.1s)]
*  was only 10,996 square feet. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=21.92s)]
*  He lied about the actual square footage of his hands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=25.94s)]
*  I mean, his apartment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=29.44s)]
*  And not a little bit. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Not like he added an extra room. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=32.88s)]
*  He said it was three times as big as it actually was. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  And if you're thinking, oh, maybe he wasn't lying. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  Maybe he was just mistaken. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=41.8s)]
*  How many square feet is my apartment? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=43.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=44.88s)]
*  In this case, quote, documents demonstrating [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=46.88s)]
*  that the actual size of Mr. Trump's triplex apartment [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=49.32s)]
*  was only 10,996 square feet were easily [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=52.0s)]
*  accessible inside the Trump organization [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  and were signed by Mr. Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=57.68s)]
*  But the square footage is just the start. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=61.56s)]
*  There's also this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=64.32s)]
*  The supporting data for Trump's 2015 financial statement [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=65.2s)]
*  reported the value of his triplex apartment as $327 million. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=68.4s)]
*  This assertion was repeated in the supporting data [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=74.44s)]
*  for Trump's 2016 financial statement. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=76.68s)]
*  The valuation of Trump's triplex in the 2015 and 2016 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=79.0s)]
*  financial statements were overstated almost [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=82.84s)]
*  by a factor of three as the Trump organization's CFO, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=85.56s)]
*  Allen Weisselberg, conceded in his testimony [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=89.36s)]
*  to the attorney general's office. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=91.8s)]
*  Mr. Weisselberg admitted that the valuation [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=93.44s)]
*  of Trump's personal apartment amounted [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=97.56s)]
*  to an overstatement of, quote, give or take $200 million. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=99.84s)]
*  Give or take. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=106.72s)]
*  The error there, the overstatement was, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=107.64s)]
*  give or take $200 million. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=109.92s)]
*  Just for context here, as of last year, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=113.72s)]
*  the most expensive apartment on the market, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  not just in New York City, but in the entire nation, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=119.08s)]
*  the most expensive apartment in the country was $169 million. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=122.64s)]
*  Trump said his apartment was worth almost double that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=126.68s)]
*  Year after year in official financial statements, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=130.32s)]
*  he said his apartment was worth nearly twice as much [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=132.28s)]
*  as the most expensive apartment in the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=135.28s)]
*  And he said it was three times larger than it actually was, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=137.72s)]
*  which is wild and flagrant and almost impressively dishonest. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=142.4s)]
*  And it does make you think back to him bragging about his hand [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=147.88s)]
*  size at the debate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=151.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just too on the nose, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  But according to the New York attorney general, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=155.84s)]
*  it's not just an interesting personality pathology. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=157.76s)]
*  It was part of a pattern of behavior [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=162.84s)]
*  by Donald Trump and his company that was potentially illegal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Quote, since moving to compel the testimony of Donald Trump's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=168.52s)]
*  son, Eric Trump, in August 2020, the office of the attorney general [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=171.72s)]
*  has collected significant additional evidence indicating [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=175.16s)]
*  that the Trump organization used fraudulent or misleading asset [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=177.4s)]
*  valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=180.44s)]
*  including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=183.64s)]
*  New York attorney general, Letitia James, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=189.12s)]
*  has been investigating these potentially fraudulent practices [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=190.64s)]
*  for nearly three years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=193.76s)]
*  She's laying it out there, bank fraud, insurance fraud, tax fraud. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=195.84s)]
*  Now, there is a parallel criminal investigation [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=200.4s)]
*  that's being run by state prosecutors in the Manhattan DA's office. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  But this investigation by attorney general Letitia James, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=206.84s)]
*  this is a civil investigation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=209.56s)]
*  That means if she finds illegal activity, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=211.24s)]
*  she can bring a lawsuit against the Trump organization, which [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=214.08s)]
*  is kind of a bigger deal than it might seem on the surface. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=217.28000000000003s)]
*  Similar lawsuits from the New York attorney general's office, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=219.68s)]
*  after all, have succeeded in shutting down [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump's scam university, also his scam charity. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, they've apparently got their sights on his family business. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=229.56s)]
*  Letitia James says in these new filings [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  that her office has not yet determined [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=236.36s)]
*  whether they will take legal action against the Trump [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=238.28s)]
*  organization. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=240.36s)]
*  But their investigation would appear to be nearing its end [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=241.96s)]
*  because they're kind of going after the big fish, if you will. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=244.56s)]
*  The reason we got this filing late last night [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=249.0s)]
*  is that they're asking a court to compel testimony [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  from Donald Trump himself and from his son, Don Jr., [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=254.68s)]
*  and his daughter, Ivanka, who, of course, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=258.12s)]
*  are both intimately involved in running the family business. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=260.08s)]
*  In these latest filings, the attorney general [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=263.44s)]
*  lays out the most detailed allegations [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=265.2s)]
*  we have yet seen about the potentially fraudulent activity [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=267.0s)]
*  at the Trump family business that the AG is investigating. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=270.32s)]
*  And you can, I think, see it most easily [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=273.76s)]
*  if you don't try to look at the patterns more broadly, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=275.64s)]
*  but instead you just look at one property, just as an example. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=277.92s)]
*  The Trump family business owns an estate [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=283.16s)]
*  north of New York City in Westchester County [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=285.48s)]
*  in a place called Seven Springs. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=287.56s)]
*  Well, follow the bouncing ball here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=290.04s)]
*  Watch the money associated with Seven Springs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=292.48s)]
*  In 2004, Trump said it was worth $80 million. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=295.64s)]
*  Three years later, he said it was worth not $80 million, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  but $200 million. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=304.12s)]
*  A few years after that, it wasn't worth $280 million [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=306.32s)]
*  anymore. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=309.12s)]
*  It was worth $291 million. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=309.6s)]
*  What's happening there? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=312.12s)]
*  Some enormous flock of geese has moved into the pond [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=312.96s)]
*  and is laying golden eggs by the millions. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=315.68s)]
*  Where are all these extra millions coming from? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Then they brought in an actual professional appraiser [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=320.64s)]
*  to value the property. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=323.56s)]
*  And wouldn't you know it, the professional appraiser [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=324.76s)]
*  said the property was worth a maximum of $50 million. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=326.88s)]
*  I thought it was $281 million. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=333.32s)]
*  Even after that, the Trump organization [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=337.6s)]
*  insisted in its official financial statements [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=339.32s)]
*  that the property was worth $291 million. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=341.36s)]
*  How did they come to that valuation? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=345.12s)]
*  The basis of that valuation, per the records, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=347.76s)]
*  was quote, a telephone conversation with Eric Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=350.08s)]
*  That was the basis for the Trump organization's assertion [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=354.88s)]
*  that it was worth $291 million, despite an appraisal that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=358.36s)]
*  said it was worth $50 max. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=362.0s)]
*  How did they get to $291? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=364.44s)]
*  They asked Eric, and Eric said it was definitely [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=365.92s)]
*  worth $291 million. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=368.76s)]
*  And that, how can you argue with that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=370.36s)]
*  Seems legit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=372.24s)]
*  The New York attorney general's office writes, quote, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=374.56s)]
*  asked to explain various aspects of the 2012 and 2013 [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=376.8s)]
*  valuations. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=380.24s)]
*  Eric Trump repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=380.96s)]
*  In fact, according to the attorney general, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=385.12s)]
*  Eric Trump pled the fifth more than 500 times [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=386.76s)]
*  during his testimony to the attorney general's office. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=391.28s)]
*  And crucially, the attorney general [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=394.96s)]
*  alleges that all of this asset inflation [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=396.44s)]
*  was not just like bragging rights and puffery and hand [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=398.56s)]

*  She says the Trump organization, in some cases, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=403.6s)]
*  was using this kind of information [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=405.92s)]
*  to actively lie to banks or insurance companies [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  about where these valuations were coming from, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=412.44s)]
*  for the purpose of doing business with those banks [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=415.04s)]
*  and insurance companies. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=417.12s)]
*  Quote, representations to an insurance company [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=418.68s)]
*  that the valuations listed in Trump's personal financial [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=420.8s)]
*  statements were prepared annually [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=423.16s)]
*  by professional appraisal firms, those representations [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=424.92s)]
*  were false. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  The valuations were prepared, in fact, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  by Trump organization staff, contrary to what [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=431.96s)]
*  the insurance company was expressly told and believed. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=434.84s)]
*  So it's one thing to make up fantastical valuations [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=439.56s)]
*  for your properties. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=443.96s)]
*  It's another thing to go to an insurance company [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  in order to do business with that insurance company [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  on the basis of those fantastical assertions [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=450.24s)]
*  of the value of these properties. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=453.12s)]
*  And then to tell those insurance companies, and by the way, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=455.0s)]
*  that appraisal came from the pros. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=457.96s)]
*  That's a professionally done thing, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=459.44s)]
*  when in fact it was not, when in fact it was like a call [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=461.12s)]
*  to Eric or somebody else working in the Trump organization, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=463.28000000000003s)]

*  may have lied to the IRS. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=471.44s)]
*  He got tax deductions worth millions of dollars [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=473.96s)]
*  on the seven Springs estate. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=476.12s)]
*  Those deductions appear to have been based [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=477.68s)]
*  on a wildly inflated valuation, based in part [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=479.4s)]
*  on what the Trump organization asserted were seven mansions [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=482.64s)]
*  on the property, but those are mansions that did not exist. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=486.08s)]
*  That's just one example. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  That's just one Trump property. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  That's all the seven Springs place in Westchester. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=494.32s)]
*  The attorney general has filed over 150 pages [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  with the court as of last night, covering many, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=499.64s)]
*  many properties, many of which have other stories [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=501.56s)]
*  like this one. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbiz2ZooV4&t=503.88s)]
