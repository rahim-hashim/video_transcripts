# Ukraine Seizes Assets Of Putin Ally In Crackdown On Russian Corruption
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw)
*  This is one of those segments that has a lot of visuals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=0.0s)]
*  So, if you're watching the dishes or, like, doing some of everything, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=3.6s)]
*  this is one that's worth seeing, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  because they've got access to his house now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  And the house, you can tell from the outside, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=11.84s)]
*  is designed to look like a palace. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=13.68s)]
*  It kind of looks like a cross between a palace and a bank, maybe. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=16.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=19.92s)]
*  The building is clearly being remodeled. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=21.84s)]
*  It's being renovated. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=24.28s)]
*  But all the stuff is there, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=26.16s)]
*  including all his art stuff. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=28.76s)]
*  There's a huge rack of gigantic paintings. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=30.92s)]
*  Look at the size of them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  They're like mural-sized paintings, but in big gold frames. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=34.84s)]
*  There's also a whole other rack of paintings [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=38.28s)]
*  that appears to all be just portraits of the same woman. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=40.52s)]
*  I think that's all portraits of the wife. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  There's also a closet full of designer clothes for her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  There's also a weird room full of boxed jewelry and boxed trinkets and things. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=52.44s)]
*  I'm not totally sure what some of those things are. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=57.84s)]
*  There's a room full of antiques, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=60.96s)]
*  including certificates of authenticity for the various antiques. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  So that's what's inside. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=68.04s)]
*  But then you go outside onto the grounds, and this is weird. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of waggling around a little bit in the breeze. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=72.12s)]
*  What's that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=75.0s)]
*  It's covered in military camouflage netting, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=75.92s)]
*  so it really isn't easy to see what that is. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=78.16s)]
*  Presumably, that makes it not easy to see from above. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=80.84s)]
*  But honestly, it's even kind of hard to figure out [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=83.64s)]
*  what it is from the ground, as you can see here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=85.36s)]
*  Well, if you pop inside, as that guy does, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=88.4s)]
*  you can see what is in there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=91.52s)]
*  What's in there? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=93.0s)]
*  Oh, my God, look. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=94.72s)]
*  It's a fake train station. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=96.52s)]
*  Now, to be clear, this is not a real train station. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=99.8s)]
*  There are no railroad tracks that lead into or out of this thing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=102.48s)]
*  that looks like a little rail station. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=106.28s)]
*  It's like, see the benches and everything and the little lamps? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=108.08s)]
*  It's a replica, a train station replica. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=110.88s)]
*  But sitting on the fake tracks at the fake train station [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=114.64s)]
*  in this guy's yard is a fake train car, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=117.88s)]
*  a personal fake train car. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=120.52s)]
*  And look, these guys, it's so sweet. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=123.32s)]
*  They put on plastic boot covers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=124.72s)]
*  so they won't mess up the carpet when they go in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=126.32s)]
*  But then they go in and look at it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  This train car, it's like the Orient Express. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=131.04s)]
*  It's all red velvet and hand-carved hardwood and gold. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=133.96s)]
*  Everything that looks gold actually is gold. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=138.04s)]
*  And this isn't like some lovingly restored antique [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=141.64s)]
*  because this guy just loves the classic era of train travel. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=144.4s)]
*  And some rich guy rescued and restored this old train car. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  No, this is apparently a newly built thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a fake Pullman train car inside a fake train station [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=153.84s)]
*  stuffed with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gold fittings [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=158.88s)]
*  and expensive silver. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=162.4s)]
*  The coffee machine is gold plated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=165.36s)]
*  The crystal tumblers have the seal of the Russian Federation on them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And you know this is coming. You know this is coming. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=174.0s)]
*  Yes, there is a gold toilet with a gold holder for the toilet brush. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  There's a gold hose on the bidet, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  which is like a little rinsy thing for your business end. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Does the hose for that really have to be gold given its function? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Really? Yes, yes, everything must be gold, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=194.24s)]
*  including the thing you squirt. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=197.56s)]
*  This is just astonishing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this this astonishment, this thing with the gold, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=202.92s)]
*  everything and the the stained glass ceiling inside the fake rail car [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=207.16s)]
*  and the gold crests everywhere that are real gold. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=211.92s)]
*  This belongs to this gentleman. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=217.32s)]
*  His name is Victor Medvedchuk. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  He is now under arrest in Ukraine, having previously been charged with treason. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=223.72s)]
*  This train car parked in his yard in the fake train station, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  parked in his yard, was reportedly a gift from his wife sometime last year, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=232.64s)]
*  a birthday present, a little special thing for him to play with. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=236.76s)]
*  Victor Medvedchuk, do you by any chance remember [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=240.64s)]
*  that when candidate Donald Trump hired a campaign chairman in 2016, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=244.55999999999997s)]
*  for whatever reason, he chose this guy, Paul Manafort, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=248.92s)]
*  a man with whom he had no prior relationship. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=251.44s)]
*  Paul Manafort, for years, had been working overseas, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  getting paid by Putin connected corrupt oligarchs [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=257.8s)]
*  to install Putin connected corrupt politicians [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=261.08s)]
*  in positions of power in the nation of Ukraine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=264.88s)]
*  That book I wrote called Blowout is about how Putin weaponized oil and gas [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=269.08s)]
*  and corruption to try to keep Ukraine and other neighboring countries weak [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=274.52s)]
*  and dependent on Russia and under Putin's thumb. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, when Donald Trump inexplicably hired Manafort to run his campaign in 2016, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=281.2s)]
*  that was what Paul Manafort specialized in, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  weakening other countries by installing compromised, corrupt Russian puppets [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=289.12s)]
*  who would do Putin's bidding in the political leadership of other countries. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=293.92s)]
*  That was what he was doing for a living. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=298.24s)]
*  And then Trump hired him. Weird. Why would we want that in America? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=301.16s)]
*  What a weird skill set to bring to an American campaign. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=304.64s)]
*  Anyway, but in Ukraine, in his work in Ukraine, Manafort's most famous client [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=309.48s)]
*  was the Ukrainian prime minister. He got elected there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=314.08s)]
*  A pro-Putin puppet named Yanukovych. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=316.76s)]
*  Yanukovych, you might remember, fled to Moscow when Ukrainians rose up [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=320.32s)]
*  and threw him out of office. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=323.84s)]
*  And you might remember from segments here on this show that after Yanukovych fled, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=325.48s)]
*  the Ukrainian people started going into his various houses and palaces [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=329.92s)]
*  that he had all over Ukraine. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=334.08s)]
*  And that's how they learned that he, too, had gold toilets. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  What is it with these guys? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=340.08s)]
*  At least Yanukovych had a toilet with weird gold, like, lizardy feet [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=341.48s)]
*  and a gold flusher and, yes, a gold bidet for the squirting. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=347.04s)]
*  Yanukovych also had a private zoo. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=352.24s)]
*  In his case, he didn't have a fake gold-plated personal train car, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=355.44s)]
*  like Medvedchuk. Yanukovych instead had a fake gold-plated personal Spanish galleon [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=358.92s)]
*  that he floated on his private lake and used as his own private restaurant. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=365.52s)]
*  Classy, these guys. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=370.56s)]
*  Well, Yanukovych is gone, fled back to Moscow. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=372.76s)]
*  And now it's Viktor Medvedchuk, the man with the gold-plated fake train car [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  who's, as of this week, under arrest in Ukraine for treason. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=381.12s)]
*  He was also one of Paul Manafort's guys in Ukraine. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=385.12s)]
*  Medvedchuk is one of the richest men in Ukraine. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=388.32s)]
*  He is linked, obviously, to the Russian government. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=390.76s)]
*  He has always worked for Putin's interests in Ukraine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=393.44s)]
*  He was part of the whole operation that Manafort ran [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  to install Putin-connected puppets and positions of power in Ukraine. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  Putin is godfather to one of Medvedchuk's daughters. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=403.48s)]
*  It was therefore unsettling when we learned that Medvedchuk [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=407.0s)]
*  had been one of the Trump campaign's contacts in 2016 [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  when Russia was intervening in our election to try to help get Trump into the White House. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=414.44000000000005s)]
*  But now the Ukrainians have arrested Viktor Medvedchuk. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=420.8s)]
*  They have taken his assets, including the train car. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=423.48s)]
*  They've taken his assets and those of all the other oligarchs [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=427.76s)]
*  who are working for the Russian Federation inside Ukraine. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=430.24s)]
*  Ukraine announced today that just from Medvedchuk alone, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=433.36s)]
*  they have seized 30 plots of land, 23 houses, 32 apartments, 26 cars and one yacht. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=436.68s)]
*  And presumably that one fake train car and its bedazzled golden hose [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=445.0s)]
*  for squirting water up at the caboose. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=450.48s)]
*  Just as Russian oligarchs the world over are having their yachts seized and their assets frozen, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine too is trying to free itself of what Russia has been doing to them [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=462.24s)]
*  by weaponizing corruption to create these powerful, rich, pro-Putin power centers [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=466.56s)]
*  inside their country to keep their country corrupt, weak, destabilized, dependent on Russia. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=472.68s)]
*  But today, a big new step. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  Today, Europe, the European Union, finally took the first step [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=482.04s)]
*  toward actually pulling the plug on Russia's power, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  toward actually dismantling Russia as a state, at least as the kind of state it is now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=488.72s)]
*  Because the European Union today began drafting a measure [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  that would ban the purchase of Russian oil and gas. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=498.6s)]
*  If there is one thing that could end Putin's Russia as we know it, it would be that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=502.36s)]
*  Will they really do it? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-x6amWZfKw&t=508.8s)]
