# Ukrainian Mechanic Partially Sinks Russian Oligarch's Yacht
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc)
*  All right, her name is Lady Anastasia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=0.0s)]
*  She is a $7 million super yacht owned by a Russian arms tycoon and the chief executive [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=2.9s)]
*  of Russia's state-owned defense conglomerate that exports weapons. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=8.2s)]
*  And right now, that yacht is docked on the island of Majorca in the Mediterranean. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=11.42s)]
*  And a yacht like this, I should note, needs a lot of care, a lot of maintenance. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=16.14s)]
*  They usually have a full-time staff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=20.16s)]
*  And in the case of Lady Anastasia, a mechanic, the mechanic for Lady Anastasia is this guy, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=22.64s)]
*  a 55-year-old engineer from Ukraine named Taras Ostapchuk. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=28.28s)]
*  And over the weekend, that mechanic says that he saw a video of a rocket attack on this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=32.88s)]
*  residential building in Kiev, where he is from. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=37.24s)]
*  And he says that when he was watching that video, something clicked, something changed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=40.64s)]
*  And he remembered that his boss is not only Russian, but in fact that he is a Russian [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=45.52s)]
*  arms dealer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=50.42s)]
*  The mechanic says he believes the missile he saw in that video was the same type of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=51.7s)]
*  missile manufactured and sold by his boss. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=56.16s)]
*  So the mechanic allegedly marched onto the engine room of the superyacht and opened [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=61.099999999999994s)]
*  up several valves that were supposed to stay shut, which partially sank the Lady Anastasia. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=65.84s)]
*  And that Ukrainian mechanic was arrested, brought to court in Majorca for allegedly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=71.32s)]
*  trying to sink the Russian man's yacht. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=75.24s)]
*  He told the judge, quote, they were attacking innocents, and I don't regret anything I've [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=78.16s)]
*  done, and I would do it again. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=82.16s)]
*  That mechanic has since been released from custody, and he tells us he is now back in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=84.46s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  He is on a waitlist to be issued a weapon so he can join the fight himself. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  The mechanic felt left custody for Ukraine, left Spain, got there so he can help defend [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  his country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=102.22s)]
*  That's him in this photo alongside his compatriots. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=103.3s)]
*  An act of heroic sabotage. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcednYjKhc&t=108.72s)]
