# Days from inauguration, Trump looks to walk back some campaign promises
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0)
*  Trump himself went on Meet the Press with Kristen Malker and told her that he won the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=0.0s)]
*  election because of grocery prices. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=4.58s)]
*  I won on groceries. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Then he went to Time magazine and said, yeah, I don't think I'm going to be able to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=10.48s)]
*  bring down grocery prices. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=13.08s)]
*  It's really hard to do, did you know? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=14.56s)]
*  Trump said that he was going to end Russia's war in Ukraine in one day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=18.28s)]
*  And he didn't even say he'd do it one day after he was sworn in. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=23.6s)]
*  He said he'd do it one day after he was elected back in November. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  Well, gee, that didn't happen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=31.28s)]
*  Now his Ukraine envoy says, hmm, maybe we'll need 100 days. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=34.32s)]
*  Trump says, I think we'll try for six months. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=40.0s)]
*  In this transition, Trump explicitly and out loud and in public told the Republicans in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=45.32s)]
*  Congress to shut down the government unless and until they abolished the debt ceiling. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=50.22s)]
*  Republicans in Congress did not shut down the government, nor did they abolish the debt [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=57.5s)]
*  ceiling. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  Trump put eccentric right-wing billionaire Elon Musk in charge of enacting this radical [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=62.94s)]
*  austerity plan for the United States. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=67.22s)]
*  He said he would cut at least, at least $2 trillion from U.S. spending. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=69.9s)]
*  At least $2 trillion he's going to cut. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=76.9s)]
*  Now Musk himself is saying, maybe we'll get to $1 trillion, maybe. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=79.1s)]
*  There's a good shot at getting to $1 trillion, maybe. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=83.69999999999999s)]
*  Even though Trump keeps saying all those austerity cuts won't affect anything the American [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=89.02s)]
*  people care about at all, nobody's going to feel these cuts, House Republicans decided [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=93.0s)]
*  to roll out their roadmap of where they intend to make all of these cuts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  And it turns out mostly they're just planning on cutting your health care. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=105.38s)]
*  He never said he was going to cut our health care. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=107.22s)]
*  He didn't run on that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=108.74s)]
*  He said it was all just going to be waste. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=109.74s)]
*  That Elon Musk would find the waste. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=113.22s)]
*  I mean, as transitions go, this has been, this has been a very bad presidential transition, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=116.06s)]
*  and we should describe it as such. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=124.74s)]
*  I mean, it has been incoherent. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=126.41999999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=129.78s)]
*  This whole January 6th pardon controversy, the vice president-elect, J.D. Vance, says [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  Nobody's getting a pardon if they were violent on January 6th. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=137.10000000000002s)]
*  Trump asked the same question, says, yeah, maybe, maybe they will. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=140.66000000000003s)]
*  Oh, but he also says at the same event that maybe Hezbollah did January 6th. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=143.9s)]
*  So make of that what you will. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  It's been incoherent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=150.86s)]
*  It's been incompetent on policy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=152.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=154.38000000000002s)]
*  Grocery prices are hard. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=155.38000000000002s)]
*  It's been incompetent on politics, making Republicans sign on to these horrific nominees [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  and then pulling the nominees anyway. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=163.58s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=165.58s)]
*  It's even been incompetent just on process. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=167.58s)]
*  I mean, their confirmation hearings are finally starting tomorrow, but we're only having [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=172.58s)]
*  one instead of the three they scheduled because they had the last minute canceled. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=176.46s)]
*  The other two they scheduled because they just couldn't get it together to do them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  They can't even manage to start hearings for their own nominees when their own party [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=184.58s)]
*  controls the Senate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=188.46s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=189.46s)]
*  Thank goodness they're picking up the nuclear codes next week. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=190.46s)]
*  They seem so together. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeeQke84gw0&t=193.54000000000002s)]
