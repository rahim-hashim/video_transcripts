# Shifting Battle Lines Make Progress Difficult To Discern In Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU)
*  The city of Mikhail I have has also taken heavy losses that is as it holds off Russia's attempt to seize it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=0.0s)]
*  But a senior US official says Ukrainian defenses have not only kept Russian troops from making progress [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=6.3s)]
*  They forced them to reposition around the city [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=11.8s)]
*  Because of stories like this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=15.3s)]
*  It was hard not to be encouraged when the mayor of Kiev told reporters that Ukrainian forces had retaken the suburb of Makarov [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=16.68s)]
*  But my next guest Sudarsan Raghavan a correspondent at large for the Washington Post [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=25.38s)]
*  Learned that the situation on the ground is not as clear as what the mayor stated [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=30.08s)]
*  Here's what he wrote in a piece for the Washington Post quote as a team of Washington Post [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=35.56s)]
*  Journalists passed through the checkpoint on Wednesday [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=40.08s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers ordered them to quickly leave the town warning of oncoming Russian rockets or military [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=43.2s)]
*  artillery [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Minutes later reporters heard the sound of shells falling black plumes of smoke rose over the houses soon more blasts followed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=51.04s)]
*  Makarov remains a contested front line end quote joining us now is the author of that story [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=60.04s)]
*  Sudarsan Raghavan mr. Raghavan good to see you again. Thank you for being with us tonight. Give us the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=66.72s)]
*  The nuance of this because for those who have not spent time in a city or that's under conflict or a war zone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=72.4s)]
*  How do these things look when the Russians say they've taken it and the Ukrainians say they've taken it back? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=79.44s)]
*  It's it's it's blurry. It's not it's not like an old-fashioned front line [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=84.68s)]
*  Not at all especially in this information age [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=90.84s)]
*  I mean what we're really seeing here is two different wars happening then they're intertwined wars [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=93.24s)]
*  Happening in Ukraine one that's on the battlefield and the other one that's an information war and what happened in my car is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=98.28s)]
*  Exemplifies these two different wars what you had was the fog of war as well as a propaganda campaign by both sides [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=104.92s)]
*  It's made really solid information hard to come by so [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=111.32s)]
*  Journalists are increasingly finding it difficult to reach areas outside the capital to independently verify facts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=115.28s)]
*  Due to bombardments shifting front lines and just a lack of clarity over the Russian military positions [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=121.28s)]
*  So oftentimes, you know, you're you're relying on statements from Ukrainian officials as what happened with that with incident Makariev on Tuesday [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=127.0s)]
*  the the defense ministry claimed that the town had been liberated from [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=135.96s)]
*  From Russian forces and the Ukrainian force has had planted a flag Ukrainian flag on top of the town [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=140.88s)]
*  So we went the next day to check it out [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=146.48s)]
*  And as you've read in the article we found that it was anything but liberated [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  in fact [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=153.64s)]
*  the mayor himself told us that this is just all a bunch of nonsense and in fact the Russians were still in control of nearly [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=154.32s)]
*  15% of the town and it had been like that the past three weeks [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=161.88s)]
*  So the there were tit-for-tat battles in the town just like what you're seeing in other parts of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=165.34s)]
*  Ukraine especially the north of here in the town of Erpin, but the Russians definitely had not liberated by any means [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=171.54s)]
*  in this town [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=180.06s)]
*  So when you talk about Erpin or Makariev or places like that, what does taken or liberated even mean? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  How does how does that get determined? We definitely hear about flags being [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  Being flown that of course is the age-old way in which you claim [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=193.5s)]
*  Land that that wasn't otherwise under your control. But what does it mean in these in these towns? Do things keep working? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=197.38s)]
*  Does the City Council change allegiances? What happens when the Russians take territory? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=203.78s)]
*  Well, it's a very chaotic situation still [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=210.78s)]
*  I mean people even in Makariev and you hear people are still evacuating from these areas even as these claims liberation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=212.94s)]
*  Take place [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  They're still fighting. There's still [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=222.5s)]
*  Shelling going on this in Makariev the Russian tanks position right outside the town shelling it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=225.26s)]
*  So it's a very chaotic situation like the mayor for example of this town [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=231.42s)]
*  his main job is to go around now today and try to feed people try to deal with the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=235.82s)]
*  People who are lost their homes from shelling many of them actually are we were told or huddled in a hospital [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=241.7s)]
*  Inside the town and that hospital is getting shelled as well [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=248.3s)]
*  So does the mayor has to deal with all these? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=251.54s)]
*  Extremely very chaotic situation to really preserve the lives of his residents and in some cases trying to get him out and for those [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=254.26s)]
*  Who don't want to leave who want to stick it out? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=262.04s)]
*  He has to find ways to help them deal with electricity source shortages water shortages gas and all the other necessities of life [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=264.76s)]
*  You [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWLTolHCCOU&t=277.78s)]
