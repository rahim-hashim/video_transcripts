# Russia Compounds Failure To Conquer Ukrainians By Also Failing To Intimidate Them
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo)
*  Let's talk about something that John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesperson, said earlier today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=0.0s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=5.24s)]
*  Let's listen together. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  They failed to take Kiev, which we believe was a key objective. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=7.68s)]
*  Not only did they not manage to take Kiev, they've not managed to take any population [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  centers, and the Ukrainians have been fighting back very hard. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=18.88s)]
*  So it's hard to see how they are succeeding in any one place, except, except at the death [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=21.8s)]
*  and destruction they're causing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=29.76s)]
*  He's talking a lot about the death and destruction, and a number of people have wondered over [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=33.88s)]
*  the last few days whether the failure, the tactical failure of the Russian military on [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=38.44s)]
*  the ground, the failure to take places like Kiev, the failure to make more progress, is [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=43.96s)]
*  now being compensated for by Russia with this death, with this destruction, with the scorched [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=48.52s)]
*  earth policy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=54.72s)]
*  Tell me your thoughts on this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=55.72s)]
*  Yes, that is scorched earth policy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=58.6s)]
*  That's the best term. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=61.24s)]
*  And yes, I think they want to use this terror just to make Ukraine to accept their demands, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=63.4s)]
*  and they want to make Ukraine to surrender. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=73.32s)]
*  They are again making a mistake. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=76.84s)]
*  Like they made a mistake attacking Ukraine, thinking that the state will collapse, that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=79.56s)]
*  people will not fight for their land, and they made a big mistake, as the whole world [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=86.16s)]
*  now sees that Ukrainians are fighting enormously with all fury for their land. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=91.28s)]
*  The same is with this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=98.72s)]
*  Trying to scare our people, they just make them more furious, and that will not work. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=100.8s)]
*  But what can be done by the world, not just watching at least all full pictures, but to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  help us is to provide Ukraine with air defense, because for all these attacks, mostly they're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=112.8s)]
*  using air or aircraft or missiles, which can be intercepted by air defense. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=118.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, Ukraine is still waiting. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  The second month of war is on the place, but we are still waiting for really powerful air [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=126.96s)]
*  defense systems. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  So we are not asking for NATO specialists, but we are asking for weapons which will protect [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  our women and children and which will stop this awful refugee crisis. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=140.68s)]
*  More than three million Ukrainians already left the country, but more than six million [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=146.56s)]
*  Ukrainians are internally displaced people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  So they are in the country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=153.72s)]
*  They want to come back to their homes, but they can't do this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=155.56s)]
*  And if these attacks will not be stopped, they will also probably, at least part of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=159.56s)]
*  them will need to leave the country and the refugee crisis will worsen. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=164.08s)]
*  Alex, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=169.44s)]
*  Alex Gonshurenko is a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X383o1TirAo&t=171.0s)]
