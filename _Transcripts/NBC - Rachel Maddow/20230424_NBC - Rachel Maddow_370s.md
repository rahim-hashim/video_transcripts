# Carlson crisis threatens right-wing media ability to carry feckless Republican Party
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U)
*  Success in conservative media is a thing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=0.0s)]
*  There's always someone. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=3.92s)]
*  It does not tend to translate to success anywhere other than the conservative media. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=6.4s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=11.0s)]
*  I mean, conservative media itself is a very big business. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=12.4s)]
*  It is very slick. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=15.52s)]
*  It is very successful as an entity. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=16.44s)]
*  In a way, I'm sorry to say that partisan liberal media never has been. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=19.28s)]
*  Not for one of trying, trust me, I know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=23.44s)]
*  But what's actually important for the country, I think, here, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=26.72s)]
*  is understanding what conservative media does. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=30.64s)]
*  Not overstating dominant conservative media figures as somehow standing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=34.52s)]
*  bestride American culture and making things happen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=39.44s)]
*  They all only exist in terms of their influence within conservative media. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=42.24s)]
*  But conservative media and the conservative movement are very effective. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=46.6s)]
*  They're rich, effective, successful, thriving enterprises. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And for at least the past generation, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=55.4s)]
*  that really is where the political success has been on the American right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=58.56s)]
*  It's in conservative media and in the conservative movement. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  That's where they are strongest. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=67.2s)]
*  And conservative media and the conservative movement tend to drag the actual [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=71.0s)]
*  Republican Party around like a rag doll that's missing a limb or two. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=74.6s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party is comparatively very weak, very disorganized, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=78.24s)]
*  and has no idea how to talk to people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=81.88s)]
*  The Republican Party has lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=83.92s)]
*  presidential elections. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=87.88s)]
*  I mean, look at the headlines in the other news from the right right now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=90.72s)]
*  News that's not about the conservative media, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=94.76s)]
*  news that's about the Republican Party. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=97.36s)]
*  Keep in mind that we are a democracy and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=99.88s)]
*  your success as a political party depends on people liking your ideas and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=101.56s)]
*  voting for them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=104.88s)]
*  Look at what they're running on right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=106.12s)]
*  Look at what they're doing in governance right now and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=108.08s)]
*  think about the popularity of these things with the average American. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=110.12s)]
*  Look at the headlines right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=113.36s)]
*  Republicans voting to roll back child labor laws. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Lobbyists have found remarkable success among Republicans to relax regulations [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=119.44s)]
*  that prevent American children from working long hours in dangerous conditions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=124.36s)]
*  Okay, so they're crusading against child labor laws. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=130.16s)]
*  Republicans in Missouri vote to shut all public libraries. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=134.4s)]
*  Yeah, Americans sure hate libraries. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=139.6s)]
*  Republican controlled states go after millions of American families who right [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  now have health insurance because Republicans want to take away that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=146.04s)]
*  health insurance from millions of American families and leave them with nothing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=150.6s)]
*  That'll be popular. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=155.92s)]
*  Republicans fighting right now in dozens of states to load people up with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=157.32s)]
*  student loans they otherwise wouldn't have to deal with. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  Everybody's gonna love that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  Republicans blocking rape victims from receiving emergency [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  contraception because who among us doesn't see a mainstream American voting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=171.96s)]
*  issue enforcing women who have been raped. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=176.08s)]
*  Forcing women who have been raped to bear the child of the rapist against their will. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=180.0s)]
*  That's a winning issue for the voters, I'm sure. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Republicans all over the country not only banning abortion, which is radically [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=190.0s)]
*  unpopular in this country, but now in multiple states, they are changing the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=195.28s)]
*  rules of how laws can be made in those states so the people who live in those [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=199.0s)]
*  states will no longer be able to vote for abortion rights even if that's what they want. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=203.28s)]
*  I mean, look at it in terms of their high dollar candidates. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=209.84s)]
*  The guy polling second for the Republican nomination for president right now is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=212.88s)]
*  hoping to coast to the White House on the popularity of him just signing a total ban [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=216.72s)]
*  on abortion and also instituting book bans and attacking Disney. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=221.12s)]
*  What, no puppies to kick? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=227.0s)]
*  The guy polling first for the Republican nomination for president was just indicted [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=228.8s)]
*  on 34 felonies and tomorrow's the day that the civil suit against him starts related [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=232.96s)]
*  to the rape claims. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=238.08s)]
*  And I mean, that's just like today. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  A snapshot of how things are going with the Republican Party and their effort to win [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=245.8s)]
*  over the American people to the popularity of their ideas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  And it's kind of been like that for a while. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=254.8s)]
*  And in contrast, the conservative media business and the conservative movement, they have [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=256.6s)]
*  their act together when you compare them to the Republican Party. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=264.36s)]
*  They, for example, are very successful both at what they try to do and in pure business [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  terms. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=273.16s)]
*  They are slick and they are powerful, at least they have been. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=273.76000000000005s)]
*  And they really are responsible for the success of the political right in this country in a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=278.0s)]
*  way that I'm sorry, you just cannot credit to the work of the Republican Party. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not credit to the work of the Republican Party itself, because when the Republican [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=285.36s)]
*  Party, when Republican Party politicians are left to do their thing, look at what they do. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=289.16s)]
*  So now here's the question. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=298.32s)]
*  The conservative media right now today is in one of its periodic crises, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  They just today have lopped off another another one of their episodically dominant figures [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=305.24s)]
*  who, for whatever reason, hasn't worked out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=310.88s)]
*  But he really is one of a string of them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=314.0s)]
*  There will be someone after him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=316.52s)]
*  And the important question, aside from the gossip and the business news and all that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=319.04s)]
*  stuff, the important question for our country is about the success of that business, the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=323.64s)]
*  success of that industry, whether that remarkably successful industry as a whole is today at [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=329.04s)]
*  any risk of losing its judge, its its power, its capacity, importantly, to drag the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=335.36s)]
*  Republican Party around in its wake, no matter how hapless that party is and remains. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=342.68s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZboCOp8uM9U&t=348.56s)]
