# Maddow Announces Upcoming Hiatus To Work On Bag Man And Other Projects
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0)
*  I have one other announcement before we get underway tonight. A couple of years ago, you may [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=0.0s)]
*  remember, I did a podcast, a relatively short seven-episode single-arch podcast called Bagman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=5.36s)]
*  And it was about Nixon's vice president, Spiro Agnew, and him renting a bribery and extortion [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=14.96s)]
*  ring out of the White House. These young federal prosecutors in Maryland basically stumbled onto [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=20.88s)]
*  the evidence of him being a crook and literally taking envelopes of cash across his desk while [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=26.4s)]
*  being a public official. They put together this criminal case against him, even though he was the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=32.72s)]
*  sitting vice president. And it was all right in the middle of Watergate. It was only thanks to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=37.04s)]
*  those prosecutors that we didn't end up with President Agnew when Nixon resigned in disgrace. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=41.76s)]
*  It would have been after the national trauma and disgrace of Watergate, it would next have been [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=48.8s)]
*  President Agnew, the felon, presumably taking envelopes full of cash in the Oval Office instead [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=55.92s)]
*  of in his vice presidential office. Had these prosecutors not followed their case to the end [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  and forced Agnew to resign, that is what would have happened. I still think it's just an absolutely [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=66.72s)]
*  amazing story. It also turns out to be the very surprising origin story of why the Justice Department [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=71.04s)]
*  thinks a sitting president can't be criminally indicted, even if he definitely commits terrible [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=79.12s)]
*  crimes while he is in office. That of course was put to the test like never before under the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=84.88s)]
*  twice-impeached coup-plotting President Donald Trump who we just had, but where that whole [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=91.6s)]
*  construct came from that you can't indict a sitting president, that actually came from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  this Bureau Agnew nightmare in the 1970s. Anyway, I'm still fascinated by the story. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=100.72s)]
*  I've actually learned a lot more and discovered a lot more about Agnew and that whole period of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  history since we launched that podcast. The reason I'm telling you this is because it's now [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=111.28s)]
*  going to be a movie. Ben Stiller is going to direct it. He's incredible. One of the producers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=117.12s)]
*  of the film is Lorne Michaels. Yes, that Lorne Michaels. This has been in the works for a while [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  now, but it looks like it's going to happen. I am super excited about it and I am going to take a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=127.28s)]
*  little bit of time off from this show to go help with the movie and also to work on some other [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=136.08s)]
*  things that I have cooking with NBC right now, including a new podcast kind of along the lines [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=142.56s)]
*  of Bagman and the Spiro Agnew story. It's on a totally different topic, but when I say along [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  the same lines, I mean to say it's got a specific arc. It's a specific story. It's a reported [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=154.88000000000002s)]
*  journalistic tale. It's not just like a jibber jabber podcast where I chat with people and admit [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=161.36s)]
*  I haven't done the reading. It's a real thing on a story that I've been starting to research and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=166.32s)]
*  report for the last few months now. I am super excited about it. Super excited to tell you about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=171.44s)]
*  it when I have more to tell. Just like late night hosts sometimes go on hiatus in their shows, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=175.76s)]
*  I am going to go on hiatus for a little bit here from this show so I can work on some of those [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=183.44s)]
*  other projects. In addition to the movie, the Bagman movie and the podcast that I'm working on, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=187.12s)]
*  the paperback of the Bagman book is also coming out in just a few weeks. It's coming out in April. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=193.68s)]
*  There's also an adaptation of a different book that I want to try to make for TV as well that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=199.36s)]
*  I've just started working on. There's all this stuff I've been working on that I want to work [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=204.16s)]
*  some more on. So as you can tell, I'm nervous about all this. It's a change in my life, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=208.16s)]
*  but it's all for the good. I will be here this week through Thursday of this week, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=215.2s)]
*  and then the hiatus means I'm just going to be off for a few weeks, off from doing the show. I'm [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=220.0s)]
*  not really going anywhere. I'll be back for the State of the Union and for other big news events. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=223.6s)]
*  In the meantime, I will also be back doing the show again before you'll even miss me. I'll be [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=228.64s)]
*  back in April. There may eventually be another hiatus again sometime in my future, but for now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=232.88s)]
*  we're just taking it one step at a time. Again, I'll be here through Thursday this week, and then [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=239.76s)]
*  I'm going to have a few weeks off. Of course, while I'm away, the show will continue to be run [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=243.68s)]
*  by the absolute best producers in this entire business, by the amazing staff of this show. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=248.56s)]
*  So don't worry. You will be in very, very good hands. Change is good. Change is absolutely [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=253.84s)]
*  terrifying, but in this case, it's good. So now you know. Let's never speak of this again. Okay. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n37TFHhZKh0&t=261.6s)]
