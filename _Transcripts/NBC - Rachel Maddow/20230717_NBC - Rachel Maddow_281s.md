# Trump, Republican allies make plan to concentrate power in Trump's hands: NYTimes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k)
*  You might have seen there's this big New York Times story today, big story, very important [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=0.0s)]
*  story about how the leading Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, and Republicans more [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=4.2s)]
*  broadly have this plan that they want to put in place if the Republican Party wins the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  presidency in 2024. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=17.88s)]
*  They're calling it Project 2025 because this is a plan that's supposed to go into effect [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=20.96s)]
*  upon the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2025. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=28.32s)]
*  Either Trump or some other Republican president gets inaugurated in January of 2025 and Project [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=32.24s)]
*  2025 thereby goes into effect. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=37.92s)]
*  This plan is being coordinated by a right-wing think tank called the Heritage Foundation, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=41.26s)]
*  and it is a plan to radically change the form of governance that we have in the United [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=46.32s)]
*  States so as to concentrate all the power of the government in the hands of a single [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=52.44s)]
*  leader. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=59.12s)]
*  Quote, our current executive branch was conceived of by liberals. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=60.12s)]
*  What's necessary is a complete system overhaul. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=65.36s)]
*  Quote, what we're trying to do is identify the pockets of independence inside the U.S. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=68.36s)]
*  government and seize them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=74.84s)]
*  So there won't be any more pockets of independent power outside the pockets, outside the power [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=79.11999999999999s)]
*  that is held by the president. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=84.44s)]
*  Now, as I said, they want this to be Donald Trump. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=85.96s)]
*  They want him to be the guy in whose hands all this power is concentrated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  But they say they would plan to do this with any Republican president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=94.8s)]
*  The plan is to change the structure of the U.S. government so the next president, the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  next Republican president, will take direct control of all state power. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  He would, for example, take over all federal law enforcement and run that directly for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=108.24s)]
*  his own benefit through the DOJ. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=113.36s)]
*  There would be no more independence of federal law enforcement. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=115.28s)]
*  The next president would take control of private business in this country for his own benefit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=119.08s)]
*  through the powers of the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  The next president would revive an old and, I should say, illegal practice called impoundment, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=127.8s)]
*  which would basically take away the fundamental powers of Congress and put that power, too, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=134.12s)]
*  in Trump's hands. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=139.4s)]
*  Again, identify the pockets of independence and seize them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=141.28s)]
*  So instead of checks and balances and limited government, we'd have more of a strongman [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=146.12s)]
*  system of government. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=150.68s)]
*  We'd have a single leader with all the power of the state personally arrogated to him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=151.68s)]
*  No other part of the government, no other thing in the country at all, would be allowed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=158.28s)]
*  to constrain him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  That sounds nice. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=164.76s)]
*  It at least sounds simple. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=165.76s)]
*  That said, it is obviously fundamentally opposite to the whole idea of why we exist as a country [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's no surprise to see an article like this, to see reporting like this in The [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  Times today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  I think everybody sort of knows that this is where the American political right, where [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  the Republican Party has been heading in the Trump era. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  But still, I think the reason this reporting today is getting so much attention and causing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  so much consternation is because, you know, however much this might be the dream of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump era right wing in American politics, for the most part, the American people really [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=205.0s)]
*  don't want this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  And so it's one thing to like sort of see it hinted at or to feel like this is the kind [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=212.82s)]
*  of system they'd like to replace our system with. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=216.88s)]
*  It's another thing to see it in black letter print, right, to find out that they've put [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=218.88s)]
*  a name on it, that it's a project that has an implementation date and they're getting [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=225.8s)]
*  it ready. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  In general, by and large, the American people don't want to live under a single leader who [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=231.88s)]
*  has concentrated all power in his own hands and nothing constrains him and nothing else [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  matters other than his own whims and preferences and grudges. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=241.08s)]
*  You don't want to live in a country under a leader like that who's a good guy, let alone [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=244.82s)]
*  a leader like that who's a bad guy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=250.26s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to be a civics dork to know that you don't want that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=252.42s)]
*  And I think by and large, the American people really don't. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3ct0gyh-k&t=257.46s)]
