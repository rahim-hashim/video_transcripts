**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s)
*  This is video out of Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv today the mayor of Kharkiv [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=0.0s)]
*  Kharkiv said that more than 600 buildings have been destroyed since the Russian invasion began and that the near constant [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=5.44s)]
*  Russian shelling and airstrikes have hit hospitals and government buildings and have completely destroyed 48 schools [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=12.76s)]
*  Yesterday alone the Ukrainian government counted 65 instances of Russian shelling in the city [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=21.04s)]
*  But the people of Kharkiv are amazingly resilient. I want you to see this video that was shot yesterday in Kharkiv [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=26.72s)]
*  Take on me, let the day take me home [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=56.72s)]
*  That of course was take on me by the Norwegian 80s synth pop group Aha [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Performed entirely with traditional Ukrainian instruments in a basement in Kharkiv [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=74.56s)]
*  Ten people and a cat are sheltering from the near constant Russian shelling in that basement [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=80.5s)]
*  But rather than just hiding this band [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=85.86s)]
*  Salo and looty has been putting on concerts and streaming them live on Facebook using joy and music as an act of resistance [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=88.38s)]
*  This is the bandleader Alexander gonna gunsharov's home, which was destroyed by Russian shelling and yet he plays on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=97.62s)]
*  Joining us now from that basement in Kharkiv is Alexander gunsharov the bandleader of Cee Lo and looty Alexander [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being with us [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  I have never been in a place where my home has been bombed and I'm not sure how I would react if [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=113.56s)]
*  That had happened to me your reaction is entirely surprising [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=118.72000000000001s)]
*  You have gone somewhere else with your bandmates on a cat and you are continuing to perform [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=122.56s)]
*  And putting smiles on people's faces. Just tell me about how this has all come to be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, it was my first time when my home was bombed so I didn't have such experience either [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=135.24s)]
*  So I like understand your astonishment of that and this is first time I react on such things [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=141.36s)]
*  So but what wasn't new to me? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=148.36s)]
*  well, I [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=152.56s)]
*  Was aware that the war is coming the most the most part of Ukrainian citizens [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=155.36s)]
*  Well when it comes to such a horror people tend to do to stay that in denial and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Since the war is going on for more than eight years in Ukraine started in 2014 [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=169.84s)]
*  Well [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=177.84s)]
*  many people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=179.36s)]
*  Wouldn't just notice that because well, it was somewhere somewhere to the east some small part of Ukraine only was occupied so [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=180.36s)]
*  It's like I was a little bit prepared for that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=188.12s)]
*  And when we were looking at some would argue that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=191.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I I was gonna say some might not some might say that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=197.16s)]
*  Playing concerts in a war is is denial, but it's not for you. It's resistance, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=201.76s)]
*  You are you are you are doing something here for the morale of you and your bandmates and the people who listen to your live streams [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I cannot 100% exclude that that I also do have some some of denial but [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=213.36s)]
*  While it's not it's not only denial. Yeah, it's it's about resistance. It's about [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  Well to save the energy the our our energy people's energy to do to give support to share support to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  To stand strong [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=236.96s)]
*  because [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=238.96s)]
*  To stand strong [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=240.8s)]
*  because [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=242.8s)]
*  Well recent streams we were mostly talking not not just playing music [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=244.16s)]
*  like we did before because many people write the words of support and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=249.44s)]
*  They are inspired by the fact that we are life that we are able to play and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=254.32s)]
*  So now the war is not only in our house. It actually touched all the world [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=260.72s)]
*  And I see that all the world is scared and well [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  We've done that before inspiring the soldiers at the frontline [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=270.4s)]
*  during these eight years visiting the soldiers and playing music for them and that is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=275.32s)]
*  the part of my life when I realized that what we do is important because well [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=280.8s)]
*  It wasn't yeah always so I wasn't planning to become a musician. It was a hobby [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=285.84s)]
*  but then when you see some things happen and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  You you understand that that's something important and that's something that you can share with [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=295.12s)]
*  It's hard to smile in times like this but watching your video brought a smile to my face [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=302.56s)]
*  Glad to hear that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=311.32s)]
*  Well, I've been Budapest but but I will continue to listen to your your streams [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSSwPoV55s&t=315.08s)]
