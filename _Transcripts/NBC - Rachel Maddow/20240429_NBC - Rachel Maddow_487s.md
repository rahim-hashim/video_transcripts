# Maddow: GOP bears Big Lie's deep scars as Trump dances to avoid accountability
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI)
*  There's a lot going on in the Republican Party right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=0.0s)]
*  And I know that the party's presidential nominee, their most recent former president, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump, I know he sucks up all the oxygen in the room, and for obvious reason, he gets [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=10.48s)]
*  all the coverage, he gets all the commentary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=14.52s)]
*  But note what is going on in the Republican Party in the Trump era apart from him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=16.76s)]
*  I mean, just look at Arizona for a second. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=21.68s)]
*  In Arizona, they are not only running Carrie Lake for Senate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=25.52s)]
*  This weekend, Arizona Republicans just chose their state's representatives to the National [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=30.42s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=35.64s)]
*  You know, it's called the RNC, the Republican National Committee. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=36.64s)]
*  It is actually a committee. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Every state sends two people to be part of the committee that makes up the RNC, that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  makes up the National Republican Party. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=46.8s)]
*  Every state gets two choices. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=48.72s)]
*  This weekend, Arizona Republicans picked their two choices. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=50.44s)]
*  They decided their two choices would be this person, who was literally expelled from the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=53.46s)]
*  state legislature recently after only being there for about three months. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=59.94s)]
*  Here's how that was described in the Arizona Republic. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=64.66s)]
*  Quote, she was expelled from the Republican controlled house just three months into her [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  term. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=71.62s)]
*  This after she staged an all day live streamed legislative hearing at which her witnesses [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=72.62s)]
*  talked about the many ways in which our elections were supposedly stolen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=76.9s)]
*  The highlight was a Scottsdale insurance agent who slimed dozens of public officials and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=81.38s)]
*  private citizens, making preposterous evidence free accusations that they all accepted bribes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=85.61999999999999s)]
*  from the Sinaloa drug cartel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=91.42s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee unanimously concluded that the state legislator not only knew what [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  that insurance agent was likely to say during that hearing, but that the legislator actually [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  took steps to hide the details from House leadership. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=104.78s)]
*  When she lied about it to the ethics panel, now she's a top ranking official in the Republican [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=109.38s)]
*  Party. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=115.5s)]
*  She's one of Arizona's two representatives to the Republican National Committee, chosen [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=116.5s)]
*  this weekend by the Arizona Republican Party. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  But they remember they get to pick two. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=123.94s)]
*  The second representative Arizona Republicans just chose to represent their state at the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=125.5s)]
*  RNC is this person, who was a very special variety of Arizona Republican state senator. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  As far as how Lori Roberts at the Arizona Republic describes him today, quote, meet [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=137.02s)]
*  Jake Hoffman, Arizona's new Republican National Committee man. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=141.66000000000003s)]
*  This Queen Creek Republican burst into public view in 2020 when he ran an internet troll [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=145.66000000000003s)]
*  farm paying teenagers to post conservative talking points and baseless conspiracy theories [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=151.02s)]
*  on social media, all aimed at getting then President Donald Trump reelected. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=157.82000000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post in September 2020 exposed Hoffman's Rally Forge, a digital marketing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=162.98s)]
*  firm where his job was to pay teenagers, some of the minors, to set up fake personas and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=169.38s)]
*  blanket social media with thousands of nearly identical posts aimed at undermining confidence [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=176.04s)]
*  in the validity of the election and downplaying the impact of COVID-19. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=180.62s)]
*  In other words, Jake Hoffman wanted to fool you into thinking these were real people spontaneously [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=185.94s)]
*  expressing deeply held conservative beliefs instead of what they were. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=190.22s)]
*  A group of kids he was paying to deceive you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  The Post cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in ballots and said that Joe Biden is, quote, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=198.18s)]
*  being controlled by behind the scenes individuals who want to take America down the dangerous [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=203.14s)]
*  path toward socialism. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=208.3s)]
*  Quote, it's the kind of thing you might expect to come out of Russia. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=210.42s)]
*  Instead, it came out of Phoenix. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=215.06s)]
*  Or more specifically, Jake Hoffman's secret cell of paid teenage trolls. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=217.82s)]
*  That troll farm in Phoenix was exposed in September of 2020. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=226.5s)]
*  The same gentleman went on in December of 2020 to be one of the fake electors from Arizona [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=230.94s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=237.98s)]
*  He in fact is one of the fake electors who was just criminally indicted in Arizona for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=239.54s)]
*  his alleged role in that scheme. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=244.04s)]
*  So he was indicted last week and named Republican National Committee man for the state of Arizona [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  just days later. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=251.78s)]
*  So it's not like they didn't know he'd been indicted. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=252.78s)]
*  They knew he was indicted, then they picked him afterwards. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=255.78s)]
*  There are at least 53 people who have now been criminally charged with participating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=261.54s)]
*  in the effort to keep Trump in power after he lost reelection in 2020. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  And I'm not talking about the people who physically attacked Congress to try to intimidate and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=271.74s)]
*  physically stop Congress from certifying the vote count on January 6th. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=276.62s)]
*  I mean, you can hive all of those hundreds of people off. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=280.22s)]
*  There are still at least 53 Republican Party officials and lawyers and activists who are [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=283.26s)]
*  facing felony criminal counts other than Donald Trump himself. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=290.14s)]
*  And this is sort of this is me making my case to you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=297.42s)]
*  I think it is an underappreciated part of the politics of the Republican Party in the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=300.86s)]
*  Trump era. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  I think it is an underappreciated part of politics in our country right now as Trump [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  is trying to return to the presidency again. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=311.94s)]
*  That not only is he in the dock facing felony criminal charges as he tries to return to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  the White House, but also in the dock are the chair or former chair of the state Republican [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=319.86s)]
*  parties in Arizona and Michigan and Georgia and Nevada and serving Republican elected [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=327.42s)]
*  officials in all of those states and their all swing states. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  Trump adviser Peter Navarro is in jail right now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=341.18s)]
*  Today, the U.S. Supreme Court again rejected another request from him to get out of prison. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=345.1s)]
*  He is currently serving time in prison for refusing to testify about his role in Trump's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=349.54s)]
*  efforts to overthrow the government. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=354.74s)]
*  Trump attorney Jeff Clark just learned today that in his disbarment proceedings in California, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  the Disciplinary Council for the State Bar Association is arguing to the court that there [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  is no sanction other than disbarment that is suitable for Jeff Clark, given what he [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  did. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=370.98s)]
*  Quote, It would be inconsistent with our duty to the disciplinary system and to the profession [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=371.98s)]
*  to even suggest that a sanction other than disbarment should be contemplated. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=376.42s)]
*  By attempting to violate the rules of professional conduct, Jeff Clark, quote, betrayed those [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=381.38s)]
*  oaths and in doing so his country, lawyers who betray their country must be disbarred. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  And I know that the former president himself, former president and Republican presidential [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=395.5s)]
*  I know him, him being on trial for multiple felonies is an amazing and unprecedented and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=401.9s)]
*  frankly astonishing spectacle. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=407.78s)]
*  But stick a pin in that idea of astonishing, right? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=410.58s)]
*  Because the crime he is alleged to have quarterbacked to try to keep himself in power despite losing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  reelection, that crime is now a sprawling nationwide scandal that has resulted in dozens [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  of Republican officials almost in almost all the swing states being criminally charged [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=427.86s)]
*  and in all of the prominent lawyers involved in that effort, either being criminally charged [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=433.3s)]
*  or having their law licenses put at risk or both. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=437.66s)]
*  And yes, Trump himself will be back in court tomorrow. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=441.82s)]
*  And there's stuff to know about that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=444.3s)]
*  We're going to we're going to get to that tonight. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=446.06s)]
*  But no matter what happens to him in his own felony cases and in his own political trajectory, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=449.5s)]
*  do not lose sight of what is happening to the Republican Party while they have been [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=454.94s)]
*  drafting off him in the lead. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=459.32s)]
*  Because it is an astonishing story on its own. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cGTZ1ZKiAI&t=462.86s)]
