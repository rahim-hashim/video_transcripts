# Anticipating Repression Under Putin, Ukrainians Fight For Their Lives
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE)
*  And in Mariupol tonight in southeastern Ukraine, we have our friend Richard Engel, NBC's chief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=0.0s)]
*  foreign correspondent, who is live in the middle of the night in a part of that country [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=4.8s)]
*  that has just been besieged today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=9.08s)]
*  Richard, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=11.6s)]
*  Again, I know it is the middle of the night where you are. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Tell us about what the day has been like. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=16.96s)]
*  Tell us about what you've been seeing tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=18.2s)]
*  So, this is a difficult day because we are now seeing the Russian army moving on the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=20.36s)]
*  capital, trying to take Ukraine in one foul swoop. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=29.28s)]
*  They hope that by knocking out the capital, knocking out Zelensky, that they can install [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=34.0s)]
*  a puppet regime and win the whole country and then enact a campaign of repression. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=39.76s)]
*  And I've been speaking with intelligence officials, I've been speaking with locals here, with [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=46.96s)]
*  local commanders. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=51.72s)]
*  And the reason they're fighting so hard, and they are fighting hard, is because they know [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=53.16s)]
*  what is at stake if they lose. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=57.98s)]
*  They not only lose their democracy, but they completely anticipate that there will be a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=60.54s)]
*  campaign of repression carried out against them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=65.66s)]
*  And U.S. officials have been warning about this, and U.S. officials have said that they've [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=68.9s)]
*  drawn up kill lists, and Ukrainians believe them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=72.94s)]
*  They believe that what would be, what would follow a loss of this country to Vladimir [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=77.38s)]
*  Putin would be a campaign of human rights abuses and war crimes potentially carried [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=84.42s)]
*  out by a force called the Rosgardia. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=89.86s)]
*  And they are, I've been told, the ones to watch out for, that they will be the ones [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=91.94s)]
*  enforcing a crackdown and trying to, quote, pacify the population. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=97.62s)]
*  So if they don't hold out, they know that they could lose everything. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=104.1s)]
*  Richard, we did hear from the Pentagon today that as far as U.S. intelligence knows about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  Russia's own expectations for this incursion, they're behind schedule. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=116.26s)]
*  They haven't been going as fast as they intended to go or that they expected to go. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=121.3s)]
*  We also had confirmation from the Pentagon today that it doesn't seem like there's anywhere [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=126.18s)]
*  in the country that Russian forces, any city, any population center in the nation of Ukraine [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=129.86s)]
*  where Russian forces are in control, where they're actually holding territory. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=135.14s)]
*  Is this just a matter of pacing or is there any way for us to tell, from your conversations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=139.89999999999998s)]
*  with military leaders and intelligence sources, is there any way to tell whether Russia's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=145.1s)]
*  basically proceeding according to plan or whether they're having more trouble than they expected? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  So they are having more trouble than expected. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=157.5s)]
*  They were slow coming in from the north. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=159.42s)]
*  They had trouble crossing a river when they came down from Belarus. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians have knocked out several bridges also in the north, which has been slowing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=166.5s)]
*  them down. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  They faced some fairly heavy fighting in the south, but the forces were taking their time [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=171.38s)]
*  controlling the canals out of the Crimean Peninsula that controls the flow of water [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=176.9s)]
*  to the peninsula. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=182.98s)]
*  But the biggest factor, which has some Western officials surprised, is that Russia hasn't [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=184.7s)]
*  put all of its forces into this fight yet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=190.7s)]
*  They only have about a third of their forces committed, so they still have a lot of fight [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=193.66s)]
*  left in them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  That only about two-thirds of their force remain on the borders in Russian territory [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=201.78s)]
*  ready to be deployed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=208.66s)]
*  So it's only day two and the Ukrainians have been holding out well and Western officials [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=211.18s)]
*  are impressed with the fighting spirit of Zelensky, but they know that Russia has a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=218.5s)]
*  numerically superior and technologically superior army, which it has largely kept still in Russia, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=226.02s)]
*  but which apparently plans to deploy at some stage and it is unclear why it has not deployed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=233.06s)]
*  the full force yet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=240.34s)]
*  Richard Engel, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  As you say, Richard, this has been a difficult day. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=246.14s)]
*  This is a dark day and a long day ahead for you tomorrow. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=248.62s)]
*  Stay safe, my friend. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtKk4c_b1ZE&t=253.29999999999998s)]
