# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA)
*  Tonight, the Republican convention comes to its conclusion as the Republican [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=0.0s)]
*  Party's presidential nominee gives his acceptance speech. And he is giving this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  acceptance speech. I think it cannot be overstated. He is giving this acceptance [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=8.68s)]
*  speech in truly unique, even bizarre circumstances. I mean, there's no nicer [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  way to say this, but he is a felon recently convicted of 34 felony criminal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=20.76s)]
*  charges now awaiting sentencing for those charges facing up to four years in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=26.7s)]
*  prison. He's also under indictment in other jurisdictions, not only a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  multi count Rico criminal indictment under Georgia state law, but also a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=35.46s)]
*  multi count federal criminal indictment in D. C. District Court in Washington. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=39.58s)]
*  Happily for the nominee, but just adding to the weirdness of it for all the rest [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  of us at this moment, he is no longer facing multiple additional felony [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=49.7s)]
*  federal charges in florida under the Espionage Act. But that's only thanks to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=55.82s)]
*  a shock ruling from a judge he appointed in his last days in office. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=60.74s)]
*  That shock ruling is now being appealed, which means if the appeal by prosecutors [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=65.14s)]
*  is successful, we might expect that the nominee will end up federally indicted [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=70.24s)]
*  under the Espionage Act again. In addition to the other charges he is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=74.9s)]
*  still facing the Espionage Act charges, of course, relate to bizarre revelations [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=79.64s)]
*  about him hoarding and hiding hundreds of classified documents, including very [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=85.74s)]
*  classified documents at his home in florida after his presidency. Even after [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  federal authorities let him know that he had these documents when he should not [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=96.41999999999999s)]
*  have, and he needed to give them back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=99.86s)]
*  The charges of which he was already convicted in New York derived from him [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=103.34s)]
*  using the family business he inherited from his father to cover up payments he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=107.34s)]
*  made to a woman named Stormy Daniels to try to stop her from speaking publicly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=113.34s)]
*  before the 2016 election about an unpleasant sexual encounter. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=117.98s)]
*  She says she endured with Mr. Trump about a year after he married the former [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=122.94s)]
*  first lady, Melania Trump, and not long after she gave birth to their son. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=128.26s)]
*  Although Mr. Trump denied that that alleged sexual encounter took place, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=133.38s)]
*  Mrs. Trump, Melania Trump, was conspicuously absent from that trial. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=138.1s)]
*  Even when the jury delivered its verdict that he was guilty on all 34 felony [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=142.46s)]
*  counts, Mrs. Trump has still been even more conspicuously absent from every one [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=146.66s)]
*  of his campaign trail events this entire year and almost all his other events as [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=152.3s)]
*  well since he left the White House, which is not a typical president and first lady [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=156.9s)]
*  arrangement, which of course is fine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=162.86s)]
*  Who among us knows what makes anyone else's marriage? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=165.74s)]
*  Love is a many splendored thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=169.5s)]
*  But that record of her, did you say? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=172.22s)]
*  I want everybody to know. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=186.54s)]
*  I can also hear you through the television. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=188.7s)]
*  So be on your best behavior. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=192.34s)]
*  The record of Melania Trump avoiding being seen with her husband ever [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  for years at a time now does make it notable that we're about to see something [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=201.5s)]
*  very unusual. We are about to see within the next few minutes that she is in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=205.66s)]
*  Milwaukee tonight, that she is in the building at the Republican Convention for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=210.34s)]
*  Donald Trump's acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=214.17999999999998s)]
*  evening. That itself, a notable and unusual circumstance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  When Donald Trump left the presidency in January 2021, he did not attend the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=222.14s)]
*  inauguration of his successor, that itself unique in American history. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=227.66s)]
*  Trump left in his wake the worst incidents of political violence the country [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=232.54s)]
*  has ever seen in a presidential transition. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  The only time we haven't had a peaceful transition of power from one president to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=240.3s)]
*  the next, arguably ever, arguably since the Civil War. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=244.34s)]
*  The criminal charges that are still pending against the Republicans presidential [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=248.78s)]
*  nominee, the ones in Georgia and Washington, they relate to his refusal to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  leave office after he was voted out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=257.38s)]
*  They relate to the violent coup attempt that he launched, the mob of his [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=258.94s)]
*  supporters that tried to physically stop Congress from certifying the results of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  the election in which he was voted out of office. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=267.38s)]
*  That election, I remind you, was not close. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump lost his reelection bid by more than seven million votes and by more [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  than 70 electoral votes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=279.5s)]
*  And that electoral failure is emblematic of his performance as the Republican [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=282.74s)]
*  Party's leader. Yes, he did get elected to the presidency in 2016, but then under [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=287.66s)]
*  his leadership, the Republican Party lost the House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=292.7s)]
*  The Republican Party lost the Senate. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  The Republican Party lost the White House when he as president really was voted out [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  of office resoundingly after just one term, leaving the country in the grips of a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=303.38s)]
*  crippling covid pandemic, which would go on to kill more than a million [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=307.98s)]
*  Americans, mitigated only by the advent of effective vaccines, which he mostly [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=312.26s)]
*  now denigrates and disavows. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=317.3s)]
*  He also left the country with his Supreme Court, onto which he installed three new [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=319.74s)]
*  hardline ultra conservative justices who, true to his promise, soon overturned [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=324.7s)]
*  Roe versus Wade, throwing women's rights in this country into a very, very fast [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=330.94s)]
*  reverse gear, ushering in draconian abortion bans in Republican controlled states [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=337.3s)]
*  across the country, leading quickly thereafter to Republican led efforts to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=343.26s)]
*  ban in vitro fertilization, to even ban and restrict birth control, leading [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=348.26s)]
*  Republicans in Washington and in the most influential conservative advocacy groups [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  to start their plans for a national abortion ban, for birth control [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=358.9s)]
*  restrictions, for even things like a ban on pornography, a ban on no fault divorce. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=362.82s)]
*  It is a wild record on which to try to build a return to power. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=369.61999999999995s)]
*  But here we are. They are nominating a felon, one who left office in a storm of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  violence that, among other things, injured dozens of police officers, violence for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=381.14s)]
*  which hundreds of his supporters have pled guilty or been convicted of serious [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=386.78s)]
*  crimes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=391.38s)]
*  We put criminals where they belong in jail. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=393.5s)]
*  Cops are good. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=397.85999999999996s)]
*  Criminals are bad. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=398.78s)]
*  Donald Trump stands with the people and the police, our men and women in blue, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=399.7s)]
*  not with the criminals and the rioters. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=406.41999999999996s)]
*  It has made for a very awkward Republican national convention because he [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=409.14s)]
*  literally does stand with the rioters, promising that he will spring them all [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  from prison, calling them martyrs and political prisoners, saying they've just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=417.62s)]
*  been unjustly persecuted and they did nothing wrong. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=424.14s)]
*  After this is how he left office, after a ransacked Capitol was left in the wake [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=430.38s)]
*  of the mob of his supporters that he sent to Congress to try to physically use [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=436.06s)]
*  force to keep him in power. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=440.3s)]
*  It did not seem at the time like it would ever be an open question as to whether [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=441.74s)]
*  America would try to see this as good. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=446.42s)]
*  I think that was a great try and we're sure glad they did that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=451.06s)]
*  Boy, we wish these people had done more of it, that they'd gotten their way. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  These people tasering and bear spraying police officers and smashing their way, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  literally smashing their way onto the floor of Congress. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=465.26s)]
*  And rifling through senators desks and taking what they wanted. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=468.74s)]
*  And ransacking the speaker's office. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  It did not seem at the time like we had any lack of clarity as a country as to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=477.94s)]
*  whether or not it would be a good thing or a bad thing for our country if this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=484.1s)]
*  guy with the paramilitary gear and the zip ties to tie people up, would be [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  to tie people up. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=496.46s)]
*  It did not seem like we had any lack of clarity in considering whether it would [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=498.3s)]
*  be a good thing if this guy had gotten his hands on the members of Congress he [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=503.18s)]
*  was hunting for. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=508.38s)]
*  And what was he going to do with those zip ties? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=509.62s)]
*  And what if it had been the vice president? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=512.34s)]
*  But that's where we are. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=516.54s)]
*  Tonight with the Republican Party almost by acclamation nominating the man who [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=517.38s)]
*  used that violence to try to stay in power, nominating him to once again become [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=523.74s)]
*  president. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=529.14s)]
*  Only this time they have picked him a running mate who says that you wouldn't [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=530.62s)]
*  have had to threaten to hang him to try to get him to go along with the coup. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=534.22s)]
*  Ohio Senator J.D. Vance was picked for the job after he said publicly on [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=539.1s)]
*  television that had he been the vice president when this happened, he would [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=543.4200000000001s)]
*  have done it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=547.14s)]
*  He would have got along with it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=548.14s)]
*  He would have thrown out the results of the election. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  And so it's only been three and a half years and 88 felony counts against [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=554.5s)]
*  Donald Trump since then. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=560.94s)]
*  But the Republican Party is back offering more of this, please. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  This is R.N.C. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=568.3s)]
*  This Republican National Convention saw one of Trump's former advisors take a [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=569.06s)]
*  plane to the convention direct from prison. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=572.9s)]
*  Unlike many other Trump advisors, he was not in jail on on on fraud or [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=576.62s)]
*  corruption charges. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  He was in jail after he took credit for helping to conceive of and to try to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=582.5799999999999s)]
*  implement the plan to stop the certification of the election results. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=588.26s)]
*  Peter Navarro took credit for conceiving and trying to implement that plan. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=592.46s)]
*  And then he refused a subpoena to testify about it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=597.14s)]
*  And so that's why he had to come to the R.N.C. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=600.18s)]
*  from prison, whereupon he received the largest hero's welcome that any of the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=602.3s)]
*  speakers or guests have received on any of the events that happened in the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=608.06s)]
*  election. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=612.34s)]
*  And so he was in jail for that. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  And so he was in jail for that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=614.46s)]
*  And so he was in jail for that. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=616.06s)]
*  And so he was in jail for that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=617.66s)]
*  And so that's why he had to come to the R.N.C. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=619.66s)]
*  from prison, whereupon he received the largest hero's welcome that any of the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=621.66s)]
*  speakers or guests have received on any of the nights of the convention this [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=626.06s)]
*  week. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=630.86s)]
*  But he was just one of the figures who faced criminal charges related to the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=632.54s)]
*  coup, who was celebrated at the convention this week, the fake Trump [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=635.58s)]
*  electors from Nevada. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=638.9399999999999s)]
*  They recently just recently had the charges against them dropped on [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=640.58s)]
*  jurisdictional technical grounds. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  Some of them are delegates to this convention. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=645.4599999999999s)]
*  So are some of the fake electors from Arizona. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=647.5s)]
*  They are under criminal felony indictment. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  They are also now delegates to this Republican National Convention. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=652.42s)]
*  In fact, all seven states that participated in the fake electors scheme [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=655.78s)]
*  as part of the coup to try to keep Trump in power after he was voted out, all [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=660.14s)]
*  seven states, Republican parties in all seven of those states have sent at least [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=664.2199999999999s)]
*  one of their fake electors to be a delegate at this Republican National [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=668.86s)]
*  Convention. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=672.3399999999999s)]
*  And that is just the flavor of it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=673.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=676.9s)]
*  Two of the former president's other advisors whom he pardoned after they were [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=677.6999999999999s)]
*  convicted of federal crimes and sentenced to prison. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=682.1s)]
*  Two of them, you see them here, spotted this week on the RNC floor in Milwaukee, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=684.3s)]
*  mobbed by fans, greeted warmly. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=688.9s)]
*  And we have been slowly boiling in this water. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=692.6999999999999s)]
*  We have been slowly boiling in this reality for long enough that it is [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=699.7s)]
*  possible to lose sight of just how radical this moment actually is. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=705.3000000000001s)]
*  But Republicans really are going to nominate a felon who tried to overthrow [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=708.7s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=714.5s)]
*  government by force. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=714.9000000000001s)]
*  Despite all the people who have gone to prison for it, they have decided that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=715.9000000000001s)]
*  force was justified and that they in no way, shape or form are suggesting that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=719.7s)]
*  they won't do it again. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=728.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=728.7s)]
*  To the country, it is the plan. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=729.7s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party is this time planning overtly in advance that [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  there is not going to be a normal certification of the election this year. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=736.9000000000001s)]
*  They have laid the groundwork already and are implementing efforts already to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=740.3000000000001s)]
*  have Republican County and state officials refuse to certify election [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=744.3000000000001s)]
*  results from the get-go. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=748.7s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=749.9000000000001s)]
*  The consequence of that is that there will not be state certified election [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=752.3000000000001s)]
*  results. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=757.5s)]
*  Sitting there tidily in a box ready to be opened and counted ceremonially on [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=757.9s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=763.1s)]
*  There won't be state certified election results. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=763.9s)]
*  So there can't be just a count of which states were won by each candidate, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=766.5s)]
*  which is how we're supposed to elect presidents in this country. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=770.1s)]
*  As the New York Times put it recently, quote, the strategy involves an [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=772.9s)]
*  ambitious and legally dubious attempt to reimagine decades of settled law [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=776.1s)]
*  dictating how results are officially certified in the weeks before the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=780.3s)]
*  transfer of power. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=784.3s)]
*  I mean, here's where we are. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=786.1s)]
*  The first time the Republican Party chose Donald Trump as their nominee [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=787.1s)]
*  for president, he won the presidential election. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=790.7s)]
*  His presidency is viewed by historians as the worst presidency in the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=793.7s)]
*  history of the United States. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=798.1s)]
*  He was impeached twice. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=800.1s)]
*  The second time they chose him as their party's nominee for president, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=802.9s)]
*  he lost the general election and it ended in a violent failed effort to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=807.1s)]
*  retain power by force. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=812.1s)]
*  Now they are choosing him again with whatever you call the opposite of [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=813.1s)]
*  regret for how it worked out the last time and with an all but explicit [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=818.1s)]
*  promise to do it again. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=823.1s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=824.1s)]
*  Next round starts tonight. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=827.1s)]
*  With everything else that's been going on this week, one story that we keep [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=830.1s)]
*  talking about that we keep coming back to is the lead story in the New York [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=835.1s)]
*  Times on Saturday night before that tragic shooting at a Trump rally in [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=839.1s)]
*  Pennsylvania that wounded the former president was this. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=844.1s)]
*  Unbowed by January 6th charges, Republicans pursue plans to contest a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=848.1s)]
*  Trump defeat, written among other things by among other reporters by Jim [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=853.1s)]
*  Rutenberg at the New York Times. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=858.1s)]
*  The Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=860.1s)]
*  unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=863.1s)]
*  their wide ranging and methodical effort is laying the groundwork to contest [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=866.1s)]
*  the next election, including by attempting to short circuit the process [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=871.1s)]
*  of ratifying the winner. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=875.1s)]
*  Again, this is not a backward looking article about what Trump and his allies [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=877.1s)]
*  did in 2020. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=882.1s)]
*  This is about what they are planning on doing this year. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=883.1s)]
*  Again, this story co-bylined by our next guest, Jim Rutenberg, writer at [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=886.1s)]
*  large for the New York Times. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=891.1s)]
*  Mr. Rutenberg, thanks very much for joining us. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=893.1s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=895.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=897.1s)]
*  Is the sort of scheme that you outline in your article here, is it a rerun of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=899.1s)]
*  what happened in January 2020 or is it the kind of thing, the kind of way you [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=905.1s)]
*  would rerun something if you could go back and do it all better so this time it [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=910.1s)]
*  would work? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=914.1s)]
*  It's more the latter for sure. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=915.1s)]
*  At the end of the day, what they tried to do in 2020 didn't work. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=917.1s)]
*  I just want to say a lot of legal experts believe this won't work either, but [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=922.1s)]
*  what we do know is that there's a lot going on across this country to look at [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=928.1s)]
*  that certification process and change it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=933.1s)]
*  If your viewers will remember, and you did this in your lead up, that the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=936.1s)]
*  certification process is exactly what was being dealt with at Capitol Hill on [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=941.1s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=946.1s)]
*  The pageantry of democracy, that act of certifying an election, it's ministerial. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=947.1s)]
*  There are no two ways about it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=953.1s)]
*  You vote to do it and there's a move afoot already in 20 different counties. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=955.1s)]
*  We've seen this where local boards are voting against certifying. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=960.1s)]
*  It's yet to lead to a big cataclysmic stopping of a certification, but it's come [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=965.1s)]
*  closer than we've ever seen. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=970.1s)]
*  It's unprecedented. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=971.1s)]
*  Tell us about how that might work. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=972.1s)]
*  Let's say, as you outline in your piece, a county in Nevada, say, where this has [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=975.1s)]
*  happened, has local Republican officials who are true believers in this cause and [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=980.1s)]
*  who are sort of in on this plan, and they decide, regardless of what's actually [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=985.1s)]
*  happened locally in that election, that they are going to refuse to certify the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=989.1s)]
*  results in their county. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=993.1s)]
*  What is the knock-on effect of that that could ultimately have national [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=995.1s)]
*  consequences? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=999.1s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you're right. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1000.1s)]
*  I mean, this just did happen in Washoe County, Nevada. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1002.1s)]
*  It only resolved itself a couple of days ago. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1005.1s)]
*  This time around, the results were certified. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1008.1s)]
*  A judge came and a judge was basically court papers were filed threatening legal [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1011.1s)]
*  action to force this board to certify. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1016.1s)]
*  It was plain landed safely. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1018.1s)]
*  The concern is what happens when this is in the fall. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1019.1s)]
*  And we're up against deadlines. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1023.1s)]
*  There are deadlines about certification. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1024.1s)]
*  It's very clearly laid out when the electoral college votes went and then we're [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1026.1s)]
*  right into January 6. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1030.1s)]
*  If one of these counties chooses not to meet that deadline for certification, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1031.1s)]
*  it's very unclear in the law. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1035.1s)]
*  And as your viewers probably remember, this law was rewritten to firm things up, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1037.1s)]
*  to make it harder to short-circuit an election. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1041.1s)]
*  But there are some loopholes. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1044.1s)]
*  There are some new wrinkles, including some harder deadlines. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1045.1s)]
*  And we don't know what happens if you miss those deadlines. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1047.1s)]
*  There's a lot of fear in the advocate community that that could lead to the whole [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1049.1s)]
*  thing getting thrown to Congress. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1054.1s)]
*  But really, who knows? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1056.1s)]
*  And if you mean to be clear, not to spell it out too bluntly here, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1057.1s)]
*  but if a county comes up with certification, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1061.1s)]
*  refuses a court order or ties it up in litigation, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1064.1s)]
*  misses that deadline, then conceivably a state misses its deadline to certify its [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1067.1s)]
*  election results because they can't get certified results from every one of their [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1072.1s)]
*  counties. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1076.1s)]
*  The way that your piece ends is with an acknowledgement from the co-chair of the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1077.1s)]
*  Republican National Committee refusing to commit when asked whether or not the RNC, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1081.1s)]
*  whether or not the Republican Party is going to try to block certification of the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1087.1s)]
*  results in any states this fall. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1093.1s)]
*  The RNC is essentially refusing to say whether they are joined in this effort, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1095.1s)]
*  raising the prospect that they are. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1100.1s)]
*  If a state doesn't have any certified election results, presumably that means they [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1102.1s)]
*  don't submit an electoral slate and the electoral college can't be tallied. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1108.1s)]
*  That is true that the RNC, the chairman himself, other people there I've spoken to, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1113.1s)]
*  they're sort of at best alighting it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1119.1s)]
*  They're not coming out and saying that we do not believe this should happen. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1122.1s)]
*  And in fact, there are a couple of legal cases where the Republican conservative [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1125.1s)]
*  groups are challenging the whole idea of how it's supposed to work, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1129.1s)]
*  saying that board members should be able to vote their conscience and maybe vote [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1133.1s)]
*  against certification. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1136.1s)]
*  Again, the laws very clearly say you vote for certification. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1138.1s)]
*  It's a ministerial thing. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1142.1s)]
*  So they're trying to redefine it and the RNC is not disavowing it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1143.1s)]
*  Now, look, nobody in this hall today thinks that it's going to require, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1147.1s)]
*  that it's going to be required to do this in the fall, but we all know it's going to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1151.1s)]
*  be often a close election in this country, so we'll see. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1154.1s)]
*  Jim, let me just ask you one last question, outlining this the way that you have. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1157.1s)]
*  Again, one of the things that's interesting here is that it is sort of happening in [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1161.1s)]
*  full view. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1165.1s)]
*  You talk about 20 different jurisdictions at least where low-level Republican [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1166.1s)]
*  officials are already refusing certification, not in places where there's real scandal [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1170.1s)]
*  or worrisome content of the election results, but seemingly because they're just [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1177.1s)]
*  inclined not to certify anymore. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1181.1s)]
*  If we can see this happening and you as a reporter can see this happening, the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1183.1s)]
*  Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party can see this happening, too. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1187.1s)]
*  Are you seeing any evidence of a counter effort or any sort of counteroffensive on [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1190.1s)]
*  the side of the Democrats to try to head this off? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1196.1s)]
*  Yeah, we're told there's a very strong counter effort. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1200.1s)]
*  The Democrats say, again, unprecedented. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1204.1s)]
*  We hate using that word in my newspaper. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1206.1s)]
*  We only use it when it's true, but the Democrats say that there's an unprecedented [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1208.1s)]
*  effort to meet this challenge, to get on the ground in these states, to monitor. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1212.1s)]
*  In fact, that Washoe County board, it's a tiny, it's a commission board that a Democratic [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1216.1s)]
*  group came in to support a Republican on that board who's very traditional Republican who [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1221.1s)]
*  believes in the certification process. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1226.1s)]
*  Interestingly, she ended up voting against her own certification under immense pressure, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1228.1s)]
*  but reversed her vote this week and that's how that went through. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1233.1s)]
*  But the Democrats are all over this and no matter what is going to happen with that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1236.1s)]
*  campaign, their lawyers are engaged in dealing. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1240.1s)]
*  And so are many civil rights lawyers whose goal is not as partisan. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1242.1s)]
*  It's a civil rights issue to them and they're involved as well. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1247.1s)]
*  Well, this shouldn't have to be the way that elections are fought, but this is a very [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1249.1s)]
*  first, early, clear view that this is the way this one's going to be fought. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1254.1s)]
*  It's not just about votes. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1258.1s)]
*  It's about the way elections work or don't. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrlmcC1mJA&t=1259.1s)]
