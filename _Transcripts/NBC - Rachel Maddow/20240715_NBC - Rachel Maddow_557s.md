# 'Noxious': See Maddow expose JD Vance's past statements about Trump, Jan. 6 and more
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI)
*  For the third election in a row, the Republican Party has chosen Donald Trump as their presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=0.0s)]
*  nominee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=5.76s)]
*  And today he chose Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=6.9s)]
*  Mr. Vance has only been in the U.S. Senate for 18 months. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=11.6s)]
*  He's never otherwise held public office at all. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=14.68s)]
*  He wrote a book about white working class despair. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=18.0s)]
*  He worked as a venture capitalist. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=22.32s)]
*  He went to Yale Law School, which is where he met his wife, who works at a high-end law [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  firm in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., or at least she did until today when she quit [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=29.04s)]
*  that firm after her husband was nominated to be Trump's running mate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=33.84s)]
*  Mr. Vance worked as a CNN contributor. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=38.76s)]
*  He was a public affairs officer in Iraq with the United States Marine Corps. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=41.04s)]
*  But as a running mate for Donald Trump, it is unavoidable to note that his record of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=46.56s)]
*  remarks about Trump is one that I think could reasonably described, reasonably be described [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=53.44s)]
*  as rich. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=59.32s)]
*  Maybe that's the word, rich. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=60.32s)]
*  I'm a never Trump guy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=63.64s)]
*  I never liked him. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=65.16s)]
*  It makes you think that at a fundamental level, this is sort of a he said, she said, right. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=66.48s)]
*  And at the end of the day, do you believe Donald Trump, who always tells the truth? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=71.12s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=75.56s)]
*  Or do you believe that woman on that tape? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=76.56s)]
*  I cannot stand Trump because I think he's a fraud. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=77.56s)]
*  Well, I think he's a total fraud that is exploiting these people, who is a total fraud. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Like you said, I agree with you on Trump because I don't think that he's the person I don't [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=85.28s)]
*  think he actually cares about folks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=89.56s)]
*  So as a conservative who thinks that Trump does not have the answers and isn't qualified [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=91.48s)]
*  to be president, what are you going to do this election if you don't mind saying? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  My current plan is to vote either third party or as I joke to my wife, I might write in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  my dog because that's about as good as it seems. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, I think there's a chance if I feel like Trump has a really good chance [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=112.92s)]
*  of winning that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=117.76s)]
*  Ultimately, I think I'll probably vote third party. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=122.12s)]
*  I might vote for this this new guy who I really like, Evan McMullen, who I actually met the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=124.76s)]
*  other day. But but I think that that I'm going to vote for I'm going to vote third party [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=129.84s)]
*  because I can't stomach Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=135.16s)]
*  I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=136.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's new running mate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=143.52s)]
*  I will vote for my dog over him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=144.88000000000002s)]
*  I will vote for a guy I just met, Evan McMullen or Hillary Clinton or some other third [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  party entity I can't even name. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=154.12s)]
*  I will not vote for him because he is noxious and he is leading us in this country to a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=156.56s)]
*  very dark place. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=161.08s)]
*  Calls him a total fraud. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=163.16s)]
*  And in addition to that clip, you saw there of him on MSNBC on hardball with Chris Matthews [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=166.08s)]
*  saying that he believed a woman when she testified in the E. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Jean Carroll case that she was sexually assaulted by Trump. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=173.68s)]
*  He believed her, not not Trump. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  He also liked a tweet around the same time saying that Trump had committed serial sexual [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=180.4s)]
*  assaults. Another one just calling Trump a monster. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=185.36s)]
*  He has called Trump a moral disaster. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=188.72s)]
*  He's called him cultural heroin. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=191.28s)]
*  He has called him reprehensible. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=194.96s)]
*  He has also called him, quote, an idiot. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  J.D. Vance is a very good writer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=200.8s)]
*  He wrote in a very good New York Times op ed that, quote, Trump is unfit for our nation's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  highest office. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  He wrote to one former roommate about Trump, quote, I go back and forth between thinking [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=209.08s)]
*  Trump is a cynical a-hole like Nixon or that he's America's Hitler. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=213.8s)]
*  How's that for discouraging? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  End quote. After this weekend's horrific shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=221.08s)]
*  that assassination attempt against Trump that bloodied the former president, that killed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=228.12s)]
*  a man that wounded two others, J.D. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=233.08s)]
*  Vance, now a U.S. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=235.72000000000003s)]
*  Senator, posted online that it was Democrats criticism of Trump as anti-democratic, that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=236.52s)]
*  in his words, quote, led directly to the assassination attempt against Trump, led [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=241.52s)]
*  directly. Many people, many political observers went on the record this weekend saying that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=247.88s)]
*  if J.D. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=253.36s)]
*  Vance was indeed still on the short list to be considered to be Trump's running mate, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=253.8s)]
*  that online post, that tweet from him this weekend saying that Democrats led directly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=258.32s)]
*  to the assassination attempt against Trump, that surely would have disqualified him from [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=263.52s)]
*  staying on the short list. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=269.72s)]
*  But he says that Democrats criticism of Trump led directly to that assassination attempt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=272.08s)]
*  Despite the fact that he himself called Trump America's Hitler. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=278.32s)]
*  J.D. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=283.96s)]
*  Vance says he has changed, that he no longer thinks all those terrible things that he has [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=284.28s)]
*  said about Trump in the past. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, maybe that's true. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  Who among us knows what is in a man's heart? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=292.64s)]
*  But in J.D. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=295.88s)]
*  Vance's public positions now, there is there's nothing, literally nothing about Trump that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=296.64s)]
*  Vance is not endorsing and indeed advancing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=302.28s)]
*  You may remember J.D. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=306.04s)]
*  Vance coming to Trump's criminal trial in New York. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  He called it a sham trial. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=310.20000000000005s)]
*  And while he was there, he attacked not only the judge in the case, but the judge's family. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  And he made sure to dress exactly like Trump while he did it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=317.48s)]
*  He has decided that he, too, is against windmills, terrible, ugly windmills, he calls them one [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=321.44s)]
*  of the weirdest Trump pet peeves of all. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=327.92s)]
*  J.D. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=330.04s)]
*  Vance has adopted that now for himself as well. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=330.44s)]
*  Justices adopted the red tie, white shirt thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=333.12s)]
*  He calls people convicted for crimes related to the January 6th attack, quote, political [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=341.24s)]
*  He says the 2020 election was not a real election. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=342.24s)]
*  He says he will not commit to accepting the results of the next election in 2024. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=345.2s)]
*  It is, of course, unusual for a president to run for a second term with a different running [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=350.76s)]
*  mate than they had in their first term. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  But clearly, Mike Pence was not no longer available. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=358.08s)]
*  Mike Pence, not an option for Donald Trump this time around. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=361.76s)]
*  After the violent mob Trump unleashed on the Capitol looked for Mike Pence to try to hang [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=364.28s)]
*  him while Trump egged them on. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=369.52s)]
*  Vice President Pence has since made history as saying that he explicitly cannot endorse [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=371.76s)]
*  his former running mate for a second term in office. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=377.4s)]
*  How do you talk yourself into wanting Trump to pick you for this job? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=381.92s)]
*  When the last guy Trump picked for this job, he also nearly got killed when he told an [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  armed violent mob that Pence was the man to blame for all they were so upset about. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=389.32s)]
*  J.D. Vance told CNN this year that he doesn't think that Mike Pence was ever really in any [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=396.68s)]
*  real danger on January 6th. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=401.12s)]
*  He also says that had he been Mike Pence, had he been vice president himself on January [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=404.28s)]
*  26th, excuse me, January 6th, 2021, he would have thrown out the real electoral votes and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=410.08s)]
*  done what Trump wanted. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=415.08s)]
*  The lead story in The New York Times on Saturday night before the terrible shooting happened [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=416.04s)]
*  in Pennsylvania was this story about how Republicans have already laid the groundwork to have their [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  officials all over the country refuse to certify the election results this year. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=429.04s)]
*  Groups like the Heritage Foundation are saying publicly that some sort of amorphous conditions [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  exist in the country now, right now, that already justify any election official at any [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  level refusing to certify the results. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  They're already intending that the election results will not be certified, and that is [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=450.92s)]
*  intended and it may very well prevent any normal count of the vote this year, any normal [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  tally of the votes, including in the Electoral College. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  The idea is that there will just be chaos in Washington. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=464.44s)]
*  There will be a fight, some kind of actual fight for power in Washington instead of it [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=467.24s)]
*  being decided by our votes in the states. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=471.52s)]
*  Well, now, as of tonight, they've got as a running mate for Trump, someone who is who [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=474.92s)]
*  is committed and who is insisting that there was nothing wrong with what happened on January [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7x62HdEULI&t=479.16s)]
