# 'Rapid unscheduled disassembly': Another Musk SpaceX rocket explodes, interrupting air traffic
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY)
*  Hey, turns out tonight Elon Musk blew something up and disrupted the lives of thousands of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=7.74s)]
*  For the second time in less than two months, a rocket launched by Elon Musk's company, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=11.34s)]
*  SpaceX, exploded and rained potentially dangerous debris down over a wide area of Earth, causing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=16.46s)]
*  real chaos for planes and airline passengers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=23.28s)]
*  This was the most recent test of SpaceX's Starship rocket. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=27.94s)]
*  Musk says he wants to use Starship to one day take people to Mars. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=33.06s)]
*  This one lifted off around 6.30 p.m. Eastern from the southern tip of Texas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=37.06s)]
*  In a statement, SpaceX said that, quote, during Starship's ascent burn, the vehicle experienced [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=42.08s)]
*  a rapid unscheduled disassembly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=47.78s)]
*  Rapid unscheduled disassembly is kind of Elon Musk's specialty these days, especially [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=53.68s)]
*  in a way that really messes with other people through no fault of their own. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=58.56s)]
*  As debris rained down tonight from Elon Musk's failed rocket, multiple airports in Florida, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=63.08s)]
*  including Miami and Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach and Orlando, were all brought to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=69.6s)]
*  a complete halt, ground stop at all of those airports. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=74.88s)]
*  Even departures as far north as the Philadelphia airport were significantly delayed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=79.24s)]
*  As I mentioned, this is the second time this has happened in recent weeks. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=85.38s)]
*  SpaceX's last test of the Starship rocket suffered a similar fate in mid-January. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=89.64s)]
*  When that happened, the FAA grounded Starship and has since been overseeing SpaceX's investigation [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=95.16s)]
*  of what went wrong. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=101.22s)]
*  Even though that investigation is still underway, last week the FAA nevertheless cleared SpaceX [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  to launch another one, even though the investigation into why the last one blew up wasn't complete. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=108.22s)]
*  Why'd they clear it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=114.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=115.82s)]
*  But of course, in between those two flights, Donald Trump was sworn in as president. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=116.82s)]
*  He installed Elon Musk, his top campaign donor, as kind of his co-president. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=120.6s)]
*  Musk's doge austerity operation fired hundreds of people at the FAA. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=124.94s)]
*  And the FAA reportedly decided to suddenly start using Starlink satellite terminals made [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=131.02s)]
*  by Musk's company. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=137.38000000000002s)]
*  Speaking of Elon Musk lighting up the night sky, I should also mention that this electronic [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=141.22s)]
*  billboard just went up in Times Square today in Manhattan. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  Fire Elon Musk! [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  He fired 6,000 veterans. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=149.5s)]
*  He wants to cut Medicare. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=151.84s)]
*  Who is running the White House? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=153.36s)]
*  Fire Elon Musk. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=155.74s)]
*  That billboard courtesy of the pro-democracy organization Common Cause and its Fire Musk [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=158.18s)]
*  campaign. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=163.38000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it is worth wondering, at least, how much more rapid, unscheduled disassembly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=164.46s)]
*  our country is going to be able to take. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I822rN6NlWY&t=172.94s)]
