# 'JR-15 for toddlers is a real thing': Illinois fights gun lobby to ban marketing guns to little kids
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg)
*  So we are a big country, 330 million people, very diverse, very heterogeneous in terms [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=0.0s)]
*  of everything, in terms of backgrounds, traditions, the way we live, our values, our opinions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=8.32s)]
*  But for all our diversity, I think that we Americans can all probably agree, I think [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=17.44s)]
*  we can all come together around the somewhat obvious idea that if there is one consumer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=23.6s)]
*  product that America needs, one thing we're just missing as a country, it's probably a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=29.56s)]
*  gun that is specifically designed for babies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  A gun specifically designed to be wielded by babies. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=43.56s)]
*  Specifically an assault rifle style semi-automatic long gun made to look kind of like the civilian [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  version of a U.S. military issue M4 rifle, but sized down. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  So like, toddlers can use them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=58.48s)]
*  Not toy guns, not like super soakers, squirt guns, not BB guns, not cap guns. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Real guns that fire real bullets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=68.2s)]
*  You've heard of the AR-15? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=70.6s)]
*  Well now meet the JR-15, as in the junior AR-15. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  The company that makes it is just super cute about the whole thing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=78.08s)]
*  They call themselves Wee One the Tactical. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=80.96s)]
*  Wee One. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  We won, but Wee One, as in Little One. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=85.04s)]
*  Until recently they had logos for the little girls and little boys version of this gun [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=88.64s)]
*  for babies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  The logos were this little kid's skull and crossbones with a pacifier for boys, and this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=94.4s)]
*  little skull and bones pacifier with a crossbone, with a pacifier for girls. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=99.12s)]
*  Because why should any kid have to wait until they're done with the teething process before [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=106.4s)]
*  they can start carrying their own assault rifle? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=110.4s)]
*  They advertise the JR-15 as smaller, safer, lighter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=114.32s)]
*  They apparently recently did drop the pacifier logos and the Scooby Doo cartoon font in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  some of their advertising. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  But it's not like they're no longer claiming this is an assault rifle for babies. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they could change their marketing of it, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=131.56s)]
*  They could say this is for a different purpose. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  They could have started to say they're making this mini-sized assault rifle for people with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=136.68s)]
*  unusually short arms. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Hey, are you built like a T-Rex? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=142.44s)]
*  Hard time reaching the steering wheel and the pedals at the same time? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  Have Wee got the assault rifle for you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=147.52s)]
*  Or they could market it for people with low upper body strength. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  Can't handle a gun that weighs more than two pounds? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=154.28s)]
*  Find yourself unable to lift a carton of milk anymore? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=156.84s)]
*  Don't worry, doesn't mean you shouldn't have a semi-automatic blowback action assault rifle [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=160.28s)]
*  of your dreams. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=164.44s)]
*  It's specifically designed for you, great-great-grandma. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=165.44s)]
*  When they dropped the pacifier logo explicitly targeting the gun to the teething toddler [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=170.8s)]
*  market, that might have seemed like it was signaling that they were abandoning the whole [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=176.72s)]
*  idea of assault rifles for kids. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  But no, it turns out they just dropped the pacifier logos and the cartoon font, but they're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=184.8s)]
*  making clear that it is not just for people with little tiny arms or not just for people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  with very poor upper body strength. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=195.24s)]
*  It's still definitely for preschool. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=197.56s)]
*  And the reason you can tell that it's still their targeted market for this gun is because [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=201.16s)]
*  this is the image that pops up on the splash page at their website. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=205.72s)]
*  Clear enough? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=213.76s)]
*  Here's another view of the same target consumer. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=216.04s)]
*  Maybe she's, what, five? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  You think she's five? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=221.68s)]
*  But if America is now marketing smaller, later fully functional semi-automatic assault rifles [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=225.34s)]
*  for five-year-olds, I mean, what's next? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=230.22s)]
*  Why would we stop there? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=235.66s)]
*  If they really want to get the full market share that might be available to them, maybe [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=236.66s)]
*  they could do an even littler one that babies could use in the crib. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=239.34s)]
*  Maybe they could like fire it with their feet or something. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=242.66s)]
*  The Junior AR-15, the JR-15 for toddlers, is a real thing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=247.26s)]
*  For its part, the company who makes this kid gun says the reason it's so great for kids [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=255.06s)]
*  is not only because it only weighs two pounds and is sized for little fingers and little [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=260.58s)]
*  arms and little hands, but they're very hot to tell you that it has special safety features. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=266.02s)]
*  The special safety feature appears mostly to be just a second deliberately awkward safety [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=272.06s)]
*  knob on the other side of the gun from the regular safety, because surely kids won't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=276.7s)]
*  be able to figure that one out on their own. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=280.98s)]
*  The website Snopes.com, which debunks fake things in the news and fake things on the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=284.46s)]
*  internet, they had to do a Snopes post not long ago assuring people that, no, this is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=289.65999999999997s)]
*  not a rejected plot line from The Simpsons or from a Borat movie written to dramatize [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=294.34s)]
*  through exaggeration how insane things can get in this country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  No, this is a real thing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  True. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=303.65999999999997s)]
*  Is the JR-15 a real rifle designed for children? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  True. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=307.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=308.78s)]
*  It's in the news today because in the great state of Illinois, where there is a pugnacious [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=309.78s)]
*  Democratic governor named J.B. Pritzker and a Democratic legislature in Illinois, they [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=318.14s)]
*  are about to pass a new law that would ban gun marketing, gun advertising that specifically [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  markets guns to kids. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=329.61999999999995s)]
*  And this is sort of the poster child kid assault rifle for that new law. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=332.52s)]
*  Now, of course, they're not banning the gun itself. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=337.86s)]
*  Heaven forfend. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=341.26s)]
*  We cannot do that in this country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=342.26s)]
*  Just ask the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=343.78s)]
*  But they are at least trying to ban the advertising of these assault rifles for babies. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=345.46s)]
*  California passed a law along the same lines last year. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=351.5s)]
*  Now other blue states, including Illinois, are following suit. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  Gun rights groups and their Republican supporters are absolutely outraged. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=358.9s)]
*  They're absolutely against any such move. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=362.62s)]
*  Why on earth would you want to limit any sort of communication or marketing targeting children [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=365.66s)]
*  with this sort of thing? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, from their perspective, yeah, hey, what could possibly go wrong? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=372.06s)]
*  To this day, people don't believe me when I tell them what it is that Republicans did [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=379.18s)]
*  first the last time they got full control in Washington, the last time they got control [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=385.5s)]
*  of both the White House and the Congress. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=390.62s)]
*  You remember when that was, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=393.42s)]
*  That was the result of the 2016 election. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=394.62s)]
*  And there was so much shock and consternation over what candidate Donald Trump had said [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=397.58s)]
*  he was going to do with the presidency and what he had campaigned on. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=402.22s)]
*  There was so much shock and surprise over the election outcome, particularly at the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  presidential level. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=410.02s)]
*  But the election outcome was that Republicans not only got the White House, they also got [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=411.02s)]
*  the House and the Senate. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=414.3s)]
*  But amid all of the consternation and shock and all of the rapid change that that portended, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=417.3s)]
*  no one remembers what they actually did with that power once they got it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=430.62s)]
*  It is as real as the AR-15 military-style assault rifle sized down for preschoolers. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=431.62s)]
*  The first substantive thing the new Republican Congress did in 2017 when they got full control [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=436.52s)]
*  in Washington was the Republicans passed legislation that would facilitate access to firearms for [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  people who had been formally adjudicated to be mentally ill. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=448.78s)]
*  Not just like people who seem a little off, but like people who were formally adjudicated [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=454.42s)]
*  by the government to be mentally ill and unable to handle their own affairs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=458.7s)]
*  The first thing Republicans did with full power in Washington was literally make it [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=464.1s)]
*  easier for officially crazy people to get guns. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  To this day, people still do not believe it, but look it up. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=474.66s)]
*  It is true. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  And now, naturally, along that same plotline, now we have kid-sized, fully functional semi-automatic [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=479.26s)]
*  military-style assault rifles that fire real bullets. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=486.18s)]
*  California last year and Illinois now are trying at the state level to at least block [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  the marketing of those. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=493.66s)]
*  But the guns exist, and gun groups and their Republican supporters are very much opposed [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=497.1s)]
*  even to trying to regulate the advertising around this new product. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRojUekUYZg&t=502.5s)]
