# DeSantis Proves An Apt Student Of Trump-Style Bully Politics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA)
*  This week, Politico interviewed Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of history and an expert on authoritarianism [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=0.0s)]
*  at New York University. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=4.84s)]
*  She had this to say about the governor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=6.4s)]
*  Quote, DeSantis has autocratic tendencies. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=8.32s)]
*  He has absorbed the lessons of what you need to get ahead in the GOP today, and that is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=11.32s)]
*  to be a forceful bully even to high school students. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=15.96s)]
*  That's one way he's setting up Florida to be the fiefdom of a certain politics, a certain [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=20.32s)]
*  ideology that he clearly then wants to take national. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  End quote. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=28.96s)]
*  Joining me now is Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of history at New York University and author [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=30.04s)]
*  of Strongmen, Mussolini to the President. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=33.6s)]
*  Ruth, it's good to see you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=37.36s)]
*  This is uniquely relevant because to a lot of Americans, Ron DeSantis is the governor [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=38.82s)]
*  of Florida, and it doesn't make any difference to them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=43.04s)]
*  It doesn't matter to them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=45.6s)]
*  But you make the argument that he is setting himself up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=46.72s)]
*  He's watched Donald Trump's relative success and is trying to figure out how to possibly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=49.6s)]
*  even do it better. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=55.96s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=59.12s)]
*  And the lesson is when you have somebody like Trump come into the system, he spawns imitators. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=60.48s)]
*  And Ron DeSantis has absorbed his lessons, even his hand gestures. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=67.08s)]
*  But what's so disturbing is not just the content of what he's doing in Florida with anti critical [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=71.6s)]
*  race theory, anti LGBTQ rights, the whole menu of repressive GOP policies, but his style [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=78.16s)]
*  of leadership, his executive overreach. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=86.0s)]
*  He's involving himself in things that governors never did before, not just redistricting, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=89.36s)]
*  but also appointments to the state Supreme Court. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And as for the measure against Disney, I feel like it's something out of Viktor Orban's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=97.2s)]
*  Hungary because basically he's financially and otherwise punishing and harassing a corporation [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=101.52s)]
*  because it doesn't agree with his ideas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=108.68s)]
*  It's actually contrary to the way Republicans used to see things, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=112.24s)]
*  The idea that you would punish a corporation for not agreeing with your ideas is not a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=116.2s)]
*  traditionally Republican or conservative view. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=120.32s)]
*  No, but the thing with the new breed of Trumpians and DeSantis is the primary one. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=123.64s)]
*  It's about amassing personal power. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=132.44s)]
*  It's about bullying people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=134.84s)]
*  And he got the state legislator to approve his Disney and other things in record time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=136.56s)]
*  And you always have to ask who's going to benefit from this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=142.8s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=145.24s)]
*  And certainly not the people of Florida. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=146.32s)]
*  They're going to have, you know, in that area, they're going to have up to a 25 percent more [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=148.4s)]
*  tax burden. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=153.04s)]
*  And the Reedy Creek district that's now being punished is going to be left with a hundred [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=155.32s)]
*  and sixty four million dollar tax burden and no way to get that revenue. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  So who is benefiting this? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=166.08s)]
*  Just the power of DeSantis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=167.76s)]
*  Let me ask you about this whole concept of framing restrictions on activity, restrictions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=169.88s)]
*  on speech, restrictions on teaching as freedom. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=175.04s)]
*  That's the interesting part. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=177.96s)]
*  Like DeSantis could do everything he's done, except he cloaks it all in I'm giving you [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=178.88s)]
*  greater freedom. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=184.12s)]
*  Yeah, this is very disturbing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=186.84s)]
*  It's actually an old right wing playbook to set yourself up as the liberal democracy is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=188.36s)]
*  tyranny. And you are the advocate of freedom. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=195.24s)]
*  And, you know, if we really look at what he's done is he's clamping down on if you don't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  agree with the science, you know, if you're pro science, you don't agree with this covid [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=203.84s)]
*  policies. He fires you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  And then he points a new surgeon general. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=210.28s)]
*  So he's punitive. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=212.60000000000002s)]
*  And this is the kind of projection. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=214.28s)]
*  But it's a classic right wing tactic to make yourself the bastion of freedom. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=217.4s)]
*  I'm also worried because he's setting himself up to have this kind of regional power base. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  Remember, at the height of the pandemic, he invited, you know, he invited policemen and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=228.32s)]
*  others who didn't want to submit to tyrannical mask mandates to come and be free in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=233.68s)]
*  Florida. So he's setting himself up as the kind of nemesis of federal government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=239.04s)]
*  And that's a very subversive and extremist thing to do in my book. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=245.24s)]
*  Ruth, thanks as always for being with us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=249.12s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giad is a professor of history at the New York University. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=250.96s)]
*  We always appreciate your time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNgrXuSoEA&t=253.76000000000002s)]
