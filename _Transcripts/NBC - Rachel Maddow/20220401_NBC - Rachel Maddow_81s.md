# Ukrainian Schnauzer Found In War Zone Given New Home
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg)
*  Some of the most enduring images of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are of refugees leaving everything behind as they flee war, except their pets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=0.0s)]
*  But this beautiful big black dog was somehow left behind in an abandoned village near Kyiv. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=9.0s)]
*  The dog, a schnauzer named Bavaria, was found by Ukrainian soldiers who were inspecting homes in the village. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=14.0s)]
*  They found him inside a house that had been damaged by shelling. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=21.0s)]
*  What the dog's full backstory is and where his original people are, we may never know, but now he's embarking on a new chapter. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=24.0s)]
*  The soldiers brought the dog into Kyiv and into the arms of a woman named Olga, who volunteers with their regiment. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=32.0s)]
*  She says she's always wanted a big black dog, so she's happy, the dog's happy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=39.0s)]
*  Olga's cat has relocated to the top of the refrigerator. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=44.0s)]
*  Whether this will be Bavaria, the dog's forever home, or whether he's eventually reunited with his original people, for now, this is a happy ending for everyone, except possibly the cat. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=49.0s)]
*  you [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLIR7EyKRZg&t=79.0s)]
