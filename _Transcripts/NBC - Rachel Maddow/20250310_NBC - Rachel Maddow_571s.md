# 'Serious mistakes': Kelly sounds alarm on Trump handling of Ukraine; Nails Musk on 'traitor' gibe
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI)
*  Over the weekend, Arizona U.S. Senator Mark Kelly went to Ukraine, where he met with Ukrainian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=0.0s)]
*  officials and soldiers and ordinary people living with the fallout from Russia's three-year [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=5.8s)]
*  invasion of that country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=10.88s)]
*  After he got home, Senator Kelly posted about his trip on Elon Musk's social media platform, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=12.0s)]
*  Twitter. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=17.76s)]
*  He said, in part, quote, just left Ukraine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=18.76s)]
*  What I saw proved to me that we can't give up on the Ukrainian people. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=21.48s)]
*  Everyone wants this war to end. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=25.32s)]
*  But any agreement has to protect Ukraine's security and can't be a giveaway to Putin. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=26.56s)]
*  Putin is a war criminal who targets hospitals routinely. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=31.04s)]
*  I visited one in Kiev. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=34.64s)]
*  Injured soldiers told me how they wanted to get back to the fight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=36.32s)]
*  Nurses there shared their stories of the invasion with me through tears. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=38.96s)]
*  He said, I met with Ukrainian pilots flying challenging combat missions against the Russians [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=42.68s)]
*  who are protected by a considerable electronic warfare and surface-to-air missile system [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=48.08s)]
*  defense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=52.96s)]
*  When Trump cut off these Ukrainian pilots from U.S. intelligence that they needed to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=54.08s)]
*  plan their missions, he blinded them to the threat and he put them and their aircraft [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=58.16s)]
*  at risk. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=63.04s)]
*  But worse than that, it helps the Russians advance further into Ukrainian territory to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  murder more Ukrainians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  President Trump says the Russians are, quote, hitting them hard in a tone of voice that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=71.08s)]
*  implies approval. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=75.08s)]
*  It is sickening to see from an American president, quote, hitting them hard means more dead Ukrainian [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=76.08s)]
*  kids. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=82.72s)]
*  Senator Kelly says, quote, I visited the wall of remembrance to pay tribute to Ukraine's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=83.72s)]
*  dead soldiers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=87.96s)]
*  I'm bringing back what I saw and learned from Ukrainian leaders, service members and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=88.96s)]
*  the Ukrainian people to show the direct impact our support is having on the ground. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=93.8s)]
*  He says the world will become a very cold and lonely place if we continue this ridiculous [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=97.28s)]
*  screw you, go it alone foreign policy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=101.92s)]
*  It is dumb and it will not age well and it puts you and your kids and your grandkids [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=104.68s)]
*  at risk. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  After Senator Kelly posted that online, he got a response from President Donald Trump's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=112.42s)]
*  top campaign donor. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=119.06s)]
*  Elon Musk said in response to the combat veteran, Navy commander and U.S. astronaut, quote, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=121.18s)]
*  you are a traitor. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=127.98s)]
*  Senator Kelly then responded by saying, traitor? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=131.98s)]
*  Elon, if you don't understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=134.74s)]
*  great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=139.26s)]
*  Joining us now is Arizona, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=145.54s)]
*  Senator, I really appreciate you joining us this evening. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  I know you've had a lot of travel time recently. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=150.54s)]
*  Do you care about the radio? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=152.54s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=155.54s)]
*  Do I gotcha? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=156.54s)]
*  It was. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=158.82s)]
*  Yeah, I can hear you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=159.82s)]
*  OK, I can hear you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=161.26s)]
*  Go ahead, sir. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=162.89999999999998s)]
*  I can hear you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=163.89999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=164.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sorry about that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  I thank you for having me on the show. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  It's a long trip to get there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=168.26s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=169.98s)]
*  It's really important to do it, especially now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=170.98s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe what's going on. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=174.06s)]
*  It seems like our country, well, at least the Oval Office, has switched sides in this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  conflict. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=182.78s)]
*  And to meet with the Ukrainian people, you showed the two nurses on the screen there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=183.82s)]
*  Tatiana and Irina were their names, and their story is just heartbreaking. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=188.54s)]
*  It is so sad. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=194.2s)]
*  You didn't share the part, I think. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=195.94s)]
*  I think it's important to hear what they experienced. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=198.34s)]
*  They watched children that they knew being raped by Russian soldiers in front of their [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=202.3s)]
*  parents and then those kids murdered by those Russian soldiers in front of their parents. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=209.3s)]
*  It was heartbreaking. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=215.5s)]
*  It is horrendous. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  It'll never be forgiven. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  Those soldiers were sent there by Vladimir Putin to destroy this country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=219.3s)]
*  Putin is an existential threat to Ukraine, to Europe, ultimately to us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=225.22s)]
*  Those women come to work every single day and try to take care of these veterans. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=232.18s)]
*  It was one of the saddest things I've seen since I've been in this job. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=236.54s)]
*  And just to think right now where we are. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=242.58s)]
*  They're going into this negotiation in Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=244.5s)]
*  I hope it goes well. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=246.82s)]
*  Nobody wants this to end as much as the Ukrainian people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=248.18s)]
*  Rachel, this has to end in a way where Ukraine has dignity and has their territory back in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=251.84s)]
*  a way where they're stronger. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=259.56s)]
*  And what Donald Trump has done, I mean, he has really set up these negotiations in a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=261.52s)]
*  way that not only make us look weak, but they put Ukraine in a really horrible position. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=266.2s)]
*  In terms of these negotiations, such as they are, that are happening, in terms of the posture [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=274.98s)]
*  of the U.S. towards this conflict, it appears to me from the outside, just as a citizen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=280.08s)]
*  looking at this, that nothing has been asked of Russia and that, to the contrary, everything [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=284.68s)]
*  that Russia might conceivably have asked of the United States, short of U.S. troops bombing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=291.76s)]
*  Ukraine itself, has been offered to Russia without concession by this president. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=296.52s)]
*  I don't know why Marco Rubio personally feels like the right vessel for that, given [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=303.24s)]
*  his previous clear-eyed warnings and criticism about Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=308.72s)]
*  Do you feel like there's anything the United States could do, if it had its wits about [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=314.12s)]
*  it, to try to change some of the way that Trump is interacting already with Russia and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=318.32s)]
*  Ukraine in a way to make it more likely that Ukraine loses this war? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=324.2s)]
*  Well, I could tell you what we shouldn't have done. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  Right at the beginning here of this negotiation, Donald Trump decides to give up Ukrainian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=332.04s)]
*  territory, say that's not an option, they're not going to get everything back, and to say [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=336.52s)]
*  they'll never be a member of NATO. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=341.0s)]
*  That's not the way you go into a negotiation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=342.84s)]
*  And Secretary Rubio said something similar here on his way to Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=345.52s)]
*  You always want to negotiate from a position of strength. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=349.96s)]
*  They're not doing that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=352.84s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=353.84s)]
*  They have not asked anything of the Russians. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=354.84s)]
*  And Putin is a criminal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=356.88s)]
*  He respects, if anything, he respects strength. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=358.64s)]
*  But keep in mind, Rachel, he wants to undermine Western civilization. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=361.88s)]
*  He wants to undermine our country, our democracy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=367.44s)]
*  He wants to take back territory. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=371.0s)]
*  He's talked about that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=372.84s)]
*  He wants Ukraine back. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  Then he's going to go to the Baltics. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  He's going to go to Poland. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  And then we have to come to their defense. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=378.32s)]
*  What I'm trying to do here is making the American people aware that what this administration [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=380.08s)]
*  is doing right now, they are making serious mistakes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=385.67999999999995s)]
*  We've got to go into a negotiation strong. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=390.64s)]
*  Donald Trump thinks he looks strong, but he's really being a bully. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=392.92s)]
*  And he's, at least for the Russians, he's making us look weak. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=398.0s)]
*  Senator, I have to ask you, and I apologize in advance for doing this, but I have to ask [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=402.36s)]
*  you if you have any response tonight to what the president's top campaign donor, Mr. Musk, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=407.72s)]
*  said about you, bluntly calling you a traitor in response to you writing about your trip [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=413.48s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=417.92s)]
*  Well, Rachel, when I was 22 years old, before getting sworn into the Navy, or as I was getting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  sworn in to the United States Navy, I swore an oath to our Constitution to protect and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=424.88s)]
*  defend the Constitution. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=430.68s)]
*  I have lived that oath my entire life. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=432.48s)]
*  I flew in combat in the first Gulf War. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=435.52000000000004s)]
*  I served in the United States Navy for 25 years. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  I spent 15 years at NASA risking my life flying the space shuttle. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  The only oath I can think of that maybe Elon has sworn is an oath to his own checking account, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  to his pocketbook, an oath maybe to ruining the lives of veterans. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=453.48s)]
*  I had veterans in my office last week who, after really good performance reports, found [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=458.6s)]
*  out that Elon Musk fired them for poor performance. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=465.24s)]
*  He has ruined these people's lives. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=469.0s)]
*  They were serving our country again in very valuable roles, and they did not deserve to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  get fired by an email from an unelected billionaire. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=477.76000000000005s)]
*  So I think Elon needs to, you know, go back to making rockets. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, that's what he should focus on. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=489.20000000000005s)]
*  He shouldn't be focused on this slash and burn of the federal government. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=491.04s)]
*  And by the way, Rachel, he's doing it for one reason. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=495.04s)]
*  He's doing this so they create a little space so the big giant tax cuts that they're going [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=497.72s)]
*  to give for millionaires and billionaires do not look as bad, does not add as much to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=502.36s)]
*  the debt and deficit. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=508.36s)]
*  And the way he's going to do it is he's firing people, and then on top of that, he's going [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  to cut healthcare for kids, kids that, a third of kids get their healthcare, or a third of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=514.48s)]
*  people that get their healthcare from Medicaid are children, and he's going to cut healthcare [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  for seniors. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  All to give this big tax cut. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=527.64s)]
*  So I would prefer if Elon went back to his old job, you know, at SpaceX and Tesla. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=529.64s)]
*  It seems like certainly Starlink could, SpaceX could use some executive help at this point. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=537.04s)]
*  Maybe, maybe some more time might be available. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=543.64s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly, I really appreciate you taking time tonight. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=545.8s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us tonight, sir. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=548.16s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j471VU51MlI&t=549.88s)]
