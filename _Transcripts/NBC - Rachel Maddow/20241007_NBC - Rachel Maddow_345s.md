Video Description: Rachel Maddow reports on the increasingly dark picture Donald Trump and JD Vance are painting of their intentions toward immigrants if they are elected to the White House, with Trump describing immigrants as having bad genes that cause them to commit crimes, and Vance proposing deporting tens of millions of people by a means that is hard to imagine wouldn't be inhumane.

# Trump, Vance go too far as 'bad genes' remark and vow to deport tens of millions sends dark message
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE)
*  If you've been thinking that it might be a good time for you to volunteer, right, if you're already registered to vote you're thinking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=0.0s)]
*  What else I should I do? Maybe this is an election that's important enough that I should do something [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=4.58s)]
*  Maybe in thinking you've been thinking you should do some phone banking or [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=8.1s)]
*  Canvassing door-to-door. Maybe you've been thinking I can't really do that. But maybe I should donate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=12.0s)]
*  Now is the time it's less than a month left. It won't do much good if you wait much longer people are already voting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=17.68s)]
*  Now is the time no matter who your candidate is or what the issue is that you want to work on it is time to go [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=24.22s)]
*  It is time to do it and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=29.04s)]
*  With time getting this short and the election as close as it is at this point. Honestly, everything matters. I [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=31.36s)]
*  Mean Trump is telling people at his rallies that the Biden administration is refusing to help people affected by the hurricane [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=39.4s)]
*  Because it's taken all the disaster money and given all the money to immigrants instead [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=45.64s)]
*  And that's not even the tiniest bit true [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=51.0s)]
*  But Trump is making anything and everything in his campaign relate back to immigration [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=54.1s)]
*  Where he is getting darker and darker and darker in the way that he talks about immigrants in order to try to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=60.18000000000001s)]
*  Stir up maximum emotion [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=67.82000000000001s)]
*  maximum division [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=70.54s)]
*  Among people who are listening to him [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  Having previously translated from the original German a nice little phrase about how immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  Trump now is telling people he recently told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that immigrants have quote bad genes a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=81.86s)]
*  Little riff that he was doing about immigrants being murderers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=91.22s)]
*  He said it's because quote I believe this it's in their genes and we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=94.64s)]
*  No pushback on this pronouncement at all during the interview which is unsettling in itself [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=104.22s)]
*  But now I guess we have to wait and see if this is going to become a regular riff for Trump right where he talks [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=109.5s)]
*  About what he's going to do to get rid of all the bad genes that we have in this country right the people with bad genetics [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  So you're gonna clean that up in our country our bad genetics [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=120.22s)]
*  How many people are we talking about being cleansed for their bad genetics here [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=125.61999999999999s)]
*  JD Vance did an interview just earlier this year 2024 [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  February this year where he said that he believes [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=137.06s)]
*  quote 10% of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  The population of the United States is quote illegal aliens [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=142.82s)]
*  That means he thinks 33 million people in this country are here illegally and that's not all he then said immediately [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  Probably 10% of our population is illegal aliens and another 15% another 15% are in an irregular [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=156.02s)]
*  Situation with the law [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=164.26s)]
*  Think about that for a second another 15% [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=166.82s)]
*  So that means he thinks that 25% of the population of the United States shouldn't be here [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  They're either straight-up illegal or they are in an irregular situation with the law [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  This is what JD Vance describes as America's quote terrible migration crisis [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=183.06s)]
*  33 million people in America who he says are flat-out illegal and another 50 million who he describes as in an [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=189.28s)]
*  irregular situation with the law [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  This is the group that Trump says his running mate says has bad genes gives us bad genes in this country [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=201.16s)]
*  It's 83 million people that JD Vance is putting in this category one out of every four people in this country that what gotta go [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  That you think have bad genetics one out of every four people in America's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=214.48s)]
*  83 million people and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=219.56s)]
*  83 million people are the crisis that you guys are gonna clean up [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=222.28s)]
*  83 million people really [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=227.8s)]
*  Is it starting to sound like maybe it's too much from these guys maybe they're overplaying their hand a little bit here [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=232.76s)]
*  With with time this short and the election as close as it is everything matters [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Here's something else Donald Trump has not [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=244.92s)]
*  Withdrawn his endorsement for the North Carolina Republican candidate for governor who called himself a Nazi in an online porn forum [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  Who praised slavery and who has yet to offer any substantive explanation for what appeared to be his other many many many many [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=255.0s)]
*  lurid [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  Unquoteable prolific posts on porn forums [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=265.16s)]
*  Trump's endorsement of Mark Robinson stands [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=271.48s)]
*  Here was Trump's running mates response. Here was JD Vance's response when he was asked about Mark Robinson [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=274.52s)]
*  Are you comfortable with [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=280.92s)]
*  Mark Robinson as the Republican nominee for governor in North Carolina? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=283.44s)]
*  Well, if the allegations are pretty far out there, of course [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=286.8s)]
*  The allegations aren't necessarily reality and what I'd say is it's ultimately up to Mark Robinson in North Carolina [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=289.3s)]
*  Whether he's gonna be their governor. Do you believe him that those were not his posts? I don't not believe him [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't believe him. I just think that you have to let these things sometimes play out in the court of public opinion [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=299.94s)]
*  He's gonna make whatever arguments he wants to make I [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=304.18s)]
*  Don't not believe him. I don't believe him. This will just play out I got [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=307.86s)]
*  Called himself a Nazi praised Mein Kampf praised slavery [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=313.58s)]
*  Not exactly courageous strong stuff from JD Vance there on the I am a black Nazi porn site governor candidate [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41H3aY5UsE&t=317.3s)]
