# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 26
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I)
*  But we actually have to start tonight with some breaking news related to the special counsel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=0.0s)]
*  indictment of Trump on those classified documents charges. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=5.84s)]
*  When special counsel Jack Smith brought those 37 federal criminal charges against Trump earlier [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  this month in the classified documents case, remember these were charges for willful retention [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=16.48s)]
*  of national defense information at his home in Florida, also false statements and obstruction. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=21.92s)]
*  You might remember in the indictment there was sort of at length detail given of a supposed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  audio recording of Donald Trump. Oh lordy, there are tapes. According to the indictment, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=36.08s)]
*  there is a tape from July 2021 when Trump was at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=42.64s)]
*  And according to the indictment, Trump in this recorded conversation, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  he's allegedly speaking with a writer who's working on a book about the Trump administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=53.76s)]
*  And according to the indictment, during that conversation, Trump seems at least to show this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=58.72s)]
*  writer some documents that he says are classified. Now you can't do that. A, you shouldn't have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=66.8s)]
*  classified documents after you leave the presidency. But B, you shouldn't be able to show them ever to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=74.24s)]
*  somebody who's not got proper security clearances and a need to see them. The indictment quotes from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=80.24s)]
*  this supposed tape. It describes Trump showing the writer a piece of paper and allegedly saying, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=87.28s)]
*  quote, I just found, isn't that amazing? It's like highly confidential secret. This is secret [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=94.16s)]
*  information. As president, I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=100.16s)]
*  secret. It's crazy, right? I mean, if you were inventing like cartoon level, you did it wrong [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=106.56s)]
*  allegations for somebody mishandling classified information, you'd like this, you'd dream this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=118.0s)]
*  up as a hypothetical to teach 1L law students, right? Imagine there was a tape in which the, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=123.92s)]
*  which the accused said, no, I'm not supposed to be showing this to you. It's really secret. But [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=129.76s)]
*  look, here it is. I mean, it's just a prosecutor's dream to have something like this on tape. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=136.16s)]
*  But all we could see in the indictment was prosecutors allegation that this tape existed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=142.96s)]
*  and that on this tape, Trump said those things. And, you know, as an allegation, it's damning [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=149.44s)]
*  that the special counsel is alleging that Trump improperly held on to classified information. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=156.96s)]
*  Here allegedly was this description of audio evidence of Trump appearing to admit that he was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=162.08s)]
*  in possession of secret material, that it's not declassified, it's classified material, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=168.08s)]
*  and he's nevertheless showing it to people who are absolutely not clear to see it at this meeting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=172.4s)]
*  at his golf course. Thanks to the indictment, we've all read the transcript of that supposed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  recording. But now tonight, we can all hear it because CNN tonight and kudos to them for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=184.56s)]
*  nailing this. CNN tonight has obtained the audio recording of Donald Trump, in which he appears to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=192.8s)]
*  tell a writer that he is knowingly in possession of classified material. Now I should tell you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=201.36s)]
*  that this is CNN's reporting. NBC News has not authenticated this recording. But if what CNN [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  has obtained is legit, what it appears to be is the tape that's described in the indictment, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=214.4s)]
*  the evidence that helped lay the groundwork for special counsel Jack Smith to indict Donald Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  So here it is. I'm going to play the whole thing for you now. Listen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=228.24s)]
*  These are bad, sick people. That was your coup, you know, against you. Well, it started right at [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  the beginning. Like when Milley's talking about, oh, you were going to try to do a coup. No, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=241.44s)]
*  they were trying to do that before you even were sworn in. That's right. Trying to overthrow your [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=244.96s)]
*  election. Well, with Milley, let me see that. I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=249.68s)]
*  attack Iran. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=257.12s)]
*  This was him. They presented me this. This is off the record, but they presented me this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=265.52s)]
*  This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. We looked at him. This was him. This [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=271.68s)]
*  wasn't done by me. This was him. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Let's see here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=278.0s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know, except it is like highly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=289.84s)]
*  confidential, secretive. This is secretive. Look at this. You attack and- Hillary would [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=296.48s)]
*  print that out all the time, you know. She'd send it to Anthony Weiner, the pervert. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  By the way, isn't that incredible? Yeah. I was just saying, because we were talking about it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  And he said, he wanted to attack Iran and what? He said the papers. This was done by the military, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  given to me. I think we can probably, right? We'll have to see. Yeah, we'll have to try to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=325.6s)]
*  de-classify. See, as president, I could have de-classified. No, I can't, you know, but this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=334.48s)]
*  is- Oh, yeah. We have a problem. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. It's so cool. Look, we heard [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  Ivan- and you probably almost didn't believe me, but now you believe me. It's incredible, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  No. Hey, bring some, bring some cokes in, please. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=351.6s)]
*  Bring some cokes in, please. That does give it at least the ring of authenticity, doesn't it? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=355.84s)]
*  I'll show you an example. Look. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Look. This was the defense [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  department. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Look. This is secret information. Look. Look at this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=369.52s)]
*  This was the defense department. These are the papers. This was done by the military, and given [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=377.76s)]
*  to me. I think we can probably, right? Staffer. I don't know. Well, we'll have to see. Yeah, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=398.8s)]
*  we'll have to. Trump, de-classify it. Trump. See, as president, I could have de-classified it. Now, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=403.84s)]
*  I can't, you know, but this is classified. Isn't that interesting? It's so cool. Can we get some [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=409.84s)]
*  cokes? I mean, let's just drill down on the specifics of this for a second. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  In Jack Smith bringing charges against Donald Trump, the sort of crux of the case, right, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  is that the prosecution has to be able to prove that Trump had classified documents in his [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=430.56s)]
*  possession after he left the presidency, right? That's the illegal activity alleged in the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=436.96s)]
*  indictment. And here in this part of the tape is Donald Trump saying he had possession of classified [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  information after leaving the presidency. Except it is highly confidential. This is secret. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  It's highly confidential. This is secret information. This is secret information. Look, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=460.4s)]
*  look, look at my secret information. It's one thing to sort of read these words as part of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  the indictment. It's another thing to hear it. Another key part of Jack Smith's case against [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=474.32s)]
*  Trump is proving not only that Trump had these documents in his possession, but that he knew [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  that it was no longer in his power as an ex-president to declassify them, right? So [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=485.12s)]
*  again, part of his sort of purported defense or part of his attempted defense, if he could even [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=491.68s)]
*  call it that, it doesn't even seem that coherent, is to say, yes, these things were classified, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=498.0s)]
*  but I used my mind to declassify them. Here he is on tape admitting that he does not have the power [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=503.6s)]
*  to declassify these things and these are still classified. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=511.12s)]
*  As president, I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is classified. Isn't [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=525.84s)]
*  that interesting? It's so cool. It's a lot of things. I'm not sure cool is like in the top 6,000, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=532.32s)]
*  but this is definitely the kind of thing that sounds like it should end up in a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  federal criminal indictment. I'll give you that. Joining us now is Barbara McQuade, former US [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=544.0s)]
*  attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. She's a professor at the University of Michigan [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  School of Law. Barbara, thank you very much for being with us tonight. I'm so glad we were able [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=554.72s)]
*  to get you here for this story with this late breaking news. Oh, glad to be here, Rachel. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=558.08s)]
*  So let me just get your top line reaction. We obviously had some of this tape described in the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=564.48s)]
*  indictment line for line. There were some ellipses in the indictment. Not every line that's on this [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=574.4s)]
*  tape was reflected in the indictment. It strikes me as potentially important when Trump says [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=579.84s)]
*  explicitly, these are the papers, which would seem to cast no doubt on whether or not he was [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=586.56s)]
*  actually holding papers that he was describing to this writer. But as a prosecutor, as a former [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=592.96s)]
*  prosecutor, as a lawyer, how do you hear this as evidence? Well, I have two reactions to it. One is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=598.0s)]
*  as a former prosecutor, it makes my hair stand on end a little bit to see this in the public domain. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=604.0s)]
*  Prosecutors try to keep this stuff safeguarded so that you can't have witness tampering and [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=609.04s)]
*  crowdsourcing of defenses now that people can because this is in the public domain. But as a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=614.32s)]
*  matter of evidence, this is some really powerful evidence. We had seen some verbatim quotes from [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=619.68s)]
*  this recording that was in the indictment. But to hear the whole thing play out, I think, is [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  incredible evidence. And at trial, it will not just be this recording that's played in a vacuum. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=632.0s)]
*  They will have to authenticate this document with this recording with someone who was there. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=638.4s)]
*  So whether it is the biographer or the publisher or one of the two staffers, one or more of them [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=643.04s)]
*  will have to be there. And one question I think they'll be asked is, did you look at it? Because [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=648.96s)]
*  it sure sounds like he's showing it to them. And they're actually reading it. So I think it proves [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=652.96s)]
*  a couple of things. One, as you said, his knowledge and intent, which is important here about that he [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=658.48s)]
*  is willfully violating the law. And the other is the incredible recklessness with which he is treating [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=663.2800000000001s)]
*  our national secrets. So it's a very powerful piece of evidence. And, Barb, let me just ask you [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=668.4000000000001s)]
*  about one of those points that you just made about the fact that it seems when you hear this [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=673.76s)]
*  back and forth, it seems like the person who he's in conversation with is looking at the documents. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=678.64s)]
*  I mean, I got the sense of I got sort of that as a vague impression from reading it in the indictment. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=683.76s)]
*  Hearing it, that seems much more clear. Again, that that part of the tape, I have a big pile of [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  papers, this thing just came up. Look, this was him. He's talking about Mark Milley. They presented [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=694.56s)]
*  me this this is off the record, but they presented me this this was him. This was the Defense [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=699.28s)]
*  Department and him. And then the person he's speaking to the writer says, wow, as if they are [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=703.28s)]
*  looking at the thing that he is imploring the person to look at. This wasn't done by me. This [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=709.12s)]
*  was him all sorts of stuff, pages long. Look, when the writer, the other person in the room says, wow, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=714.8s)]
*  it does appear that he wasn't just, you know, waving it in the distance showing that papers [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=721.92s)]
*  existed, but rather asking the person to view the content of that material. And that does, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  just as a layperson makes me wonder why dissemination of classified material [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=732.8s)]
*  wasn't charged. It does seem like they've got evidence that he showed it to at least one other [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=739.1999999999999s)]
*  person. Yeah, that's how it lands with me as well. And as we said, I think they're going to call that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=743.68s)]
*  witness, you know, they got this recording from somebody, my guess is it came through some sort [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  of grand jury subpoena or request from the person who was in the room recording it for the purpose of [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=753.6s)]
*  gathering information for this biography. And so certainly it is a separate crime to disclose [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=758.64s)]
*  classified information to a person who is not authorized to receive it. That could be another [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=764.88s)]
*  charge. Now, my guess is this occurred in Bedminster, I believe in New Jersey. And so it [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=769.36s)]
*  would be technically improper to charge it in Florida because there would not be proper venue [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=774.64s)]
*  there. But I know some have suggested perhaps this is a charge prosecutors are keeping in their [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=778.96s)]
*  pocket that could be filed in a separate indictment in the district of New Jersey. So that's one [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=783.4399999999999s)]
*  possible theory for that. Barbara McQuade, invaluable to have you here tonight. Thank you [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=788.56s)]
*  so much, Barb. Let's have some cokes. We'll send out for them. So the fighter jet forces this [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=793.52s)]
*  passenger airplane down, it lands at Minsk, nobody knows why. But once they're on the ground, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=803.28s)]
*  Belarusian police storm the plane and grab a guy. A 26 year old blogger, he was the editor of a [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=808.7199999999999s)]
*  Telegram channel that was critical of Belarus's dictator and was supportive of the protests that [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=816.56s)]
*  had sprung up in that country the previous year in 2020, after Belarus's dictator really did appear [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=824.4s)]
*  to have lost an election, but he decided he was going to stay in power anyway. And it's amazing [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=830.4799999999999s)]
*  thing, right? In modern day Europe, this dictator used a MiG fighter jet to force down a European [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=836.64s)]
*  commercial flight that wasn't even supposed to be landing in his country. He forced that plane down [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=844.32s)]
*  into his country specifically to get this kid off the plane so we could throw him in prison. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=849.84s)]
*  The Belarusian dictator did that. His name is Alexander Lukashenko. And even if you've never [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=856.4000000000001s)]
*  heard of Lukashenko, even if you have never in your life given one thought to the country called [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  Belarus, I swear he is exactly what you are imagining when you think to yourself, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=866.96s)]
*  what does a Belarusian dictator look like? Just imagine, right? Look, magic. Exactly that guy, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=874.64s)]
*  right? Giant, like comically oversized military hat, regulation size and shape, Saddam style, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=882.64s)]
*  dictator mustache. He likes to be seen holding guns of all shapes and sizes, just randomly and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=890.88s)]
*  for no reason makes him feel like a big man, almost as big as when he wears the big hat. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=898.16s)]
*  During the nationwide protests against him in 2020, after he stole that election, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=904.08s)]
*  he put on fake military gear, the kind of generic like Amazon Prime branded stuff that gets called [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=909.2s)]
*  tactical because it has extra snaps. He put on this little fake military suit [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=916.64s)]
*  and walked around to try to get tough guy points against the women and students who were protesting [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=924.0s)]
*  against his dictatorship in 2020. Alexander Lukashenko is technically the elected president [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=929.04s)]
*  of Belarus, but he was elected in 1994. And he's been there ever since. He's the longest serving [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=936.88s)]
*  dictator, I mean, president in Europe. And it's not because he keeps getting reelected in free and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=944.16s)]
*  fair elections. And forgive me for saying it this way, but as dictators go, Alexander Lukashenko [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  is kind of a sad sack nutball. He's he is as weak as he is brutal, which is a bad pairing that goes [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=959.68s)]
*  together all too often. For Lukashenko, the main hallmark of the later stages of his reign as the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=967.04s)]
*  longest standing dictator in Europe is not just that he kills and oppresses his own people and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=974.56s)]
*  aggregates all the wealth and potential of his country to himself and his family. It's that he's [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  bowing and scraping subservient to Vladimir Putin and Russia. He is as brutal as he is weak. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=987.68s)]
*  But the relationship between Lukashenko and Putin has led to some real weirdness, especially in [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=997.04s)]
*  recent months, especially after those protests that could have toppled Lukashenko, but they didn't, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1005.36s)]
*  especially after Putin sent in forces to reinforce Lukashenko against the people protesting against [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1011.12s)]
*  him in his own country. Since then, Lukashenko and Putin appear to have been trying to create some [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1016.88s)]
*  kind of super state of their two countries, one in which Belarus is sort of more or less willingly [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1022.4s)]
*  subsumed into Russia. This has led just within the past couple of weeks to Russia moving nuclear [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1029.12s)]
*  weapons into Belarus. Now that's a big deal. I mean, when the USSR dissolved in 1991, all the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1036.32s)]
*  former Soviet states, except for Russia itself, gave up their nuclear weapons. This very recent, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1043.68s)]
*  this month transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia into Belarus, that's the first time [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1049.04s)]
*  Russia's moved nuclear weapons outside its borders since the USSR collapsed. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1053.68s)]
*  And it's not like Lukashenko is like a real stable genius in terms of, you know, feeling [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1059.68s)]
*  comfortable that he's now in control of these things. On the occasion of receiving these nuclear [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1065.04s)]
*  weapons, what did Lukashenko do? Well, he gave a bizarre statement to the press in which he said, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1069.52s)]
*  if any other country wants to join in this new union he's making with Putin, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1076.64s)]
*  they should just call him up. He said, I'm not speaking for Putin here. I'm just speaking for me. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1082.64s)]
*  But he says he's pretty sure they'd be happy to take anyone, any other country. So if you want to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1087.2s)]
*  bring your country into this new union with Russia and Belarus, Lukashenko says, in return for you [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1092.3200000000002s)]
*  joining their union, he'll give your country nuclear weapons as a thank you. Again, he said he [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  wasn't speaking for Putin, but he's pretty sure Putin would go along with it. Anybody wants to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1105.68s)]
*  join our club, I'll give you nukes. This is within minutes of him getting nukes. So I know this is [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1109.92s)]
*  not a part of the world we usually pay much attention to, right? There's no big like Western [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1118.5600000000002s)]
*  news bureaus in Minsk that we're all taking live shots from on Monday nights. But in recent months, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1122.16s)]
*  things have been getting increasingly weird in that corner of the world under that increasingly [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1128.8s)]
*  weird, weak, unstable dictator. And now all of a sudden, that guy is the trusted authority. He's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1134.08s)]
*  the calm hand. He's the man who the world is apparently entrusting with stopping a civil war [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1143.4399999999998s)]
*  in the largest country on the planet. That guy. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1149.04s)]
*  you [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwCSt5mIt0I&t=1194.08s)]
