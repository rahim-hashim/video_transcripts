# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs)
*  It was only a few decades ago that Russian forces were right here in Budapest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=0.0s)]
*  In 1956, when Hungary was under the control of the Soviet Union, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=6.0s)]
*  Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest to put down a democratic revolution in this city. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=10.4s)]
*  The crackdown was successful and it was brutal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=16.6s)]
*  Some 2500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet soldiers were killed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=19.6s)]
*  Nearly a quarter million Hungarians fled the country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=26.2s)]
*  That whole thing was over in a week and Hungary's democratic aspirations would have to wait until the fall of the Soviet Union more than 30 years later. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=30.0s)]
*  But not all Soviet military interventions were that short or successful. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=39.2s)]
*  Most famously, the Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan in 1979 and ended up bogged down there for a decade. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=44.6s)]
*  The war was a disaster for Afghanistan where something like 2 million Afghan civilians were killed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=53.8s)]
*  But it was a debacle for the Soviet military. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=59.6s)]
*  They lost nearly 15,000 Soviet troops over 10 years and ultimately had to give up and retreat. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=62.4s)]
*  The Soviet Union itself collapsed just two years later in part because of the unpopularity and cost of that war. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=69.6s)]
*  And so here is something worth considering. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=76.8s)]
*  If that Afghanistan was a military catastrophe, a humiliating defeat that contributed to the fall of a global superpower, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=80.2s)]
*  15,000 soldiers killed over a decade. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=89.0s)]
*  What would we call an invasion in which Russia has lost half that number in just three weeks? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=92.0s)]
*  Because that is what American intelligence officials say has happened according to new reporting by the New York Times. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=99.6s)]
*  More than 7,000 Russian troops killed in Ukraine since the invasion began and that they say is a conservative estimate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=106.6s)]
*  Now, if those American intelligence estimates are accurate, and of course we have no way of independently verifying them, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=115.2s)]
*  that would be a staggering number of casualties for Russian forces to have sustained in three weeks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=123.2s)]
*  7,000 is the number of Marines killed in 36 days of fighting on Iwo Jima, one of the fiercest battles of World War II. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=129.0s)]
*  7,000 is greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=137.4s)]
*  And it's not just the casualty numbers that point to a Russian army in disarray. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=145.2s)]
*  Today, a British military intelligence assessment echoed what American defense officials have been saying, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts as they fend off constant Ukrainian counterattacks. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=155.0s)]
*  Four Russian generals have reportedly been killed in the fighting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=163.8s)]
*  Western officials say the generals may be pushing closer to the front lines to try and boost flagging morale among the Russian troops, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=167.0s)]
*  making them more vulnerable to attack themselves. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=174.0s)]
*  The New York Times reports, quote, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=177.0s)]
*  two American military officials said that many Russian generals are talking on unsecured phones and radios. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=178.4s)]
*  In at least one instance, they said, the Ukrainians intercepted a general's call, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=184.8s)]
*  geo located it and attacked his location, killing him and his staff, end quote. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=190.0s)]
*  And then there's Russia's loss of costly military hardware. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has this report, headline, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=199.4s)]
*  Ukraine has become a graveyard for Russian tanks, with analysts saying that this is likely the highest number of tanks destroyed in such a short period since World War II. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=201.2s)]
*  Now, all of this bad news is having repercussions back in Moscow. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=212.6s)]
*  Russian news sources have reported that Vladimir Putin has put two of his top intelligence officials under house arrest. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=215.4s)]
*  A Russian security services expert tells the Times that the two men were interrogated for providing poor intelligence ahead of the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=222.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Russian military is reporting so reportedly so desperate for new soldiers that recruiters are targeting and pressuring Central Asian immigrants who are working in Russia, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=231.0s)]
*  basically telling them if they want Russian citizenship, they need to sign up to go fight in Ukraine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=241.4s)]
*  That reporting is from the Moscow Times, an independent Russian newspaper that as of last week is now operating out of Amsterdam because of the Kremlin's media crackdown. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=247.6s)]
*  Russia's military troubles were the theme of a new video message tonight from Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=257.4s)]
*  He claimed that Ukrainian forces have killed 13,000 Russian soldiers and taken thousands of prisoners. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=262.4s)]
*  Speaking in Russian, he addressed the mothers of the Russian soldiers, telling them that Ukraine never wanted all these dead bodies and prisoners, quote, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=269.0s)]
*  We did not want this war. All we want is peace and for you to love your children more than you are afraid of your government. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=277.0s)]
*  American and British officials are now saying that Russian forces have suffered significant casualties and setbacks since the war began. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=285.0s)]
*  As the New York Times put it today, Pentagon officials say a 10% casualty rate, including dead and wounded for a single unit, renders it unable to carry out combat related tasks. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=292.6s)]
*  With more than 150,000 Russian troops now involved in the war in Ukraine, Russian casualties, when including the estimated 14,000 to 21,000 injured, are near that level. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=302.6s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the most one of the people bylined on that report. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=317.2s)]
*  Eric Schmidt is a senior writer covering terrorism and national security for the New York Times. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=320.2s)]
*  Eric, thank you for being with us. First of all, help me understand the differing claims of the number of soldiers who have died. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=326.2s)]
*  We get claims from the Ukrainians that are higher than what this estimate that you're reporting on is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=333.2s)]
*  How do we determine the accuracy of what the U.S. intelligence community is saying, that it's somewhere around 7,000 troops in the first three weeks of fighting? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=338.8s)]
*  These are very difficult numbers to come by, Ali, and it is an imprecise science to be sure. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=348.8s)]
*  You've got the Russians who are coming with very low numbers in the high hundreds figures. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=353.8s)]
*  Then you have the Ukrainians who mentioned are somewhere 13 or 14,000. That's probably well inflated. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=357.8s)]
*  The Pentagon is looking at those numbers. They look at other social media claims. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=363.8s)]
*  They're also looking at battle damage assessment. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=367.4s)]
*  That's the military term for looking at the damage done to tanks, to armored vehicles, other things that troops are in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=370.4s)]
*  Basically estimating by the number of troops they know are in these different vehicles and then extrapolating from that, that will help the estimate as well. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=377.4s)]
*  Even Pentagon officials say the 7,000 figure, while conservative, is an imprecise one. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=386.4s)]
*  They're searching for better ways to get a better handle on it, but that is the number that they're going with right now. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=392.0s)]
*  It is, as you said in your opening report, quite staggering. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=399.0s)]
*  It is staggering. We've also heard that between three and four generals have been killed. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=404.0s)]
*  Investigation into one of them is whether or not they were using an unsecured cell phone or radio that allowed them to be geo-targeted. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=409.0s)]
*  The one thing that U.S. intelligence, which was otherwise very accurate about before this invasion, the one thing they were off on was the speed with which Russia would be able to overtake Ukraine. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=415.6s)]
*  It's just unfolding unlike anything anyone expected. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=426.6s)]
*  That's right. The Russians, by all accounts, felt they could get into Kiev, the capital, within one or two days, basically take over the leadership there and then probably take over most of the country in the next week or two. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=431.6s)]
*  That obviously hasn't happened for a couple of big reasons. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=443.2s)]
*  One is just the fierce resistance they met from the Ukrainians, as your report is documented right now. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=445.2s)]
*  The other thing is they overestimated their own capabilities going into Ukraine. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=451.2s)]
*  Serious logistics problems, shortages of fuel, of food, of spare parts. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=455.2s)]
*  We've heard of widespread reports of conscripts, young and inexperienced troops who were not told they were going into a war zone, basically walking away from some of the most dangerous places in the world. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=460.2s)]
*  They were told they were going into a war zone, basically walking away from some of their vehicles and some of these convoys we've heard that have been stalled going into Kiev. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=469.8s)]
*  So it's been a collection of errors on the logistical side. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=476.8s)]
*  It's also been a flawed campaign of the ground forces not really being synced up with the air forces in a normal way you've had your battle. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=479.8s)]
*  And so what they've had do is resort to the tactics that your earlier report mentioned, stand back and pummel these cities with artillery, long-range missiles, and some aerial bombing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=488.8s)]
*  And again, to people who are not sort of trained in understanding military techniques, it's hard to understand. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=499.8s)]
*  But really this means you can't be bombing or shelling a city or shelling locations where your troops are located. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=507.8s)]
*  So if the troops, the ground troops are not able to do what they're supposed to do, now what we're seeing is, as Cal was reporting, Russian troops retreating from those positions, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=514.8s)]
*  somehow sometimes leaving dead Russian soldiers behind while they call in air support, which then bombards an area. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=522.4s)]
*  It's an inefficient way of doing things to say the least. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=528.4s)]
*  That's right. It's quite a brutal way of doing things. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=531.4s)]
*  What's happening is on the outskirts of all these cities you've mentioned, the Ukrainian forces are basically fighting the much numerically superior and technologically superior Russian forces, roughly to a standstill. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=535.4s)]
*  So rather than being able to advance further and inring most of these cities, the Russians are having to stand back and use the one weapon they do have a lot of, and that is artillery and these missiles and basically weapons of terror at this point, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=548.0s)]
*  trying forcing the civilian population to flee, damaging much of the cities and basically trying to take over from there. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=561.0s)]
*  What we haven't seen yet is urban combat. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=567.0s)]
*  The Russians trying to get inside of the streets of these cities, that's where it could get really bloody and really bad, even worse than what we've seen now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=569.6s)]
*  In the few instances where we have seen that, however, it seems initially the Ukrainians seem to have an advantage. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=580.6s)]
*  In places like Kiev, where they have sort of retreated to areas that they control inside the city to draw Russians in, it seems to result in some confusion, obviously, because the Russian soldiers don't know the landscape. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=587.6s)]
*  They don't know the territory as well, so that becomes advantage Ukrainian forces. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=599.6s)]
*  Absolutely. The Ukrainians know the terrain, they're fighting on their home turf, and they're highly motivated to defend their homeland, whereas we've seen the Russian morale, whether it's at the conscripted troops force, all the way up to some of these general offices you've mentioned. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=604.6s)]
*  It's somewhat in disarray now. Morale is bad. They're not really fighting for a cause they believe in, whereas the Ukrainians, rallied by President Zelensky, are fighting hard, unexpectedly hard, and hanging in there. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=618.2s)]
*  Again, we'll see how long this can last though, because again, the Russian military, one of the strongest in the world, going up against Ukraine now, it's a tough fight all the way around. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=631.2s)]
*  Given the opportunity to send their loved ones to safety, it is no wonder that Ukrainian families are living apart. And while the pain of that is no doubt immeasurable, today there was a little bit of good news for Ina Sovson and her family. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=640.8s)]
*  This week, she made the decision to briefly leave the city to see her son Martin, and today she shared this picture. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=654.8s)]
*  When a two-day curfew was announced in Kyiv, I took it as a sign that I need to go see my son in Western Ukraine. After all, I needed to check if he's doing his maths. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=661.4s)]
*  Joining us now, Ina Sovson. She's a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. We have many matters to discuss, and we're so grateful that you're back with us. But the most important question is, has Martin been doing his maths? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=671.4s)]
*  Well, it was time for me to come to make sure that he's doing more. So there is the right issues that we needed to discuss. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=683.0s)]
*  Well said. That is a good answer from a mother. Bearing in mind that you don't want to disclose, we don't want to disclose where you are, but can you describe some of the things that you saw as you journeyed west from Kyiv to reunite with your son? What was it like before you left, and what did you see on the way? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=692.0s)]
*  So in order to travel to the Western Ukraine, I took a train. Now all the trains are free. So you just get to the train station, you take the train, and you ask, like, can I get in? You get in. The trains are overcrowded, but not as they were about two weeks ago. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=710.6s)]
*  They don't give you a precise schedule. They just tell you, like, we can be in this city at around this time, but we can be one to two hours late. And there are many people who are trying to evacuate fully. So there were many people with the bags and cats and dogs and all. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=728.2s)]
*  And on some station, there was the nice part of the journey. The train conductors came to the people and said, like, do you want something to eat? And people were not sure if they should pay or not. And then they said, these are from volunteers who just have given food to people traveling to the west. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=746.8s)]
*  And so that was a very sad journey, because I could see many people were just fleeing. There was a couple from Kharkiv that I was traveling close to, people from Kiev Oblast that were trying to escape to some parts of Western Ukraine. So that is the story as it is. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=764.4s)]
*  And then when I came to the Western Ukraine, it is safer than it is in other parts of Ukraine, but they're still getting the sirens here. So Martin, my son, he first he saw me, he hugged me, and then he said, oh, mom, I'm going to tell you a hilarious story. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=783.0s)]
*  And I was like, okay, go on. And he said, like, yesterday, we were playing after school. He has online school now. We decided to go outside and we were putting out on our clothes. It took us a while to get ready, so on and so forth. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=797.4s)]
*  And the very second we get out of the door, we hear the sirens and we have to go back to the bunker. And he was thinking that this is funny because like this happened the very second they went outside. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=810.5s)]
*  But I heard that and I thought like, oh, my gosh, I so much hate Putin for the very fact that my son now knows like then when you hear siren, you have to go back inside and get into the bunker. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=821.6999999999999s)]
*  I do want to get your reaction to the news of your hometown of Harkiv, where Russian forces are continuing to bomb the area. They've caused a fire at one of those largest street markets, which I'm sure you're familiar from with. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=833.0s)]
*  Are you hearing from friends and family in eastern Ukraine who are really suffering this bombardment? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=846.0s)]
*  This large market that you're referring to, actually, my dad worked at that market still 2014 when they moved to to Kiev region. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=851.0s)]
*  So I know that place so very well. It's literally one of the hugest street markets in Europe, I believe. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=860.0s)]
*  It's a workplace for many people. It employed many people in Harkiv. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=867.0s)]
*  And it's just one of the new attacks in the Kiev, sorry, in Harkiv. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=873.0s)]
*  My parents don't live there anymore. But of course, we do have many friends and family members there. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=879.0s)]
*  And I was talking to my mom recently and asked her, like, have you been in touch with those people and those people? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=884.0s)]
*  And the majority of people left the city to go like in Harkiv region, somewhere in smaller villages and all. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=890.0s)]
*  And we had some some family member who was distant relative. Let's put it this way. It's complicated. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=898.0s)]
*  But who was Russian? Like she was ethnically Russian. She had family in Russia and she was always very pro-Russian. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=904.0s)]
*  She was always claiming that we need to be closer with Russia. Those are our friends, our brothers. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=912.0s)]
*  And I don't understand what is the whole fuss about. And now she's in the city being bombarded. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=918.0s)]
*  And apparently her whole view of world and her understanding of world just blew up the very first moment that they heard the bombs exploding in Harkiv. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=926.0s)]
*  And she's extremely confused right now. But now she's not saying that Russians are our friends anymore, just like many other people. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=936.0s)]
*  I heard another story, again, friend of a friend situation who was again very pro-Russian. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=942.0s)]
*  He now joined the territorial defense and is ready to fight for the city. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=947.0s)]
*  So those those bombardments, they actually changed the understanding of the situation and geopolitics in Harkiv so rapidly. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=952.0s)]
*  Like this is one of the most patriotic and pro-Ukrainian city in Ukraine right now. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=959.0s)]
*  Today is Purim. It's a joyous Jewish holiday about saving the Jewish people from extermination at the hands of an evil government official. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=966.0s)]
*  And because of that origin story, the holiday has taken on greater significance this year. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=973.0s)]
*  I was lucky enough to be invited to a Purim celebration here in Budapest, which despite everything had lots of Ukrainian refugees in attendance. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=978.0s)]
*  This is a celebration of survival for Jewish people everywhere. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=990.0s)]
*  And for the man playing the guitar, survival means something different this year. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=994.0s)]
*  He and his family arrived here in Budapest after escaping Kiev just one week ago. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=999.0s)]
*  On this holiday, Purim, Jews traditionally spin noisy rattles called groggers to drown out the name of an oppressor more than 2500 years ago. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1004.0s)]
*  This year, Hungarian Jews spin them to drown out the sounds of war deafening their Ukrainian neighbors. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1013.0s)]
*  If we hear about the war, we try to send a message with this small with this noise that this war should stop immediately. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1020.0s)]
*  And we wish all the people in Ukraine will be free and released from this war. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1030.0s)]
*  The party is themed in blue and gold for Ukraine, people wearing buttons that say, Rattle for Peace. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1037.0s)]
*  Purim is an ancient festival amongst the Jews. It celebrates the victory of Mordecai and Esther over Hamam, the Persian official who was plotting to kill all the Jews of Persia. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1044.0s)]
*  Now it's celebrated here with noisemakers and gifts and food and drink, all of which take on heightened significance with the Jews that have now escaped Ukraine. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1055.0s)]
*  Tell me about the Jews that you've been meeting who have been coming here from Ukraine. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1063.0s)]
*  Well, in the last two weeks we have been seeing a great influx of refugees that have been coming from Ukraine, Jews and non-Jews as well. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1068.0s)]
*  We try to help everyone, but obviously the Jewish people that come through right away and make the connection with us. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1077.0s)]
*  Just three days after the war broke out, Rabbi Wolf from Odessa, a colleague of mine, Rabbi Nechabad in Odessa, he calls me up and says, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1082.0s)]
*  Rabbi Kovash, I don't know what to do, please try to help us. I have 150 kids, Jewish orphanages, that are not safe now. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1090.0s)]
*  They don't have parents, they don't even have passports. How do we take them to a safer place? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1097.0s)]
*  So we help to arrange them to come through the border without passports. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1102.0s)]
*  And on this night, this Budapest synagogue welcomes more than 50 Ukrainian refugees, brightening their lives in a particularly dark time. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1106.0s)]
*  Among the guests, the musician is a Jewish scholar named Pinkus, forced to flee Ukraine in a car on Saturday, the Shabbat, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1115.0s)]
*  something his interpretation of Jewish law would normally prohibit unless your life is in danger. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1123.0s)]
*  So we went out of the city, we went to another place, but it wasn't so safe there also. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1129.0s)]
*  We went to a place where people rest, 200 kilometers from Kiev. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1135.0s)]
*  There's a place for resting, like a Jewish base of resting, like this. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1141.0s)]
*  Also, there were many strikes there. Two nights we slept there, and it was also scary. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1145.0s)]
*  His family's safety now cause for celebration. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1152.0s)]
*  Safety that for Jewish people throughout history, and now all people of Ukraine, has never been guaranteed. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1155.0s)]
*  They built up a beautiful community just like this one, with a school, with synagogues, with old age homes, with orphanages. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1162.0s)]
*  And now, after 30 years, they just have to leave in one day, they just close the door and they don't know if they will return. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1168.0s)]
*  This breaks my heart, and I think it has to break all of our hearts. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1173.0s)]
*  And we have to all make sure that we tell all the decision makers, they should put down the guns, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1176.0s)]
*  and people should pray to God that some common sense should come to humanity, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1182.0s)]
*  to understand that you cannot achieve anything with war. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1187.0s)]
*  We should achieve everything with the love of your fellow. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd_Y_B8NQgs&t=1189.0s)]
