# Rudy Giuliani Reportedly The Ringleader Of Fake Trump Elector Scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM)
*  Turns out, it was Rudy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's the front page at CNN.com right now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=3.88s)]
*  Giuliani led fake electors' plot. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Here's the Washington Post's version of that same front page story today, as Giuliani [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=11.16s)]
*  coordinated plan for Trump electoral votes in states Biden won. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=16.6s)]
*  It was Mr. Giuliani, apparently. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=22.72s)]
*  You know, you find a little thread of a story. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=24.92s)]
*  You tug and you tug and you tug some more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=29.08s)]
*  And then one day you're like, ugh, one more tug on the same thread, and the whole sweater [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=31.0s)]
*  comes apart. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=35.48s)]
*  Today was the day the whole sweater came apart. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=36.48s)]
*  And now we're all sitting here in a pile of yarn going, oh, that's what it's made [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=38.8s)]
*  of. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=42.48s)]
*  Here's how CNN put it in their story on this tonight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=45.48s)]
*  Quote, Trump campaign officials led by Rudy Giuliani oversaw efforts in December 2020 [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=48.04s)]
*  to put forward illegitimate electors from states that Trump lost, according to three [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=52.0s)]
*  knowledge of the scheme. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=57.8s)]
*  Members of former President Donald Trump's campaign team were far more involved than [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  previously known in the plan, a core tenet of the broader plot to overturn President [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=63.32s)]
*  Biden's victory when Congress counted the electoral votes on January 6th. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=68.16s)]
*  Giuliani and his allies coordinated the nuts and bolts of the process on a state by state [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=72.72s)]
*  level. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=77.4s)]
*  The Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=78.4s)]
*  They secured meeting rooms in state houses for the fake electors to meet on December [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=81.5s)]
*  13th, 2020. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=85.84s)]
*  They circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=86.84s)]
*  Archives. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  Behind the scenes, Giuliani and Trump campaign officials actively choreographed the process. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=93.64s)]
*  The Washington Post and their piece on this today also has this important new piece of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  news. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Quote, Vice President Pence's chief of staff, Mark Short, tells the Post that Rudy Giuliani [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  and his associates forwarded to Pence's office letters arguing the Trump electors should [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=111.7s)]
*  be recognized in these states that Biden had in fact won. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=119.06s)]
*  Mr. Short and Pence's legal team reviewed the unsolicited letters but were not persuaded [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=123.98s)]
*  there was any legal basis to accept Trump electors who had not been certified by their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=128.86s)]
*  states. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=134.06s)]
*  So Rudy Giuliani and associates directly conveyed to Vice President Pence and his staff that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=135.82s)]
*  Pence should count the fake ones, should open the forged fake elector counts and count those [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=144.18s)]
*  instead of the real ones when it came time to tally up the electoral college results [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=151.18s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  And per today's reporting, Mr. Giuliani also led the effort at a nuts and bolts level to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=157.62s)]
*  create those fake forged elector slates in the first place, including distributing the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=165.18s)]
*  drafts of the fake certificates that were ultimately sent in to the Congress and the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=170.94s)]
*  National Archives. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQflkl29VMM&t=175.46s)]
