# 'Wildly unconstitutional': GOP flagged Trump's election scheme in private, Cheney book reveals
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4)
*  It's also valuable to have a conservative Republican member of Congress writing about something we can't see from the outside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=0.0s)]
*  What's going on among? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=6.24s)]
*  Conservative Republicans behind closed doors while they're giving in to this anti-democratic plot [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=8.16s)]
*  We learned for example on page 124 of Liz Cheney's new book that a senior Republican staffer on the Rules Committee [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=14.0s)]
*  Wrote in the Republican staff memo on impeachment less than a week after the January 6th attack on Congress. This is the Republican staff memo [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=20.56s)]
*  The person wrote that Trump had committed impeachable offenses calling what Trump did quote a serious act political in nature [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  That corrupted or subverted the political process and threatened the order of political society [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  That's the Republican staff memo on impeachment after January 6th [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  previously unreported [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=46.8s)]
*  We learn on page 74 that the day before January 6th [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=48.68s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy's general counsel the top lawyer for the top Republican in the house [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Told congressman Mike Johnson that the effort he was organizing to get House Republicans to sign on to Trump's effort to overthrow the election [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=57.18s)]
*  Was an effort that was wildly unconstitutional in its basis quote later that night [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  I heard from Kevin McCarthy's chief counsel Michaela Carr. She told me she had made clear to Mike Johnson that his letter was wrong [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=70.86s)]
*  She said that he knew it was she said he pushed back very strongly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=78.34s)]
*  Excuse me. She said she pushed back very strongly when they discussed it that afternoon and then Cheney quotes from an email [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=82.78s)]
*  He knows he is wrong on the fundamental constitutional principle and his argument that he has some sort of power to individually determine [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  Absent due process of any sort that a state didn't meet their constitutional obligation and then that the remedy should be that without any process [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=97.1s)]
*  whatsoever the federal cross federal Congress gets to overturn the will of the people is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=104.46s)]
*  Astonishing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=109.7s)]
*  Astonishing that's the top lawyer serving the top Republican in the house [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=112.82s)]
*  Telling him that what he's doing is unconstitutional as he's doing it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=119.1s)]
*  Mike Johnson, of course is now no longer just an anonymous backbench member of Congress. He's now the leader [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=124.22s)]
*  He's now the Republican speaker of the house [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=129.78s)]
*  page 32 of her book Liz Cheney describes communications with senior Republican staffers in the on Capitol Hill [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=132.26s)]
*  About the court filing that Mike Johnson in fact led as part of Trump's election challenge [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=139.02s)]
*  Concluding that he might personally have ethical issues as a lawyer as in with his professional accreditation [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=144.28s)]
*  For having made factual assertions to the court in that brief about things. He didn't actually have factually in from factual information about [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=151.46s)]
*  As you know [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=160.94s)]
*  Lots of Trump lawyers have faced professional punishment for lies [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=161.78s)]
*  They told on Trump's behalf after the election Liz Cheney in her new book effectively asserts that the house speaker Mike Johnson [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=165.1s)]
*  Might be one of those lawyers [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b083rALQt4&t=171.9s)]
