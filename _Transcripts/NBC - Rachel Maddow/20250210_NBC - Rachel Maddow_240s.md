# For 'co-President' Musk, early days of Trump are already paying off
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo)
*  Amid everything, did you notice the little announcement that the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=0.0s)]
*  has ordered a halt to all federal funding for electric vehicle chargers across the United [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=5.36s)]
*  States? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=11.58s)]
*  EV charging stations? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=12.58s)]
*  You might think that would be a problem for Trump's billionaire co-president, his largest [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=15.06s)]
*  campaign donor, Elon Musk, who runs the electric car company, Tesla. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=20.22s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=24.32s)]
*  There's a reason he's not complaining quite the contrary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=25.32s)]
*  And it's because Elon Musk's company, Tesla, already has the biggest private charging network [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=29.08s)]
*  in the country, bigger than all of his competitors. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=35.32s)]
*  So as he posted on his social media site last year, quote, take away the subsidies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=38.56s)]
*  It will only help Tesla. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=44.16s)]
*  Well now Donald Trump has done just that, leaving Tesla unchallenged as the largest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  EV charging network in the country, with no one really having any chance to catch up to them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Then there's one of Musk's other companies, SpaceX, a huge government contractor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=59.04s)]
*  Back in December, the New York Times reported that the Defense Department's inspector general [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=63.16s)]
*  had opened a review into SpaceX for potentially violating rules about keeping sensitive government [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=67.28s)]
*  secrets out of the hands of our foreign adversaries. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=73.0s)]
*  Elon Musk's own foreign travel and his contacts with foreign governments had reportedly not [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=77.16s)]
*  been disclosed regularly to the U.S. government, which not only impeded his own security clearance, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=82.28s)]
*  but also reportedly led, in part at least, to this inspector general's security review [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=87.56s)]
*  of potential national security risks surrounding his companies and specifically him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=93.28s)]
*  Well, when Donald Trump took office, he fired that inspector general conducting that review, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=100.08s)]
*  along with 17 other inspectors general across the government. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=107.36s)]
*  Then there's Elon Musk's social media company, formerly known as Twitter. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=111.84s)]
*  When Elon Musk took over that company, one of his goals was to turn it into a digital payment company. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=116.48s)]
*  He wanted everybody to start using Twitter the way they used Zelle or Venmo to send money electronically. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Starting this year, he announced a big new plan to do that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=130.04s)]
*  But you know, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government regulator that makes [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=132.64s)]
*  sure credit card companies and banks can't charge you junk fees or unnecessarily hike [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=137.12s)]
*  up your interest rates and screw you over that way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=142.2s)]
*  The CFPB also regulates the kinds of digital money transfers that Elon Musk now wants to do at Twitter. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=145.0s)]
*  And as Lever News points out today, the CFPB has just been finalizing new rules for that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=152.6s)]
*  kind of payment system. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=157.88s)]
*  When over the weekend, huh, they got shut down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=160.4s)]
*  Musk and the Trump administration shut the CFPB down entirely. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=164.24s)]
*  So if you voted for Trump because you thought banks and credit card companies are the good guys, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=168.8s)]
*  and they need more opportunities to screw people over on small print scams and junk fees [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=174.8s)]
*  and ballooning credit card interest rates and all the rest. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, if so, today must feel great. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=182.52s)]
*  Must feel like you got a lot for your vote. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  The pushback against Trump's efforts to defund the police, to defund the financial police has begun. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  In earnest, lawsuits have been filed already challenging Trump's shutdown of the CFPB. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Today in Washington, protesters and lawmakers, look at this, turned out again in the street, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=202.48s)]
*  rallied in support of CFPB and its workers outside of its headquarters. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=207.92s)]
*  This was today in Washington, people showing up in person and Democratic lawmakers showing up there to support them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pS0DqGMxTo&t=212.88s)]
