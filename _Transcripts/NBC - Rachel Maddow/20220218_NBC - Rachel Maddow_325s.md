Video Description: Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney, explains a judge's ruling that Donald Trump was acting as a failed candidate, not as a president, when he incited the January 6th riot, and may therefore be subject to civil lawsuits like those already filed by several members of Congress as well as the discovery process that goes with them.

# Trump The Failed Candidate Lacks The Privilege Of Trump The President; Can Be Sued: Judge
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM)
*  Today we got an important ruling in three civil cases, a dozen members of Congress and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=0.0s)]
*  multiple Capitol police officers brought against Donald Trump and others for their role in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=5.08s)]
*  inciting the insurrection on January 6th. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=10.24s)]
*  A federal judge in D.C. denied President Trump's efforts to dismiss those lawsuits. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=13.96s)]
*  In his 112-page ruling, the judge said the evidence suggests that Trump assembled the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=19.6s)]
*  crowd and then instructed the rallygoers to march on the Capitol despite knowing that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=24.76s)]
*  the crowd likely included violent and destructive elements. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=29.84s)]
*  The judge's decision to keep the cases alive leaves Trump and his inner circle vulnerable [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=33.86s)]
*  to more depositions and document requests. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  But importantly, the decision also declares Trump potentially financially liable for conduct [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=42.0s)]
*  while he was the sitting president, which the judge acknowledged was a rare and momentous [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  legal decision. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=53.28s)]
*  So not only does this open the possibility that the president will have to pay damages [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=54.92s)]
*  against cold, hard cash to the people who allege he hurt them by inciting January 6th, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=58.96s)]
*  but it also sets the precedent that Trump could be liable for any of his conduct while [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=65.64s)]
*  he was the sitting president if that conduct was really about his reelection and not about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=70.36s)]
*  his actual duties as president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=75.4s)]
*  It is a lot to unpack. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=77.6s)]
*  Joining us now is Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for spending time with us and helping us along this journey. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  Let's start with the decision today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  The judge is denying the president immunity from civil damages while he was a sitting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=92.52s)]
*  president. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=96.88s)]
*  Are we right to see that as a potentially really significant development here? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=103.32s)]
*  This is a brand new ground that has been broken here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=104.86s)]
*  Ordinarily, the president gets immunity for any action he takes while he's president, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  and that is seen as necessary to give him comfort that he can do things that might be [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=113.86s)]
*  unpopular and very difficult. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=118.02s)]
*  But what the judge said here is that when Donald Trump was standing out there in the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=120.18s)]
*  ellipse on January 6th, he was not acting in his capacity as president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=123.9s)]
*  He was acting in his capacity as a failed candidate for president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=128.54s)]
*  He was talking about his complaints about the election, and for that reason, the judge [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=132.94s)]
*  said he was not entitled to the kind of immunity he would ordinarily enjoy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=137.7s)]
*  And he's potentially personally financially liable here, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=142.18s)]
*  Am I correct in thinking that this could end up costing President Trump money from his [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=146.82s)]
*  own pocket? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  He would have to take out his personal checkbook and potentially pay damages to Pramila Jayapal [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=154.58s)]
*  and Eric Swalwell and the Capitol police officers who brought this case? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=164.62s)]
*  You know, we've been hearing earlier in the week about his finances and how he inflated [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=165.62s)]
*  some of his assets. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  We don't know whether it was $5 billion or $8 billion that he had, but we may soon find [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=171.98s)]
*  out if he has to write some big checks here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  And I think sometimes people diminish the role of civil law as compared to criminal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  law when holding people accountable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=182.78s)]
*  But you know, for some people, like Donald Trump, hitting them in their pocketbook can [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=185.5s)]
*  be a very powerful message that is punitive to him, but also provides some compensation [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=188.54s)]
*  for the harm, the pain, the suffering, the death, the destruction that occurred on January [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=194.88s)]
*  6th. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=199.62s)]
*  The important thing about civil liability is sometimes that is the best way to right [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  a wrong, because the legal standard there, rather than in a criminal case where you have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=204.94s)]
*  to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt, in a civil case, you only have to prove a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=209.66s)]
*  case by a preponderance of the evidence. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=213.9s)]
*  So it explains the kind of thing where you get an acquittal in a case against O.J. Simpson, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  for example, but then he is found liable in the civil case because that legal standard [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=220.9s)]
*  is different. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  And so while it may be difficult to hold Donald Trump accountable criminally, it could be [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  that it's the civil case that finally does so. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=230.54s)]
*  What about the materials involved when we're talking about civil cases, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=233.18s)]
*  In terms of the former president's vulnerability to subpoenas and document requests in this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  case, is there a difference between what a civil prosecutor can get access to compared [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=241.62s)]
*  to what a criminal prosecutor could get access to as it pertains to all of this? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, they're different. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=253.1s)]
*  You don't have the grand jury to work with when you're a civil litigator. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=255.12s)]
*  The way a criminal prosecutor does. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  And that can have a lot of power in building an investigation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=262.04s)]
*  And so ordinarily in the civil case, as long as you have a well-pled complaint and you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=265.2s)]
*  have investigated your legal theories, you can go forward and then uncover the facts [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=270.24s)]
*  as the case proceeds. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=274.48s)]
*  And that's what we might see happen in this case. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=276.0s)]
*  Today's decision opens the opportunity now for that civil discovery to take place. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=278.64s)]
*  So the noticing of depositions, the request for documents. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  Today's effort was very much the motion that was filed that was decided today was an effort [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=287.96s)]
*  to stop it, nip this case in the bud before we go down that path of civil discovery. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=291.88s)]
*  Now that that motion has been rejected, that opens the floodgates for depositions and document [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=297.08s)]
*  requests. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=302.2s)]
*  And so I imagine we will see that in the coming months. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iqAk1wLaOM&t=303.2s)]
