# Brazilian President Puts Records Of Moscow Trip Under Seal For Five Years
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw)
*  Back in February, just a week before Putin started his war against Ukraine, the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=0.0s)]
*  of Brazil, the very Trumpy president of Brazil, flew to Russia, spent three days in Moscow, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  and obviously met with Putin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=15.16s)]
*  After his Putin meetings on that trip, the president of Brazil made some headlines for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=17.1s)]
*  saying that his country, Brazil, was, quote, in solidarity with Russia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=23.2s)]
*  Now, again, keep in mind the timing here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=28.72s)]
*  This is February this year. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=30.52s)]
*  This was a time when the whole world was on tenterhooks, expecting that Putin was about [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=32.26s)]
*  to start a big war and invade Ukraine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=36.68s)]
*  And there's Brazil's president hopping into Putin's proverbial lap. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=40.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=44.72s)]
*  He goes to Moscow, does this big three-day official trip to Moscow, has this big meeting, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=45.72s)]
*  this big photo op with Putin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  He denied that Putin would launch any war in Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=52.76s)]
*  For good measure, he explained how Brazil was closer than ever to Russia. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=56.54s)]
*  Don't worry, world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=60.94s)]
*  Putin's great. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=61.94s)]
*  He's not going to do anything bad. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=62.94s)]
*  He's my guy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=64.3s)]
*  One week later, of course, Putin invaded Ukraine, which was awkward for the Brazilian president. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=67.14s)]
*  But now today, Brazil's president has decided that he will handle that very embarrassing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=73.7s)]
*  turn of events the way I'm sure we all wish we could. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=78.92s)]
*  He has decided that he will dump it down the memory hole and close the door on it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=83.22s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president today, decreed that all public records concerning [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=88.86s)]
*  that very bad timing three-day official trip he took to Moscow right before Putin launched [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=95.2s)]
*  his war, all public records of that will now be sealed for at least five years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=100.98s)]
*  So even though he went to Moscow and told everybody that Putin was going to start no [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=108.82s)]
*  war and that Brazil stood with Russia, no one is allowed to know what happened on that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  trip or nobody's even allowed to know who else was traveling with Bolsonaro on that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  trip until at least 2027. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=123.63999999999999s)]
*  The records have been sealed for five years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=127.08s)]
*  And just like that, you know, he's assuming it will all be forgotten. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=131.28s)]
*  Maybe it will be. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJv4dI_XjPw&t=136.07999999999998s)]
