# Video Recordings Of Proud Boys Meetings Likely To Help Prosecutors
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk)
*  Now I mentioned there might be more videotape tomorrow than we were otherwise expecting for your typical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=0.0s)]
*  criminal conspiracy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=7.28s)]
*  Part of the reason I think we should be sort of ready for that tomorrow [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=9.0s)]
*  Is because of this which we recently saw from the New York Times [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=13.68s)]
*  All right, so what time is the whole political presidential situation happening that day with that I don't know [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=18.6s)]
*  I guess we're just gonna have to I mean a lot of the questions are coming in about DC [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=25.0s)]
*  You'll haven't formulated a plan for DC yet because we've been trying to form. I mean we somewhat know we just we just there's there's a lot of detailed information [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=30.04s)]
*  I guess we got to go over but yes, we will have a plan for DC [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=37.96s)]
*  Why is there tape of that? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=42.72s)]
*  Apparently the proud boys pro-trump paramilitary group [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=45.88s)]
*  recorded [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=49.68s)]
*  Their video conference calls, which is the venue they chose for making their plans for Washington DC on January 6th [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=51.0s)]
*  The plan for the whole political presidential situation happening that day with Pence [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=59.36s)]
*  This is the part where Stringer Bell says are you taking notes on a freaking criminal conspiracy? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=65.72s)]
*  What are you thinking? I? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=70.76s)]
*  Mean I have no advanced knowledge as to what the January 6th investigators have gotten what they don't but Alan Foyer at the New York Times [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=72.76s)]
*  Reported last month that the proud boys paramilitary group not only recorded their video planning sessions for January 6th [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=80.8s)]
*  But at least one of the recordings was seized from the phone of the group's leader by the FBI [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=87.8s)]
*  This year in 2022 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=94.44s)]
*  Quote and a copy was recently obtained by the Times. So these big brains in this pro-trump fascist group [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  First of all decided to do their organizing on video conference. Hmm, then they made recordings of those planning sessions [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=104.72s)]
*  Which is amazing then their leader guy [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=113.0s)]
*  Kept the recordings for at least a year after the Capitol attack [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=117.88s)]
*  He duh then had them seized by the FBI and also they have made their way to at least one reporter who was able to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=124.8s)]
*  publish pieces of them at the New York Times [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=132.52s)]
*  So yeah, like I said, I don't know exactly what the January 6th investigation has but it's got to be a help to have [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=135.56s)]
*  Guys like this right in the middle of your criminal conspiracy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=143.44s)]
*  I mean you pray in investigations of all kinds for targets like this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=147.44s)]
*  Did you literally leave breadcrumbs to I? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Mean that's why the leadership of both of these pro-trump armed fascist groups are about to be put on trial for sedition part [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=155.24s)]
*  Of the way you're able to put somebody on trial for a crime that serious is when they lay out and make records [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  of everything they've done [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=169.64s)]
*  Oh [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRNQAAQjdzk&t=172.44s)]
