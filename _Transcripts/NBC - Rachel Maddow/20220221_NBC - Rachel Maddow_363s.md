# Putin Narrative To Excuse Ukraine Invasion Rings Hollow To Experts And Observers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY)
*  Joining us now is Anne Applebaum, the staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of Twilight of Democracy, the seductive lure of authoritarianism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=0.0s)]
*  Ms. Applebaum, thank you for being with us tonight. You are an important voice to give us some clarity on what's going on, because Vladimir Putin is trying to convince the world of a narrative that you know not to be true. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=8.0s)]
*  Ukraine has had a sense of itself as a nation, as an ethnic group, as an identity for many centuries. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=20.0s)]
*  Ukraine was a colony. Many Ukrainians were serfs. They were slaves, in fact. Ukraine's national poet was born as a serf and later on bought his freedom when he moved to St. Petersburg. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=28.0s)]
*  It's a nation that has always had a sense of itself being opposed to the nobility, the aristocracy, the empire. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=41.0s)]
*  Its identity was always very closely connected to rebellion, sometimes in an anarchical sense, but sometimes often in a positive sense. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=51.0s)]
*  Ukrainians made several attempts to become independent. At the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, there was very briefly a Ukrainian state. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=60.0s)]
*  They then lost a war with the Red Army, with the Bolsheviks, but even in the early days of the Soviet Union, the Bolsheviks knew that Ukraine national identity had to be acknowledged and accounted for, and Ukraine had to have its own republic as a federation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=69.0s)]
*  But Ukraine was always a challenge. It was a challenge for the unity of the Bolsheviks, of the Soviet Union. They always had a different sense of themselves. They were more westward-looking. They talked about democracy even back then. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=88.0s)]
*  And from the very beginning, Stalin sought to destroy them. They were, Stalin organized an artificial famine in Ukraine that killed nearly four million people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=101.0s)]
*  Fast forward that story today. Ukraine remains a problem for Putin because Ukraine aspires to democracy. It aspires to sovereignty. It doesn't want to be part of a new Russian empire. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=113.0s)]
*  And that's a challenge to Putin's version of autocracy, kleptocracy, the idea that only he is in charge and only he decides about everything around him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=125.0s)]
*  We're watching the development of a very old historical argument, and Putin's use of this, as I said, historical nonsense is just designed to cloud the picture. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=134.0s)]
*  In 1938, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with Adolf Hitler, cut a deal that was thought to avoid what ended up being World War II. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=145.0s)]
*  You wrote something in the Atlantic yesterday in which you said, there are no Chamberlains in this story, but there are no Churchills either, and Ukraine will fight alone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=156.0s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=166.0s)]
*  So the West is not blinded by what's going on. I think the Biden administration has done brilliantly in its constant anticipation of what's going to happen and its revelation of intelligence. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=168.0s)]
*  The Vice President made an excellent speech in Munich where I was a couple of days ago, bringing allies together. Other allies have shown solidarity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=181.0s)]
*  I think once they agreed on what will trigger the sanctions, I think the sanctions will be real. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=190.0s)]
*  There's been real military help for Ukraine, and yet there is a line drawn as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=196.0s)]
*  We know that there aren't going to be any Western troops in Ukraine. We know there are limits on what will be done for Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=202.0s)]
*  Part of that is because Russia has nuclear weapons. Part of it's because people fear escalation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=210.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's going to be the Ukrainians and their bravery and their dedication to this very old idea, the idea of sovereignty, the idea of freedom. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=215.0s)]
*  It'll be their dedication to that that determines what happens. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=226.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has made the argument publicly that the West has cornered him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=229.0s)]
*  I'm going to put up that NATO map again to show what NATO looks like today, that the West had some sort of agreement that they would not get that close to Russia and that that's what this is all about, that they need a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=234.0s)]
*  One can see that picture there, that Ukraine is a non-NATO country and it is a bulwark between Eastern Europe and Russia. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=247.0s)]
*  That's not really true. This isn't really about Ukraine and NATO, is it? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=254.0s)]
*  No, it's really not about Ukraine. In fact, a few days ago, the German chancellor was in Moscow and he essentially said, look, as long as I'm chancellor, Ukraine will never be a NATO. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=259.0s)]
*  So he essentially made that promise that had no impact. That's really not what this is about. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=268.0s)]
*  It's not about Ukraine being a NATO. It's about Ukraine being, as I said, a sovereign democracy that doesn't want to be part of the Russian Empire and whose democracy challenges the idea of autocracy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=273.0s)]
*  I mean, look, if Ukraine can be a successful democracy, and maybe someday it will be, that's a challenge to Putin's system. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=284.0s)]
*  His argument is, I'm the only answer for Russia. Only a system like mine can run Russia. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=291.0s)]
*  But Ukraine is close to Russia historically and geographically and culturally. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=297.0s)]
*  And if Ukraine can be a democracy, then Russians will look at it and say, well, we could have that as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=301.0s)]
*  The use of NATO as a and the retrospective conversation about NATO and remembering things that weren't said at the time and trying to bring this into the conversation is really just a way of manufacturing an excuse. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=307.0s)]
*  Putin has wanted to occupy Ukraine and destroy Ukrainian democracy ever since 2014. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=319.0s)]
*  And that's really what's going on here. It's not. NATO is a secondary issue. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=325.0s)]
*  And we don't do justice to the amount of research and time you've spent on this, but I appreciate the time that you have given us tonight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=331.0s)]
*  And I would recommend that our viewers follow your writings and Applebaum is a staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=337.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAeFCD-WuEY&t=361.0s)]
