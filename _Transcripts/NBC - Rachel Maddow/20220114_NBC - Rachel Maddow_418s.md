# Crush Of Covid On U.S. Hospitals Calls For 'Thinking Outside Of Dogma' For Solutions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo)
*  I want you to take a look at this photo for a minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=0.0s)]
*  It is of some nurses who work at a hospital in Palm Springs, California, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=3.2s)]
*  and those sheets of paper they are holding up are called assignment despite objection forms. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=8.2s)]
*  Nurses submit those forms to their hospital's management when they have been given an assignment that they feel is unsafe. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  And just look at this for a minute. Look how many of those nurses, you know, from that one hospital are holding up right there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=21.5s)]
*  And these are nurses from the National Nurses United Organization, the nation's largest nursing union, holding a memorial in front of the White House just last night. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=29.5s)]
*  And they say every one of those candles represents a nurse who has died from COVID since the pandemic began. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=39.7s)]
*  Yesterday, nurses from hospitals all across the country gathered in front of their workplaces and they protested. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=46.5s)]
*  At two years into this pandemic, they say they are fed up of being overworked, understaffed, exhausted and forced to work in unsafe conditions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=52.6s)]
*  On Sunday, the U.S. passed its previous record number of patients hospitalized with COVID nationwide. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=61.1s)]
*  But the number we really have to look at is hospital capacity, not just the amount of sick patients going in, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=66.7s)]
*  but how that number compares to how many patients our hospitals and our health care system can actually take care of. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=74.2s)]
*  Yesterday, at least 80 percent of the staffed hospital beds were occupied in 24 states, nearing capacity in almost half of the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=80.5s)]
*  In 18 states, more than 85 percent of the staffed ICU beds were full. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=89.3s)]
*  I say the word staffed here because the staff is the key in all of this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=95.3s)]
*  Yesterday, President Biden announced the deployment of 120 military medical personnel to help overwhelmed hospitals in six of the hardest hit states. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=100.4s)]
*  That is in addition to hundreds of military and federal emergency personnel that have been deployed since Thanksgiving, we should note. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=108.8s)]
*  And today, FEMA expanded how federal funding for National Guard members can be used in those hospitals. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  The idea is that since most National Guard members are not doctors, this funding will allow governors to send their National Guard members into hospitals to pick up slack in other ways, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  like doing laundry and delivering meals, critical, critical parts of hospital operations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=131.8s)]
*  We got a glimmer of hope this week as cities in the Northeast where the U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=137.1s)]
*  first got hit by Omicron showed signs that the wave may be plateauing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=141.6s)]
*  That is great news and may mean that this wave is a lot shorter than previous ones. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=147.5s)]
*  But right now, our nation's medical workers need backup. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=152.2s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=156.6s)]
*  Vangupta, critical care pulmonologist and assistant professor at the University of Washington and a major in the U.S. Air Force Medical Reserve Corps. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=158.0s)]
*  He spent this past weekend on a medical mission moving critically ill patients, I should note, around the country with the Air Force Reserves and spent this past week in the ICU in Seattle at the University of Washington. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=165.0s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, all I can say is I thank you for making time for us and spending time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=175.9s)]
*  I know it's your night off, so thank you for spending a little bit of that with us here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=181.2s)]
*  Can you help Dr. Gupta? Can you help us understand what this staffing shortage looks like on the ground from where you've been? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=185.1s)]
*  What positions are most understaffed or overworked? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, Amy, good evening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=196.0s)]
*  Typically what's happening across hospitals in every single zip code is that we don't have enough support staff, much less docs, but support staff to run at full senses. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  So even though we might have enough beds in an ICU and ventilators, that was all the hot rage back in March of 2020. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=207.2s)]
*  Now we just don't have enough respiratory therapists or ICU nurses. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=213.6s)]
*  And so that is causing a pinch here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=217.1s)]
*  So at 60% capacity or 75% capacity in terms of bed availability, that's when we have to close down. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=218.9s)]
*  We're not filling necessarily all the beds with patients in any given ICU. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=225.5s)]
*  And this is symptomatic what you're seeing across the country, Amy, which is why we need FEMA, which is why we need DOD assets to do the mission and to really be deployed for something we previously have not done in uniform. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  Talk to me about the short term here for a moment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=243.0s)]
*  What more can the US government do to help support hospital staff through this through this way? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=244.9s)]
*  Because as you mentioned, you know, back in 2020, it was about getting ventilators. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=250.0s)]
*  What can they do now? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, I would say that the one lever that they haven't pulled that in my belief they should pull is they should reimagine what our current military can do. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=256.1s)]
*  Yes, it's great to have National Guard do operational tasks in hospitals, but I'm part of the critical care air transport team for the Air Force. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=263.3s)]
*  Probably a hundred such teams both across the reserve and active duty. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=270.6s)]
*  And what we do is a team of doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=274.6s)]
*  We move patients at 30,000 feet. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=278.8s)]
*  But if we really reimagine the mission here that is not moving patients wounded warriors from Bagram to Walter Reed, but perhaps actually helping to expand hospital capacity in a field ICU field tent ICU wherever there's stressed ICUs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=281.3s)]
*  We could do that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=295.5s)]
*  We could staff a 10 to 12 bed ICU in a tent in a place that doesn't have that capacity. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=296.4s)]
*  So it's reimagining the assets, how they can be used that we already have at our disposal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=302.0s)]
*  But it really requires thinking outside of dogma and really rethinking the mission as it is. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=306.9s)]
*  And that hasn't happened yet. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=313.4s)]
*  I want to go back to something you said in the first response. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=315.5s)]
*  And that is more about the long term about our country's doctors and nurses because you're looking at this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=318.4s)]
*  And obviously hospital staff are now being worked into, I guess, you know, our third year of a multi-year pandemic. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=323.5s)]
*  There's no clear end in sight. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=330.3s)]
*  What should we be doing to make sure that our hospitals, our next generation of doctors are both well staffed and that those staff are taken care of as we look into the future? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=332.2s)]
*  You know, there's a variety of potential solutions that we just don't talk enough about. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=343.2s)]
*  So thank you for bringing it up. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=347.5s)]
*  We could increase funded residents lease slots for docs. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=349.2s)]
*  There's more docs that want to be docs that just can't get through training because we don't have enough training slots for them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=353.0s)]
*  There's more nursing applicants that want to be nurses, all types of nurses that we actually have nursing school slots for. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=358.3s)]
*  That is a travesty, especially given the supply demand shortage that we're going to see. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=364.2s)]
*  I mean, there's a balance imbalance that's going to get worse by 2030. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=368.6s)]
*  Forty percent of nurses, thirty percent docs are estimated to leave the workforce by the end of the decade. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=371.7s)]
*  That's a big problem. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  Do what the UK does aim in, which is allow for more options to go directly from high school to health care, vocational school, mitigating debt. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=378.3s)]
*  That's a big problem here. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=386.5s)]
*  So I think we need to think outside the box here and embrace solutions that we historically had not been willing to do. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=388.0s)]
*  The pandemic is forcing those decisions to be made in real time. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE3I3qnD_Vo&t=393.90000000000003s)]
