# Alex Jones Shows Signs Of Panic As Accountability Looms
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI)
*  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year, in a year or two years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=6.88s)]
*  Let's give me a little bit of time to run things. But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=11.84s)]
*  I remember that interview. He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=17.6s)]
*  That was then candidate Donald Trump praising the right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in an [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=21.04s)]
*  interview on Jones's Infowars show as a presidential candidate back in 2015. At the time, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  Alex Jones was three years into his vile attacks on the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=34.64s)]
*  school shooting, where 26 people, including 20 kids, were shot dead in their classrooms. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=40.4s)]
*  And he was getting rich doing it. Trump didn't care. Over the next three years, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=46.48s)]
*  Alex Jones's online store would rake in more than $50 million annually, selling body armor [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=50.4s)]
*  and dietary supplements, and his website saw an average of 1.4 million visits daily. That interview [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=55.76s)]
*  was one of candidate Donald Trump's earliest experiments in normalizing and promoting dangerous [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  far-right conspiracy theorists. It served as a dark warning sign of where American politics [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=67.92s)]
*  would eventually and quickly end up. One of our two political parties has been so willing to condone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=72.56s)]
*  and tolerate fringe conspiracy theories that Trump's followers attempted a coup against the seat of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=78.0s)]
*  American government, a fact conveniently and regularly forgotten or excused by the party's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=83.36s)]
*  leaders. But that moment is also a reminder that even the most influential conspiracy theorists [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=88.16s)]
*  can be beaten. Nearly seven years later, Donald Trump is still the de facto leader of the Republican [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=92.88s)]
*  Party, but Alex Jones is on the brink of ruin thanks to a series of defamation lawsuits brought [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=98.0s)]
*  by the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. Thanks to that, Alex Jones now finds [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=103.28s)]
*  himself liable for millions of dollars in damages. His companies are now trying to declare bankruptcy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=108.56s)]
*  in a desperate attempt to prevent the fortune he made pushing lies and diet supplements from being [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=114.0s)]
*  seized. In a hearing today in a Texas bankruptcy court, Jones's lawyers made references to free [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=119.52s)]
*  speech, to deplatforming and even to Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter to try and paint Jones and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=124.64s)]
*  his businesses as victims of the so-called woke mob. None of that seems to have helped him. The [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=130.32s)]
*  judge overseeing the case said he could make a decision on Alex Jones's bankruptcy ploy as soon [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=135.76s)]
*  as next month. But perhaps there's no better example of just how far Alex Jones has fallen [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=140.56s)]
*  than the fact that he is now begging for help from the dreaded deep state he spent so many years [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=145.36s)]
*  railing against. Last week, Jones formally reached out to the Justice Department to try and get an [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=150.56s)]
*  immunity deal in exchange for cooperating with the department's investigation into January the 6th. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=155.28s)]
*  Jones was in DC on the 6th. Two people familiar with the matter told New York Times reporter [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=160.4s)]
*  Elizabeth Williamson this week that such an immunity deal is unlikely to materialize, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=164.96s)]
*  leaving Alex Jones out in the cold. No one, not the Justice Department, the bankruptcy courts or even [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=170.16s)]
*  the former president appear eager to hand him a lifeline. So what does that mean for Alex Jones? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=176.0s)]
*  And is his case a model for how to push back against the peddlers of disinformation in the present [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=180.48s)]
*  age? Joining me now is New York Times reporter Elizabeth Williamson, who has been covering Alex [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=186.48s)]
*  Jones's legal troubles. She's also author of the recent book Sandy Hook, An American Tragedy and the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=191.92s)]
*  Battle for Truth. Thanks so much for joining us tonight. Walk me through what Alex Jones's situation [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=196.56s)]
*  is here and how much money he might potentially have to pay out to these Sandy Hook families in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=202.64s)]
*  the end. Sure, Maddie. So I think what's happening here is, you know, the bankruptcy idea is a way to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=207.27999999999997s)]
*  avoid the jury trial. So late last year, Alex Jones was found liable in four separate defamation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  suits filed by the Sandy Hook families. That was because he so obstructed the discovery process in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  the run up to trial that the judges found him liable by default. So that means that this year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=228.96s)]
*  and it was supposed to begin this week, juries would meet to decide how much he must pay the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=236.0s)]
*  Sandy Hook families in damages. The bankruptcy filing was filed exactly one week before those [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=241.84s)]
*  trials were seen by the Justice Department's bankruptcy court overseer and the Sandy Hook [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  families lawyers as a ploy to delay these jury trials for damages, which, as you point out, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=256.8s)]
*  could correctly cost him millions of dollars and potentially his business. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=263.36s)]
*  And the other part of this puzzle, of course, the whole DOJ angle. What should we make of Jones's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  attempts to cooperate with the Biden Justice Department? Does he think that will help him [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=273.12s)]
*  with his bankruptcy case? Does he implicitly accept he has some liability when it comes to January the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=276.88s)]
*  6th? I think these are two separate issues which have one thing in common, and that's that he is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=281.44s)]
*  seeking protection from the government, which he maligns daily on his show. I think he sees himself [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=288.64s)]
*  as under threat. And, you know, in the Justice Department investigation into the January 6th [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=295.04s)]
*  insurrection, he has been subpoenaed by the House and he's reached out to offer a deal for immunity [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=302.0s)]
*  from prosecution to justice in exchange for his testimony. This probably isn't going to fly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=308.88s)]
*  partly because he may not know much. So that's one issue. And then the separate is, as we discussed, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=315.84s)]
*  the bankruptcy case in which he's seeking protection from a federal bankruptcy court [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=321.92s)]
*  for his business. It's a very unusual bankruptcy filing in that Alex Jones himself hasn't filed for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=329.36s)]
*  bankruptcy, just these sort of shell companies. It's an effort to ask the, or sort of force the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=336.4s)]
*  Sandy Hook families into a $10 million settlement, which is, you know, saying that he doesn't have [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  the finances to do anything further. But this is someone who's made a half billion dollars in [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=350.88s)]
*  revenues from the time of the Sandy Hook shooting to the present. Wow. And last quick question on [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  that. He's made a lot of money and he has a big reach. Donald Trump went on his show. Matt Gates [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=362.96s)]
*  went on his show. Jones got White House credentials at one point, press credentials during the Trump [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=367.76s)]
*  era. He was mainstreamed and normalized, this hate monger, this purveyor of anti-Semitism, this bully [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  of families by top people in the Republican Party, wasn't he? Yes. And the issue there is that there [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=378.79999999999995s)]
*  is a segment of Alex Jones's audience that was a very valuable constituency for former President [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=388.08s)]
*  Trump. That is the group of people, conspiracy minded, but deeply distrustful of the government, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=395.52s)]
*  who put him over the top in the presidential election in 2016. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=402.32s)]
*  Yes, they did. New York Times writer Elizabeth Williams. And thank you so much for your time [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=407.76s)]
*  and your analysis tonight. Appreciate it. Sure thing, Mehdi. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lsKkrDxHJI&t=411.6s)]
