# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8)
*  I mean, if you're done with politics and you just want to be in charge forever by force, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=0.0s)]
*  then no one can be allowed to contest the leader or to question the leader. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=7.0s)]
*  Importantly, nobody can be allowed to offer any alternative source of authority to the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=11.32s)]
*  leader. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=16.52s)]
*  So there can't be journalists who know stuff and report it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=17.88s)]
*  There of course can't be opposition politicians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=22.04s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=24.0s)]
*  There can't ever be anyone who runs against him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=25.88s)]
*  That would mean taking your life in your hands. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=28.04s)]
*  There can't be law enforcement that does anything independent of what the leader wants. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  The whole government has to work entirely for the leader. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=34.24s)]
*  There's no government providing information and services like we're used to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=37.56s)]
*  There's no state. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=42.08s)]
*  There's just the deep state, which is terrible and evil and against the leader and it must [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=43.16s)]
*  be purged, replaced just with people he likes and who do what he wants. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=47.28s)]
*  The government cannot have a civil service that has subject matter experts because everybody [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=53.76s)]
*  has to work only for the leader. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=59.82s)]
*  We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=67.68s)]
*  humanity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  In the Trump era, in the Republican Party, this is what it's like to be the nation's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=77.12s)]
*  most esteemed public health official, the nation's top subject matter expert on infectious [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=82.48s)]
*  disease. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci was the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  for 38 years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=93.92s)]
*  He has a new book that's out tomorrow. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=96.5s)]
*  It's called On Call, a Doctor's Journey in Public Service. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=97.92s)]
*  In that book, he says that in the quote, early days of the HIV AIDS pandemic, the aggressive [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=100.84s)]
*  hate mail that he got was quote, homophobically motivated, criticizing me for wasting time [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=106.0s)]
*  trying to save mostly gay men who quote, brought this all on themselves by their supposedly [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=111.56s)]
*  aberrant behavior. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=117.56s)]
*  With Ebola, he says, the hate mail seemed to be related to the perception by white supremacist [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=118.56s)]
*  types that I favored black Africans over the health of our country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=124.32s)]
*  So that's the kind of hate mail he got in the AIDS era. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=130.74s)]
*  That's the kind of hate mail that he got in the Ebola era. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=132.96s)]
*  But in this era, in response to our most recent infectious disease threat, in the context [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=135.24s)]
*  of the Trump movement on the American political right, now the torrent of hate and threat [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=140.68s)]
*  is of a different order and a different magnitude. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=148.68s)]
*  It needs to be dealt with. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=150.88s)]
*  The criminal gang leaders, the big heads of the central banks, the Pfizer head, Fauci, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  all of them that lied to Trump, we know, created the disinfo, already had the vaccine ready [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=161.84s)]
*  years before they released the virus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=166.84s)]
*  They all need to go to prison for the rest of their lives. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=169.56s)]
*  It is the right thing to do that they be executed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=171.56s)]
*  I'm not a wimp. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  I will volunteer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  I think it should be public. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  I will pull the lever. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't have a bloodlust, but I don't want people to do work I wouldn't do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  Dr. Fauci's new book, he tells the story of his decades in public service, serving seven [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  different presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan, helping lead the response not only [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  to HIV and AIDS domestically and around the globe, but also to Ebola and also Zika and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=193.66000000000003s)]
*  also SARS and also even the anthrax attacks after 9 11. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=198.76s)]
*  It's a 450 page book. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=202.6s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=204.84s)]
*  As I mentioned, it is fascinating. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=205.84s)]
*  Every new crisis is a detective story and a science thriller and a political potboiler [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=207.56s)]
*  all rolled into one. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=213.32s)]
*  But the last hundred pages or so are about the COVID crisis and also about serving, trying [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  to handle the COVID crisis under the most recent Republican president. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Under Donald Trump. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  And even though that part of Dr. Fauci's career in public service is over, he retired in 2022 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  after serving as President Biden's chief medical adviser. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=235.88s)]
*  Even though he is now out of public service after all of these decades, the Trump movement [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  and its members in Congress and its supporters in the media are still going after Dr. Fauci [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=243.04s)]
*  as aggressively as ever, if not more so, even two years after he left government. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  Because he epitomizes one of the things they are trying to destroy, one of the things that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=256.32s)]
*  they need to destroy in their revolutionary war against the American system of government. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=261.28s)]
*  It is not that they disagree with him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  It is not that they misunderstand. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=270.76s)]
*  It is that he represents expertise. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=274.08s)]
*  Authority. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=277.44s)]
*  Earned by expertise. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=280.44s)]
*  The way we use, the way we sort of shorthand that in life is that he is a person who knows [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  what he is talking about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  And that of course is toxic for their political project. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  That cannot be allowed to stand. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=292.88s)]
*  And so he is still in the bullseye for them, even now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=295.28s)]
*  This is from the book. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=298.08s)]
*  This is from August of 2020. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  He says, quote, I had been absent for work for a few days because I had a benign polyp [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=301.28s)]
*  removed from one of my vocal cords. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  I was just getting back into the swing of things, happy to be sitting at my desk in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=307.52s)]
*  my office going through mail that had piled up. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  It was about 1030 a.m. when I picked up a letter off of one of the stacks. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=312.84s)]
*  The envelope bore a Jacksonville, Florida return address. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=316.64s)]
*  It was typewritten in an unusual font but otherwise looked like the fan mail that I [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  got every day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=324.4s)]
*  Most of the time people asked me to sign a baseball card or an index card. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=326.0s)]
*  Sometimes occasionally he says, quote, they told me they hated me. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=329.2s)]
*  I opened the top of the envelope with a letter opener and took out a single sheet of folded [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  white paper. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=337.84s)]
*  As I unfolded it, fine white powder shot up from the paper and drifted down onto my face, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  my tie, my shirt, my hands, my pants, my desk and my chair. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=344.84s)]
*  I instantly feared anthrax or worse. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  I immediately shouted to my assistant, Kim, do not come into my office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=353.08s)]
*  Go get George and Brett, my security detail who were posted down the hall. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=357.2s)]
*  They sprinted to the doorway of my office, yelling, don't move, stay where you are, don't [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=362.12s)]
*  come out because you will contaminate everything else. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=366.44s)]
*  Following their instructions, I put the letter and envelope into a plastic bag for forensics. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=368.96s)]
*  George called the NIH hazmat team who came to my office in their spacesuits. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=373.32s)]
*  They had me remove all of my clothes, which also went into a plastic bag, and they sprayed [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=378.04s)]
*  me down with chemical foam. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=382.56s)]
*  I thought, this is insane. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=384.36s)]
*  There I was standing naked, being sprayed down by guys in spacesuits. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=386.32s)]
*  My fate hinged on a call giving me a preliminary analysis of the powder. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=391.68s)]
*  There were three possibilities. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=395.6s)]
*  It was a hoax and merely a harmless powder. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  It was anthrax spores, and I would require four weeks of the antibiotic Cipro, but would [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  probably survive. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  Or it was ricin, and no matter what I did, I would be dead in a few days. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  Ricin, which is formed from the seeds of castor beans, is lethal when inhaled or injected. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=410.44s)]
*  Christine, Dr. Fauci's wife, and our daughters were terrified that I might die. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=415.48s)]
*  Jenny was also furious, which was probably a reflection of her fear and concern for me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=421.16s)]
*  Megan and Allie called multiple times asking, Dad, are you all right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=425.8s)]
*  Are you all right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=428.68s)]
*  They all dreaded that I might say I was starting to feel sick. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=429.68s)]
*  My own emotions were complicated. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  I felt like a complete idiot for opening what in retrospect was a suspicious letter, and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  I was fatalistic about the outcome. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=439.24s)]

*  I do not fear death, but I was not ready to leave this earth yet, not by a long shot. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=457.24s)]
*  It should go without saying that this should not be something that happens in the life [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=462.16s)]

*  Dr. Fauci's book explains the government's response, the challenge of dealing with a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=477.28s)]
*  literally novel coronavirus, something new, learning as we go. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=481.76s)]
*  He also tells the story of trying to build a government response with a president who [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=487.28s)]
*  literally did not understand what was going on in some very fundamental ways, who told [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  him, told Dr. Fauci, for example, that he didn't understand why he would get a flu [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=497.92s)]
*  shot if he did not have the flu, as if he did not understand the difference between [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=502.64s)]
*  a treatment and a vaccine. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  A president who asked why the flu vaccine couldn't just be used to prevent COVID, as [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  if he didn't understand that diseases and viruses are different from one another. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=515.52s)]
*  A president who believed a Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, when she told him that there [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=520.16s)]
*  was a secret miracle cure for COVID. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=524.8s)]
*  A president who didn't understand how clinical studies disproving that had any more validity [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=528.32s)]
*  than what had been heard on the grapevine from someone he saw on the Fox News who had [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=533.52s)]
*  no subject matter expertise. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  And it got worse from there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=541.72s)]
*  This is also from Dr. Fauci's book. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=544.32s)]
*  On April 22nd, I attended a task force meeting where we were briefed by William N. Bryan, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=546.0s)]
*  acting Undersecretary for Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=550.84s)]
*  Bryan explained two studies that showed how sunlight and humidity could kill the virus [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=555.32s)]
*  and substances such as isopropyl alcohol and disinfectants could be used effectively to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  clean non-porous surfaces. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=564.84s)]
*  The following day, he briefed the president in the Oval Office on these studies without [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=567.72s)]
*  Deborah Birx or me being present. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  He then joined the president on the podium in the briefing room. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  The result was the infamous press conference where Donald Trump appeared to endorse using [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=578.24s)]
*  bleach as a way to disinfect the lungs from COVID. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=582.36s)]
*  The president told the press, the White House press corps quote, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=586.36s)]
*  Then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=594.2s)]
*  Because you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=599.52s)]
*  So it would be interesting to check that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=603.0s)]
*  Dr. Fauci says, I was not at that day's press briefing, but as I watched it on TV, I thought [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=605.6s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=612.32s)]
*  Poor Deb, meaning Deborah Birx being on stage with the president during that musing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=615.7600000000001s)]
*  She must have been horrified and given her military background, it would have been difficult [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=619.5200000000001s)]
*  for her to contradict the commander in chief, especially publicly. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=623.12s)]
*  She looked as if she wanted to be any place other in the world, but there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=626.84s)]
*  Sitting in front of the television, I knew we were going to have people who heard that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=632.7600000000001s)]
*  from the president and would then go ahead and try it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=635.88s)]
*  My phone immediately exploded with texts and calls asking me to comment. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=639.08s)]
*  I instantly realized that I and other scientists had to counter this message to keep Americans [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=643.32s)]
*  from ingesting bleach, which could literally kill them. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=648.84s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci is in the bullseye of the Trump movement to this day as they seek to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=653.2s)]
*  return to power. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=658.84s)]
*  He's in the bullseye of the Trump movement even after leaving the government. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=661.72s)]
*  And it is not because of COVID and it is not because of the controversial and difficult [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=665.6s)]
*  decisions of this most recent epidemic threat that he helped the country face down. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=669.32s)]
*  He has faced down plenty of those in his 54 years at NIH. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=673.76s)]
*  What he's facing now is a political movement that cannot abide public health expertise [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=679.28s)]
*  at all because it cannot abide expertise at all because that competes with the truths [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=684.52s)]
*  that are spouted from the head of the leader. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  It is a movement that cannot abide authority and expertise from anyone other than their [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=695.88s)]
*  leader. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=702.12s)]
*  And they answer any such competition for him with menace. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=703.54s)]
*  And it's not romantic and it may be revolutionary, but there's nothing sexy or dramatic or lovely [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=710.4s)]
*  about it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=717.4s)]
*  It is boring, it is violent, and it's about using force. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=718.4s)]
*  And it's a war against the U.S. system of government. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=722.72s)]
*  We're living through an era in our country's political life right now, which is not politics. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  And if you want to call it the most romantic possible thing, I think you could call it [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=735.24s)]
*  revolutionary, right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=739.16s)]
*  Just like gangsterism is a familiar trope for us in our favorite American drama, we [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=740.9599999999999s)]
*  also romanticize revolution and revolutionaries as much as any country on earth. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=744.88s)]
*  But what we are contending with in our politics right now is a movement that is not doing [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=750.68s)]
*  normal politics and is not competing in normal political terms. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=756.74s)]
*  They're trying to end the American system of government. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=761.0s)]
*  They're trying to bring about a revolution against the American system of government [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=763.22s)]
*  and against the United States of America. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=767.28s)]
*  And in this story, we're the Americans. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=769.4s)]
*  So yes, being revolutionary sounds very cool in the abstract. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=771.98s)]
*  Just like being gangster sounds very cool in the abstract. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=777.64s)]
*  But in the specific, what they're actually offering is boring because it's just gross [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=781.88s)]
*  force. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=788.7s)]
*  It's the end of politics. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=791.7s)]
*  Let's just do it by force. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=793.62s)]
*  Because physically, we mean it just the way we say we're saying it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=795.94s)]
*  We mean it just the way you're hearing it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=800.86s)]
*  We are where we're coming for you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=802.58s)]
*  So brother, you and all the other people, the tortures, these are torturous conversations [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=805.78s)]
*  we're having. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=809.92s)]
*  Don't torture yourself. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=810.92s)]
*  Don't torture yourself. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=812.62s)]
*  Get your passport. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=814.0600000000001s)]
*  Get the hell out of the country because hey, we're coming. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=815.0600000000001s)]
*  And guess what, bro? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=816.66s)]
*  You ain't going to like it one bit. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=817.66s)]
*  Your crimes and your treason, Comey, all of you go ahead. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=819.12s)]
*  Go to the ends of the earth. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=825.02s)]
*  We will hunt you down and bring you back. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=826.34s)]

*  It's a family of feral dogs. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=847.14s)]
*  We're going to have to fumigate the lies of Joe Biden, the treason of Joe Biden and how [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=849.86s)]
*  enfeebled he is. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=854.78s)]

*  It's very simple. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=914.42s)]

*  This isn't retribution, right? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=925.46s)]
*  This is retribution as much as Tony Soprano's dad was providing protection to the local butcher. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=927.66s)]
*  This is not a response to anything. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=934.5s)]
*  What this is is just menace and physical threat, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=937.96s)]
*  It's not politics. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=941.92s)]
*  It's just power. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=942.92s)]

*  We're going to salt the earth and we're just going to hunt you down. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=958.5400000000001s)]
*  And this is not some random right-wing media guy. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=963.24s)]
*  This is the man who was the campaign manager for Donald Trump and also the senior White [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=965.72s)]
*  House advisor to the former president who is now their nominee again. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=971.0s)]
*  And it is, it's not like he's the only one who's saying this thing. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=975.52s)]
*  This is what they are offering the American public and they love it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=978.3s)]
*  They're super excited to be getting, you know, done with politics, getting right to the force [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=983.32s)]
*  and violence part of it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=987.94s)]
*  The next six months is going to be intense and we need to strap on our, let's see, what [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=990.32s)]
*  do we want to strap on? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=997.32s)]
*  We're going to strap on our seatbelt. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=998.6400000000001s)]
*  We're going to put on our helmet or your Kerry Lake ball cap. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1001.6400000000001s)]
*  We are going to put on the armor of God. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1007.72s)]
*  And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of a prison case. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1015.72s)]
*  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1020.72s)]
*  We will route the fake news media and we will liberate America from these villains once [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  and for all. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1032.1200000000001s)]
*  Don't you think for a second he's not going to unleash hell on all of his political enemies? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  This is where we are and now we have to finish it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1038.84s)]
*  You have to finish it once and for all. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1041.96s)]
*  They keep saying things like that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1045.88s)]
*  Once and for all. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  Finish it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1048.1200000000001s)]
*  Vanquish them. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  This is not politics. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  In a political contest, you compete against your fellow citizens with whom you have political [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1051.32s)]
*  disagreements, the rival political party, whoever loses that fair race concedes, literally [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  concedes, and then they come back. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1063.6s)]
*  They have the opportunity to come back in the next election cycle and compete against [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1065.52s)]
*  you again. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1069.28s)]
*  In real politics, nothing's ever finished. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1071.6s)]
*  You never take power once and for all. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  Your enemies are not vanquished. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1075.96s)]
*  But they are not trying to win a political contest. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1079.68s)]
*  They are trying to do away with political contests in the United States of America, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1081.88s)]
*  which might be why they're not putting much energy into the normal way of competing in [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1086.5600000000002s)]
*  this year's political contest. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1090.2s)]
*  You may have seen this weekend, former president went to Detroit, which of course seems like [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1091.88s)]
*  a normal thing for a political candidate to do. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1096.2s)]
*  Big city and a big swing state. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1098.6000000000001s)]
*  And he went to a black church trying to appeal to a demographic where he has room to grow. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1100.48s)]
*  But he goes to this black church in Detroit and his campaign does not take any steps to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1105.04s)]
*  avoid the pews being completely filled with white people, with white Trump supporters. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1109.24s)]
*  Then on the day, the message of his supposed campaign is that he's trying to appeal to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1114.64s)]
*  black voters, right? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1118.8s)]
*  That's the whole point of doing this photo op. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1120.24s)]
*  He then goes straight from that venue stuffed with white people to a conference hosted by [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1122.72s)]
*  this guy who has been in the news for the last few months for saying, quote, We made [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1128.36s)]
*  a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s, saying that he thinks black [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1133.14s)]
*  people are not qualified to be airline pilots, that he worries if he's on a flight and sees [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1138.3s)]
*  that the pilot is black, who has been posting things like, quote, whiteness is great on [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1143.5s)]
*  social media, who has been hosting guests on his podcast to talk about how black people [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1148.78s)]
*  are inherently biologically inferior and incapable of advanced intelligence. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1153.18s)]
*  Someone who said literally MLK, meaning Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1160.22s)]
*  He wrote MLK was awful, not a good person. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1164.46s)]
*  So on the day your campaign message is, Hey, black voters, look at me. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1169.82s)]
*  Aren't I appealing? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1174.06s)]
*  Going from the black church that's inexplicably full of white people right to right from there [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1175.28s)]
*  to go be with to go do an appearance with the MLK was awful and the Civil Rights Act [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1181.66s)]
*  was a mistake guy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1186.74s)]
*  If that's how you're running your campaign, you are not trying very hard in normal campaign [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1188.7s)]
*  terms, but they are not trying very hard in normal campaign terms. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1193.5s)]
*  They're trying. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1197.26s)]
*  They're not trying very hard to compete on normal political appeals. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1198.7s)]
*  What they are trying to do instead is take power by menacing and chasing out of the country [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1202.82s)]
*  anyone who opposes their leader. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1208.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1210.66s)]
*  Destroy anyone who contradicts him. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1211.66s)]
*  Let you know, let alone anyone who deigns to compete against him. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uFAK5E6FL8&t=1213.62s)]
