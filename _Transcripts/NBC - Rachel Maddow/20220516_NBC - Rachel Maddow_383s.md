# Reporters Tread Carefully With Attention-Seeking Racists, Extremist Online Communities
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM)
*  Joining us now is Ben Collins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=0.0s)]
*  He's an NBC News reporter who covers disinformation, extremism and the internet. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=2.6s)]
*  Ben, I'm really glad you were able to be here tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=6.2s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=8.32s)]
*  Thank you, Brad. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=9.32s)]
*  So you cover disinformation and extremism for a living. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I just want to ask you bluntly, and it's OK if the answer here is no, is the tension [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=15.68s)]
*  that I'm feeling here real and warranted, this tension between understanding the extremism [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=20.8s)]
*  that's at work here while also desiring not to spread it, not to popularize it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=27.46s)]
*  It's a very real tension, and it's something that I fight with personally while doing this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=32.9s)]
*  job. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=36.54s)]
*  So I did all Saturday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=37.54s)]
*  I was thinking, how do I make sure people understand what's in this manifesto and also [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=38.54s)]
*  understand mostly that this man is not alone in thinking this, that he's part of a community [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  of people who want to murder people without trying to spread that message? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=48.18s)]
*  And it's really difficult. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=53.18s)]
*  I spent the last day or two just looking through his Discord chats that he has posted to a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  diary since December. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=62.58s)]
*  And it's incredibly and deeply chilling. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=65.78s)]
*  The idea that he had was he was going to go to the supermarket instead of a church or [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=69.78s)]
*  a school, which he thought about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=74.9s)]
*  He thought about going to a school down the street because he deduced that there were [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=76.9s)]
*  more Black children in that school because he thought they didn't test as well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=81.02s)]
*  It's how racist this man was. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=85.82s)]
*  But he decided instead to go to the supermarket because he wanted to make sure every Black [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=88.38s)]
*  person feared for their life everywhere they went. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  And I don't really know how to say that to people without quoting him in that way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=97.62s)]
*  But it is the tension that we have and just avoiding it now or, you know, taking those [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=103.58s)]
*  ideas that he has and try to moderate them a little bit, which is what, frankly, Tucker [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  Carlson tries to do. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=117.66s)]
*  That's irresponsible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=120.3s)]
*  I don't have solutions for this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  I think people have talked today about banning 4chan or something or, you know, blaming Twitch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=123.34s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=129.18s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=130.7s)]
*  If you were to ban 4chan, these people would use a VPN and get around it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  There's a website that is based in Japan. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=136.06s)]
*  There's not a lot of jurisdiction there for us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  People will find a way to get to 4chan. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=140.78s)]
*  They want to get to 4chan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=142.62s)]
*  There is a civic responsibility, though, to not take their ideas and take the murder out of it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=144.62s)]
*  and say it's legitimate political discourse on the highest rated cable news show [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=151.82s)]
*  or not to run on that as a political platform. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  And I don't know how to make people stop doing that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=160.86s)]
*  But instead of stopping, they are absconding from responsibility. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=163.98s)]
*  Ben, what happens to these manifestos that get published online or even the live streams [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=171.26s)]
*  of the killings, which we saw this weekend in Buffalo and we saw previously in Christchurch [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=178.86s)]
*  and in other terrorist attacks like this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=183.02s)]
*  How do those things live online? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=186.62s)]
*  How do they function? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=188.78s)]
*  And do they accomplish what the killers want, which is to both spread and popularize [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=189.74s)]
*  the ideas that motivate them and also to radicalize and galvanize to action [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=198.14s)]
*  the other people who already believe them? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=202.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=205.18s)]
*  This man had a very specific plan on what to do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=205.98s)]
*  He posted it in his manifesto and then he did it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=208.7s)]
*  He outlined what he was going to do once he got his camera on his head to go inside [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=212.62s)]
*  to make it look like a first person shooter video game. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=218.94s)]
*  What he was going to do was he was going to post a link to the manifesto, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=222.3s)]
*  a link to his Twitch stream to people who he had previously interacted with on Discord. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=225.58s)]
*  On Discord, you don't have to talk about anything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  Usually people talk about video games, just a place to chat on the internet, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  especially if you're a teenager. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  But anyone who's interacted with him got this message. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=236.22000000000003s)]
*  Some people who had nothing to do with extremist politics. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=238.46s)]
*  And it was saying that he was about to go to the supermarket to kill all these people. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=241.74s)]
*  And here was basically just a series of diaries since December of him planning out this attack. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=244.78s)]
*  From there, people on 4chan started to watch this in real time on Twitch. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=251.10000000000002s)]
*  And some of those people started to archive this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=254.78s)]
*  And that's how we even know that these videos exist, is that some of the bad guys, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=258.14s)]
*  or some of the people who interact with these people and at least knew the ins and outs of 4chan, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  started posting it there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=266.86s)]
*  And that's why this is a problem. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=268.7s)]
*  This is decentralized. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=270.54s)]
*  This is something that happened on an Amazon-owned company's servers, Twitch, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=271.58s)]
*  which tried to take this down in real time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=276.06s)]
*  Then it was spread to 4chan, then it was spread to other bad websites. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  There was an HN knockoff. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=281.18s)]
*  HN itself is dead, but somebody took the branding and created a different 8chan website. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  This is not something that you can stop. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  This is something, if somebody wants to do it, they can get it out there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  And they realized, too, that the next person to do this, because they don't think they're the last, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=293.26s)]
*  will include their name in the next manifesto. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=297.34s)]
*  That manifesto is a recitation of everyone else's previous talking points. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=301.82s)]
*  It's literature to them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=308.14s)]
*  And they build on it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=309.5s)]
*  In fact, there is the spookiest part about this, I would say to me, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=311.02s)]
*  is that the format is pretty set now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  You go and you write something at the top about white replacement, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=318.54s)]
*  pretty much the same thing as the last guy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=320.86s)]
*  And then you do a Q&A with yourself to figure out why it's happening. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=322.78s)]
*  Then you list your ammo, drop a bunch of 4chan memes that inspire you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=326.14s)]
*  It's no different than the last one. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=330.14s)]
*  Actually, a nerd to it at this point, Rachel. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=331.82s)]
*  But it is, unfortunately, a set thing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=335.5s)]
*  They have figured out exactly the formats for white nationalist terror manifestos. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=339.5s)]
*  Ben Collins covers disinformation, extremism and the internet for NBC News, which is a very, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  very difficult beat, difficult in terms of its toll on people who have to cover it every day [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=351.82s)]
*  and what you have to see. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  Ben, thank you for what you do. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=358.3s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=359.18s)]
*  Thanks for the time, Rachel. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=361.5s)]
*  Thanks for watching. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTm6AGcjeMM&t=368.86s)]
