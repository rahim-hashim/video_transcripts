# Voting Rights Advocates Press Hard Line For Biden
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU)
*  King's family plans to celebrate the holiday with a march to keep pressure on the Senate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=0.0s)]
*  to pass the For the People and the John Lewis Voting Rights Acts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=4.96s)]
*  But Martin Luther King Jr.'s son, Martin Luther King III, has stressed, quote, no celebration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=9.84s)]
*  without legislation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are facing pressure from other quarters [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=17.88s)]
*  to do more than offer forceful remarks on protecting the right to vote. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=21.92s)]
*  On Tuesday, the president and vice president will visit Atlanta to talk about voting rights [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=26.5s)]
*  and efforts by Georgia Republicans to limit voting access in that state. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=30.62s)]
*  But ahead of their arrival, a coalition of voting rights groups have released a statement [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=35.7s)]
*  essentially saying, don't come to Atlanta without a plan to pass voting laws. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=40.22s)]
*  Quote, Georgia voters made history and made their voices heard, overcoming obstacles, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=45.86s)]
*  laws to deliver the White House and the United States Senate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=53.02s)]
*  In return, a visit has been forced on them, requiring them to accept political platitudes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  and repetitious bland promises. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=63.02s)]
*  Such an empty gesture without concrete action, without signs of real tangible work is unacceptable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=66.14s)]
*  As civil rights leaders and advocates, we reject any visit by President Biden that does [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=73.5s)]
*  not include an announcement of a finalized voting rights plan that will pass both chambers, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=78.84s)]
*  not be stopped by the filibuster, and be signed into law. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=85.44s)]
*  Anything less is insufficient and unwelcome. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=89.56s)]
*  End quote. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=93.44s)]
*  Joining us now, Nse Ufot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=94.44s)]
*  She's the chair, the CEO of the New Georgia Project, which is one of the groups that signed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=95.94s)]
*  onto that letter. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=100.4s)]
*  Nse, good to see you again. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=101.76s)]
*  Thank you for being here tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  That is a forceful letter. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=104.68s)]
*  I'm curious about what you think the reaction will be and what you'd like the president [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=108.08s)]
*  and the vice president to be able to do to meet the standards that are set out in that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  request. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=117.88s)]
*  Well, I will say that some of the earlier reactions have been quite visceral. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=118.88s)]
*  I think that people think that we are being harsh or sharp in our critique. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=127.28s)]
*  But what our intent is and what I think is happening is that we are creating the demand, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=134.04s)]
*  right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=139.0s)]
*  So that there is no doubt that on this historic visit where we have not only the president [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=140.0s)]
*  of the United States, but also our vice president coming to this historic place, the cradle [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=145.4s)]
*  of the civil rights movement, of the American civil rights movement here, our great state [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=151.56s)]
*  of Georgia, to talk about how our democracy, how our elections infrastructure is being [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=155.0s)]
*  attacked. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=162.0s)]
*  They should hear from activists and organizers and ordinary Georgians on the ground about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=163.0s)]
*  what they would like to see from this visit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=168.52s)]
*  So again, some people might frame it as a harsh criticism. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=171.92s)]
*  I absolutely see it as articulating the demand from their base. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=175.64s)]
*  So now what happens when the president and the vice president say, as they have said, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=180.6s)]
*  we're on your side on this thing, we fully agree with you, there's no policy difference [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=186.12s)]
*  between what you and your fellow groups have done in Georgia and what you want done and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=189.32s)]
*  when what the president wants done. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  But how do you propose or do you not propose that he get to that in terms of getting something [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=195.56s)]
*  that looks like a plan that can pass when we say both houses of Congress, we really [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=202.0s)]
*  mean the Senate because we were able to pass it through the House and overcome the filibuster. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  What is it you're asking specifically to be done? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=210.68s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=213.28s)]
*  So Senator Schumer has already laid the plans, has articulated his ambitions to have a rule [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=215.64s)]
*  change vote on the 17th commemorating the birth of Martin Luther King. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=222.77999999999997s)]
*  What I will say is, listen, I haven't served in that body for four decades, but I know [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  someone who has and that's our president of the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=234.56s)]
*  And so my it is our hope that with his 40 years of experience with his Senate colleagues [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  and the bully pulpit that comes with being the president of the United States, right, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=243.68s)]
*  that together he can work with the leaders in the Senate to articulate what the plan [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  is, what a path forward is. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Or if there is no plan, if Republicans have so thoroughly abat advocated their responsibility [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=255.44000000000003s)]
*  to govern that there's no path forward, I think the American people need to hear that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=262.24s)]
*  I want to talk about some of the very specific things to some people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=267.92s)]
*  This is an abstraction. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=270.6s)]
*  If you have never stood in a line to vote or you don't have problems registering to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  vote or your polling place is very close to you and you don't need transportation and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=275.32000000000005s)]
*  you're able to take time off from work, this is an abstraction. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  In Georgia, advocates, I just want to read this to our viewers. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=283.6s)]
*  Right now, advocates and local leaders are fighting to stop the closure of seven out [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=286.8s)]
*  of eight polling places in Lincoln County, where over one third of the voters are black. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=290.48s)]
*  Just next week, the state legislature will convene with Republican leaders already proudly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  touting their plans to attack voting access, push to ban drop boxes and erect new hurdles [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=300.24s)]
*  in the path of voters. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=305.72s)]
*  This is very, very practical for you and your organization and for voters in Georgia. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  It is literal physical impediments to people voting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  This is not an academic discussion. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=320.8s)]
*  Right. We are not sitting on our dorm room floor debating democracy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=322.92s)]
*  Like what is happening? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  This is an active threat in real time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=329.68s)]
*  Our Republican leaders in Georgia and federally have not stuttered not once. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  They are unified. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=338.56s)]
*  This is a well-funded attack. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  And we are not just talking about Georgia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=342.52s)]
*  We're not just talking about red states. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=345.24s)]
*  I will not shut up about the fact that 400 anti-voting bills were introduced in nearly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=347.52s)]
*  every state in our country in the 10 months, in the 11 months since legislative sessions [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=354.96s)]
*  started again in 2021. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=362.56s)]
*  They are not playing. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=365.04s)]
*  And I don't understand why people are not acting with a sense of urgency. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=367.76s)]
*  There are tons of things in the president's domestic policy agenda and in the foreign [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=373.84s)]
*  policy agenda that we absolutely need passed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=379.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=382.48s)]
*  The Build Back Better bill is brilliant. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=382.96s)]
*  The changes to infrastructure, the expansion of the definition of infrastructure to include [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=385.36s)]
*  our frontline workers, our service workers, the human capital, the people that make our [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=390.32s)]
*  country continue to run and that have kept us safe. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=394.48s)]
*  All of that is necessary. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=397.12s)]
*  All of that is important. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=398.32s)]
*  And none of that will happen if we are not able to secure people's participation in our [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=399.52s)]
*  elections. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=405.04s)]
*  And I'm talking about rural counties in Georgia. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=405.92s)]
*  And we're talking about counties in California as well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=409.2s)]
*  You underscore the most important point here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=412.96s)]
*  Thanks again for being with us and for the work you do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=414.96s)]
*  And Seyufot is the CEO of the New Georgia Project. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us tonight. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKjpx8S2EU&t=420.24s)]
