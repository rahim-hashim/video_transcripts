# Another Keystone Pipeline Oil Leak Proves Activist Opponents Correct
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM)
*  So they did this thing where they carried around a big prop pipeline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=0.0s)]
*  You might remember these images. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Here it was in front of the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=5.92s)]
*  See the big pipeline, the big black pipeline? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=7.76s)]
*  Here it was in New York City. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=10.42s)]
*  For years, you'll remember this movement. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=13.22s)]
*  It was a big, well-organized, aggressively creative campaign to protest Keystone, the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=15.68s)]
*  expansion of the Keystone pipeline, which funneled tar sands oil out of Canada and across [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=21.56s)]
*  the United States. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  Keystone's the most famous pipeline on the continent, specifically because of the movement [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=27.74s)]
*  to stop it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=31.7s)]
*  And the activists' argument against, particularly the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, was twofold. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=33.42s)]
*  And they said first, at this point in the climate crisis, we should be leaving tar sands [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=39.98s)]
*  oil in the ground, not building new funnels to help bring that stuff to market and burn [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=43.3s)]
*  it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=48.26s)]
*  But it was also a full-throated argument about how pipelines are not great at what they're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=49.8s)]
*  supposed to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  Anti-Keystone activists raised the alarm about how, for all the money in the oil industry, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=56.26s)]
*  even brand-new modern oil pipelines like to leak. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=62.42s)]
*  So first of all, keep the oil in the ground. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=68.34s)]
*  And if you don't do that and you put the oil in the pipeline, prepare for disastrous [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=71.9s)]
*  oil spills. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  That was the argument from the anti-Keystone activists. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=77.34s)]
*  Well, what do you know? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=80.18s)]
*  Last week, the Keystone pipeline sprung a leak in Kansas the size of an Olympic swimming [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=83.42s)]
*  pool. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=88.22s)]
*  Close to 600,000 gallons of oil dumped out of the pipeline and into a nearby creek and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=89.56s)]
*  into some rural pasture land. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=95.72s)]
*  It was the biggest oil spill on land in the United States in more than nine years. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=97.28s)]
*  And this is not the first time the Keystone pipeline has ruptured, not by a long shot, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=102.98s)]
*  including the spill from this past few days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=107.38s)]
*  This one pipeline, the Keystone pipeline, has sprung a leak 23 times in the last 12 [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=109.68s)]
*  years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=116.04s)]
*  And the leaks are getting bigger as they go. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=117.18s)]
*  More oil burst out of the pipeline in Kansas this past week than in all the previous 22 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  spills combined. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=124.48s)]
*  Keystone has now officially soaked the United States in more spilled oil than any other [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=126.76s)]
*  pipeline in the last decade. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=131.8s)]
*  Since it first got up and running in 2010, the Keystone pipeline has spilled so much [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=134.0s)]
*  oil that if you scooped up all of it and put it all in one gallon milk jugs, that line [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=138.52s)]
*  of milk jugs would stretch all the way from New York City to Philadelphia and beyond. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=144.72s)]
*  The company that runs the pipeline says with this new spill in Kansas, they say they're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=152.12s)]
*  totally sure there's no threat to drinking water at all. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=155.42s)]
*  It's all going to be fine. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=158.76s)]
*  They say they've put out all the state of the art technologies to stop the spill from [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=160.28s)]
*  spreading further downstream and maybe even someday clean it up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=164.44s)]
*  To be clear, the state of the art when it comes to cleaning up oil spills is pretty [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=169.2s)]
*  much what you might invent if you were a particularly unimaginative second grader thinking about [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=172.6s)]
*  things like this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=177.8s)]
*  Cleaning up oil spills still looks like it did in the 60s. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=179.0s)]
*  It's like sections of boom and big paper towel thingies and sometimes vacuum trucks to try [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=181.96s)]
*  to slurp it up and dump it somewhere else. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=188.4s)]
*  Lobbying for oil drilling and for things like pipelines that spew oil all over Kansas, that's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=192.76s)]
*  actually the state of the art in the oil industry. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  That's like their Ferrari. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=200.4s)]
*  Cleaning up their spills, that technology is still very much their Model T Ford. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=202.32s)]
*  It's not like their priority for research and development is figuring out how to clean [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=207.2s)]
*  up when they spill. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=211.92s)]
*  The company that operates Keystone says they still don't know what caused this latest, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=214.92s)]
*  biggest spill. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=218.64s)]
*  It was all a big surprise to them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=219.64s)]
*  It wasn't a surprise to everyone though. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSoNQemIgM&t=221.64s)]
