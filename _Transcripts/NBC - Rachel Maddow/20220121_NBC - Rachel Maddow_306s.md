# DOJ Task Force Brings First Charges For Threats Against Election Workers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM)
*  Starting in June of last year, journalists at Reuters began publishing a series of hair-raising reports about threats and harassment of election workers across the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=0.0s)]
*  They focused in particular on the state of Georgia, in large part because that was where Donald Trump's election lies were particularly focused. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=9.0s)]
*  Reuters reported in detail threats and harassment against Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and his wife, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=17.0s)]
*  after Raffensperger refused to bow to Trump's pressure to overturn Joe Biden's win there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=25.0s)]
*  Weeks after the first Reuters report, the Justice Department announced it was launching a special task force dedicated to threats against election workers, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=30.0s)]
*  saying, quote, a threat to any election official, worker or volunteer is a threat to democracy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=38.0s)]
*  Well, it has been almost six months since that task force was announced, but today it filed its first charges. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=45.0s)]
*  A Texas man was indicted today for threatening election and government officials in Georgia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=52.0s)]
*  The indictment does not name the officials this man threatened to kill, referring to them as officials A, B and C. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=58.0s)]
*  According to the indictment, this man posted a message to Craigslist on January the 5th last year, titled, quote, Georgia Patriot, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=64.0s)]
*  It's time to kill official A, the Chinese agent. $10,000. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=71.0s)]
*  I guess the $10,000 was what he was offering to pay to have that official killed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=76.0s)]
*  He then goes on to talk about putting bullets in three Georgia officials, calling them treasonous traitors. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=82.0s)]
*  As I said, we do not know who the election officials are that this man threatened. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=88.0s)]
*  As for the weird stuff about one Georgia election official being a Chinese agent, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=92.0s)]
*  Obviously, there were all kinds of conspiracy theories being pushed by the Trump campaign about foreign countries, including China, tampering with the vote count. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=97.0s)]
*  But I will also mention that just a few days before this threat was posted, then President Trump accused Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of hiding all the supposed election fraud because his brother worked for China. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=106.0s)]
*  A conspiracy theory that managed to gain traction, despite the fact that not only did Brad Raffensperger not have a brother who worked for China, Brad Raffensperger does not have a brother. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=118.0s)]
*  So this guy in Texas has been charged for these threats. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=129.0s)]
*  The first case from this Justice Department task force to combat threats against election workers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=132.0s)]
*  It's a start, but, you know, it's strangely fitting that the first charge for threatening elections officials should come out of Georgia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=137.0s)]
*  Georgia really has been ground zero for harassment of election workers because it's been ground zero for Donald Trump's campaign to overturn the 2020 election and undermine the administration of elections for the next time around. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=145.0s)]
*  I mean, this guy in Texas didn't wake up one morning and decide he would randomly threaten to kill elections officials in Georgia. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=158.0s)]
*  Sorry, he did not think of it on his own. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=165.0s)]
*  A pressure campaign against elections officials has consequences. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=168.0s)]
*  Consequences that were warned about all the way back in December 2020 by Georgia's top elections administrator, a Republican. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=172.0s)]
*  You may remember this moment. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=180.0s)]
*  I'm going to do my best to keep it together. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=183.0s)]
*  Because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=187.0s)]
*  it has all gone too far. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=191.0s)]
*  All of it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=198.0s)]
*  The straw that broke the camel's back today is again this 20 year old contractor for a voting system company just trying to do his job. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=199.0s)]
*  His family's getting harassed now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=207.0s)]
*  There's a noose out there with his name on it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=209.0s)]
*  It's not right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=212.0s)]
*  This kid took a job. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=213.0s)]
*  He just took a job. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=216.0s)]
*  And it's just wrong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=219.0s)]
*  I can't begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=222.0s)]
*  And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike should have that same level of anger. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=227.0s)]
*  Mr. President, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=236.0s)]
*  it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=239.0s)]
*  We're investigating. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=242.0s)]
*  There's always a possibility. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=243.0s)]
*  I get it. You have the rights to go through the courts. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=244.0s)]
*  What you don't have the ability to do and you need to step up and say this is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=246.0s)]
*  Someone's going to get hurt. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=252.0s)]
*  Someone's going to get shot. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=254.0s)]
*  Someone's going to get killed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=255.0s)]
*  And it's not right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=258.0s)]
*  It was clear all the way back in December 2020 that the campaign of pressure and harassment against elections officials by Donald Trump and his allies was producing a campaign of threats and harassment against elections officials [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=260.0s)]
*  by his supporters. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=274.0s)]
*  No one has been killed. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=275.0s)]
*  And thank goodness. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=277.0s)]
*  But elections workers and officials in Georgia and across the country are being terrorized and are leaving their jobs in droves. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=278.0s)]
*  . [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xXleLwKmM&t=304.0s)]
