# Sen. Warnock: We know who Trump is, but who are we?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY)
*  It's worth remembering that as this whole conspiracy to overturn the election results [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=0.0s)]
*  was unfolding in Georgia, there was also an absolutely critical US Senate race that was [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=5.84s)]
*  taking place, a runoff election that would decide which party controlled the US Senate in Washington. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  In the midst of all of this, on January 5th, 2021, the day before the attack on the Capitol, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=17.84s)]
*  Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, Democratic US Senator Raphael Warnock, was elected. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=21.76s)]
*  Joining us now is Senator Warnock. I should mention he is also the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=28.16s)]
*  in the city of Atlanta. Senator Warnock, there's so much going on tonight in your home state of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=33.92s)]
*  Georgia and in politics and all the drama around this. I really appreciate you taking the time to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=38.4s)]
*  talk with us about it. Thank you so much. Always great to be with you, Rachel. So what do you think [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=42.8s)]
*  people should understand around the country looking in on Georgia, living through everything [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=50.64s)]
*  that you've lived through, everything that you've seen up close that's happened, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=56.08s)]
*  knowing what you know about Fulton County and the criminal justice system and political pressures [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  in the state? What do you think people from outside Georgia should know about this pressure, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=64.32s)]
*  about this process as the pressure just gets unbelievably intense on what's happening in Fulton County? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=69.52s)]
*  Well, Rachel, this is playing out in Georgia, in Fulton County, but this is a moral moment [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=77.52s)]
*  for our nation. We know who Donald Trump is. The question right now is who are we? What kind of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=83.84s)]
*  country are we going to be going forward? And as we watch all of this play out, we're reminded that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=89.84s)]
*  democracy is not a noun. It's a verb. We are required to remain vigilant and active. It's a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=98.08s)]
*  lot like brushing and flossing. There's never a moment when you can stop. Otherwise, you have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=105.2s)]
*  decay. And so while Donald Trump and the other defendants may be at the center of this particular [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=111.92s)]
*  case, my eye is on the democracy itself because I believe in democracy. I believe that it is the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=118.88s)]
*  political enactment of a spiritual idea, this notion that each of us has within us a spark of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=126.48s)]
*  the divine, and therefore we ought to have a voice in the direction of the country and our [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=132.48s)]
*  destiny within it. And that's what's under assault. And all of us as Americans, as Americans, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=136.72s)]
*  have to stand up and fight for that, which is precious and rare in the history of humankind, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=143.36s)]
*  democracy. I was struck by reading today about an event that happened this weekend in Georgia. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=149.12s)]
*  A bunch of different groups, including the Georgia NAACP and Black Voters Matter, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=158.64s)]
*  met in Coffee County at the AME Church in Coffee County, which of course is one of the locations [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=162.56s)]
*  that has become famous because of the indictment of former President Trump and his co-defendants. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=169.68s)]
*  Coffee County is one of the places where people who were, who shouldn't have had access to voting [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=175.04s)]
*  machines and tabulating machines nevertheless were given access and all the sensitive data from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=180.24s)]
*  those machines was uploaded onto the internet and downloaded all over the world. People met in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Coffee County this weekend to talk about the damage done to their democracy in Coffee County [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  and to try to reckon with why it's taken this long to fix it, why the police weren't involved [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=196.8s)]
*  sooner, why there hasn't necessarily been any assurance to people in that county that the next [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=201.52s)]
*  effort to vote in that county will be safe. I wonder if your constituents in Georgia sort [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=207.28s)]
*  of feel this more personally, more directly, more acutely than all of us do looking at it nationally. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=214.24s)]
*  All my constituents who I'm so very proud to represent feel it. I have to tell you, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=220.4s)]
*  I feel it personally. My mother is from that part of the state. I know a lot about Coffee County, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=225.84s)]
*  and my mother was born and raised in Weir County, Waycross, Georgia nearby. And as you pointed out [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  in your opening discussion, the people of Georgia did an amazing thing on January 5th, 2021. They [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=238.8s)]
*  elected their first black United States senator. And my mom, who's from Weir County, that part of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=247.84s)]
*  the state, who grew up picking somebody else's tobacco and picking somebody else's cotton, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=255.76s)]
*  picked her youngest son to be a United States senator. That's what's at stake here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=260.96s)]
*  The ability of ordinary people to have a voice in their democracy, and that was assaulted by the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=265.36s)]
*  former president and those who are enabling him in so many ways. He deserves to have his day in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  court. He claims his innocence, and he's innocent until proven guilty. So that due process ought to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=282.64s)]
*  carry itself out. While at the same time, what we've got to do is focus on the ways in which the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=288.64s)]
*  actions of January 6th, this unprecedented attack on our Capitol, the most violent [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=295.28s)]
*  since the War of 1812, then metastasized into a cancer of voter suppression laws all across [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=302.08s)]
*  our country. Over 300 voter suppression laws were introduced in about 45 states just this year, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=308.8s)]
*  and about 13 of them have passed. And so it is the big lie that is driving this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=316.24s)]
*  So regardless of the outcome of the former president's case, we've got a problem, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=324.32s)]
*  and we've got to deal with it, which is why we need to pass the legislation that I and others [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=330.0s)]
*  have put forward on voting rights. We've got to preserve our democracy. We've got to uphold once [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=336.32s)]
*  again that great American covenant, one person, one vote. Nothing could be more important because [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=342.16s)]
*  the democracy is the whole game. It is the framework in which we get to fight for everything that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=348.4s)]
*  matters. And long after this case is over and the books have been closed here, we'll have to face [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=354.0s)]
*  one another. And our children are going to ask us, what did you do when the democracy itself was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=359.52s)]
*  imperiled? And I want to be able to look my kids in the eye and say that I stood up for the best in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=365.76s)]
*  the American ideal, that I stood up for the best in the covenant that we have with one another. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2SA0EDNeYY&t=371.35999999999996s)]
