Video Description: In the midst of the frenzy over the news of Donald Trump's indictment, one politician made especially dangerous remarks that would threaten the foundations of American justice, and it wasn't Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis, in a tweet, suggested that he would ignore the law and his duties as governor in order to help keep Trump from being accountable to the law, a proposition more dangerous than any indictment, Rachel Maddow explains.

# Maddow: Reckless DeSantis rhetoric would break U.S. legal system
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM)
*  There is word from one of Trump's lawyers that President Trump is expected to be arraigned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=0.0s)]
*  That means he's expected to be—that we expect him to turn himself in to be booked on these [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=5.54s)]
*  charges on Tuesday next week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=11.1s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=15.42s)]
*  Because that gets us to the one actually completely off-the-rails thing that has happened today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=17.18s)]
*  The one break-the-rules, break-the-system thing that has happened today since this indictment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=23.14s)]
*  was first reported by the New York Times. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=29.4s)]
*  And it relates to the fuzziness of that specific part of the plan, the way it logistically [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  works for a person to be indicted on felony charges, specifically the question of Trump [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=38.44s)]
*  turning himself in to face arraignment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=44.72s)]
*  There is one thing that has happened today, not the indictment itself. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=47.82s)]
*  The thing that has happened today that does potentially pose a threat to us as a country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=52.14s)]
*  is something that somebody completely outside this story, completely outside this criminal [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=57.92s)]
*  process, completely outside this news, decided to do in response to it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=63.18s)]
*  And that is something that happened within five minutes of Trump's lawyer first putting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=70.18s)]
*  out the first statement to reporters that Trump would turn himself in for arraignment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=75.9s)]
*  early next week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  We got one Trump lawyer telling reporters early next week Trump will turn himself in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=82.32s)]
*  Within five minutes of that first statement from Trump's lawyer, a Republican politician [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=88.08s)]
*  named Ron DeSantis, who is the governor of Florida, made this statement online saying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=98.46s)]
*  at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=104.24s)]
*  And that's some of the verbiage in this statement from Ron DeSantis that echoes word for word [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=108.88s)]
*  what Donald Trump said in response to his own indictment today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=114.28s)]
*  He's echoing Trump's language exactly, which is fine, criticizing the legal process, criticizing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=119.28s)]
*  the indictment, criticizing your perceived political enemies, calling for your supporters [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=124.46s)]
*  to blah, blah, blah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=128.04s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=129.04s)]
*  Saying that the legal process for extraditing somebody from one state to another is something [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=130.44s)]
*  that will not be followed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=137.4s)]
*  The Florida governor, Trump decides that he's not going to turn himself in, that he's going [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=139.96s)]
*  to stay in Florida and come and get me. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=142.96s)]
*  Florida's not going to allow that process to go forward because it's a former president, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=145.08s)]
*  because it's Donald Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, that could break us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, indicting a president, indicting a politician is a normal thing in this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  Trying to save a legal system no longer applies in this country if you try to apply it to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=163.08s)]
*  our political guy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  That is something that can break the rule of law in this country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=170.44s)]
*  That is something, I mean, if anything, is the first proverbial shot at Fort Sumter today. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  That shot was fired not by Donald Trump, but by Ron DeSantis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgQH6rpiqM&t=177.56s)]
