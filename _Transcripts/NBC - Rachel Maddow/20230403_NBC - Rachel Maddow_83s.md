# DeSantis signs bill allowing gun carrying without a permit; signing closed to public
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo)
*  Meanwhile today, the Republican governor of Florida made a sort of telling decision to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=0.0s)]
*  do this behind closed doors. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=6.4s)]
*  Today Ron DeSantis signed new legislation for Florida and he did it in this session that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=8.68s)]
*  was closed to the public. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=13.44s)]
*  Only the NRA was invited and other pro-gun lobbyists, nobody else knew about it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=16.44s)]
*  But the bill that he signed there with the NRA behind closed doors will now make it legal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=22.12s)]
*  in Florida for anybody to carry a concealed loaded weapon with no permit, no training, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=28.72s)]
*  no background check, no license. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=35.96s)]
*  So if you're in Florida and you're breathing, feel free to put a loaded gun in your pants [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=38.8s)]
*  and take it wherever you want. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=43.0s)]
*  New law signed into effect today by Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=45.12s)]
*  Interesting that Governor Ron DeSantis chose to do this signing without the public invited, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=50.04s)]
*  without anybody even notified in advance that he was doing it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=55.04s)]
*  It was just him and the gun lobbyists behind closed doors. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbt6t2_gzNo&t=58.16s)]
