# Foreign Policy Experts Advocate 'Limited No-Fly Zone' As Humanitarian Outcry Grows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA)
*  It was yesterday that Poland offered to send all of its MiG-29 jets, Russian-made jets, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=0.0s)]
*  to Ukraine via a U.S. air base in Germany. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=5.88s)]
*  One top U.S. official called the announcement a, quote, surprise move. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=9.24s)]
*  Well, today, the Pentagon spokesman made it clear the idea was a nonstarter. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=12.84s)]
*  Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland's willingness to continue to look for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=19.68s)]
*  ways to assist Ukraine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  But he stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=27.48s)]
*  the Ukrainian Air Force at this time and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=30.6s)]
*  either. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=36.44s)]
*  But at this time, we believe the provision of additional fighter aircraft provides little [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=37.44s)]
*  increased capabilities at high risk. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=42.44s)]
*  We also believe that there are alternative options that are much better suited to support [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=47.1s)]
*  the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=50.72s)]
*  And we will continue to pursue those options. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  So the U.S. says it won't give Ukraine the planes that they've urgently asked for and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=59.12s)]
*  that there are alternative options. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=65.36s)]
*  But the world is asking, what are those options? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=67.32s)]
*  Well, here's one that's being proposed in an open letter signed by 27 foreign policy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=69.88s)]
*  experts. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  Quote, we urge the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to impose a limited no-fly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  zone over Ukraine, starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=82.0s)]
*  upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=87.12s)]
*  What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  with Russia, but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive loss [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  of Ukrainian lives. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=104.12s)]
*  End quote. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=105.52s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the experts who signed that letter, John Herbst, former United States [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=106.52s)]
*  ambassador to Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=110.6s)]
*  He's currently director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=111.88s)]
*  Ambassador, good evening. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=115.28s)]
*  Thank you for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=119.44s)]
*  The world is looking at this, and they don't really understand a disagreement between America [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=120.44s)]
*  and Poland about these particular planes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=125.28s)]
*  They are watching a humanitarian disaster unfold, and they want to know what can actually [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  be done. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=133.24s)]
*  You and 26 others have proposed something very specific. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=134.24s)]
*  Please tell us about it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=137.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=139.12s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=140.72s)]
*  Moscow's two-week-old offensive against Ukraine has largely bogged down. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=142.72s)]
*  Putin is frustrated. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=149.0s)]
*  When his campaign in Syria, which he began in the fall of 2015, did not produce results, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=150.84s)]
*  after several months, he went to massive bombardment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=158.76s)]
*  There's a risk he'll do that now, and he's already bombarded residential areas in Kharkiv. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  If he does that, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=167.12s)]
*  will die. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  The idea that we're proposing is to establish not necessarily a no-fly zone, but an area [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=173.68s)]
*  where Russian planes will not be able to bomb civilians. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=178.84s)]
*  That's the basic idea. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=184.44s)]
*  When you said a limited or contained no-fly zone, what would that look like over the country? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=186.24s)]
*  Who determines to what it is limited? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=190.32s)]
*  Well, we would make it determinate. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  The US government and with our NATO allies would make a determination. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=195.12s)]
*  It would look at areas where civilians are trying to get out of war zones, where we know [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=198.56s)]
*  the Russians have blocked the establishment of real humanitarian corridors. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=202.68s)]
*  It would certainly operate in the West and around Kiev. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=206.36s)]
*  It might operate further East, where, again, civilians are subject to daily bombardment [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  and the Russians are not letting them leave. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=213.4s)]
*  We would not, unlike a regular fly zone, initiate any action against Russian or any other forces. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=215.8s)]
*  We would be there to make sure that action is not taken against innocent civilians. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=222.0s)]
*  This seems to have been rejected fairly quickly out of hand. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=227.16s)]
*  You regret that that's the case. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=230.08s)]
*  You think that there's more creative thinking to be had between the United States and NATO. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=231.32s)]
*  The rejection of this out of hand, just like the unfortunate decision by the Biden administration [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=236.4s)]
*  on the warplanes to Ukraine, suggests timidity, suggests the United States thinks that somehow [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=241.44s)]
*  we have to avoid provoking Putin. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=248.96s)]
*  Putin, who's just been escalating massively in Ukraine, for us to simply send those weapons [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=251.28s)]
*  to Ukraine so we can defend himself is the normal decision. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  To say we can't do it because it's escalatory suggests fear. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=259.36s)]
*  Putin has a fine nose for detecting fear, and that just emboldens him to be more aggressive. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=263.24s)]
*  We've seen a very sad week in American statesmanship regarding the rejection out of hand of this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  limited no-fly zone and the rejection of these warplanes to a country which is defending [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=275.36s)]
*  itself against a much stronger neighbor. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=279.6s)]
*  Ambassador, the things that are starting to look like war crimes, the potential deliberate [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  targeting of civilians, the attacks on hospitals, does that change the way the United States [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  and the world should be looking at this, that this is becoming a humanitarian catastrophe [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=294.72s)]
*  that we need to get involved in to solve and we need to maybe make the idea of getting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=298.72s)]
*  into a conflict with Russia of secondary importance? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=302.48s)]
*  Of course you're right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=306.8s)]
*  And that's what makes those decisions this week so short-sighted. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=308.8s)]
*  The American public overwhelmingly supports Ukraine facing this massive aggression from Moscow. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=313.68s)]
*  And if in fact Moscow moves to this massive bombardment, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=320.32s)]
*  the public's going to be calling for us to do more. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=323.92s)]
*  And we saw the president, President Biden, last week reject stopping oil purchases from Russia. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=326.32s)]
*  Then under congressional and public pressure, he changed his mind. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  And this may well happen again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=335.36s)]
*  Of once Moscow begins a campaign which murders tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  we may be forced to act precisely along the lines that my 26 colleagues suggested. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=344.24s)]
*  We should not be saying no to an object, to a proposal which would save those lives. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=350.4s)]
*  Again, what we've done by taking these two off the table, if only temporarily, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=357.28s)]
*  we're conveying to Moscow that we can be intimidated. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=361.2s)]
*  And that's a very dangerous thing with a man like Putin. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=364.24s)]
*  We are far more powerful than Russia. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=367.2s)]
*  We need to remember that we're a superpower. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=368.88s)]
*  And that Putin has to worry about us at least as much, if not more, than we have to worry about him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=371.04s)]
*  And that should undergird our diplomacy and our national security policy in this crisis. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=384.0s)]
*  Ambassador, we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RViGM3b9eIA&t=385.28000000000003s)]
