# Why The First NATO Summit Almost Didn't Happen
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0)
*  Now, the very first NATO summit was in 1957. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=0.0s)]
*  NATO had been formed eight years earlier, but there had never actually been a NATO summit, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=4.86s)]
*  a meeting of all the leaders of the NATO countries. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=9.22s)]
*  So that was going to be a major world event. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=12.06s)]
*  It was a dozen years after World War II, amid the increasing competition between the West [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=14.14s)]
*  and the Soviet Union, NATO countries would gather in Paris to reaffirm their unity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=19.66s)]
*  And the undisputed leader of the alliance was President Dwight Eisenhower. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=25.3s)]
*  Not only because he was the American president. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=29.86s)]
*  After being the commander of allied forces in Europe during World War II, but before [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=32.76s)]
*  he was elected president, Eisenhower became the first supreme allied commander of NATO. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=36.7s)]
*  But President Eisenhower almost didn't make it to that very first NATO summit, because [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  just a few weeks before the summit was due to start, this happened. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Illness stalks the chief executive as he stands bareheaded in the chill autumn air [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=54.36s)]
*  at Blair House. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=61.96s)]
*  Shortly after, a chill sends him to bed, forerunner of more serious news. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=63.4s)]
*  The following day, America hears the alarming tidings. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=68.52s)]
*  From White House physician Howard Snyder, the nation learns that the president has suffered [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=71.2s)]
*  a mild stroke, resulting in a speech impairment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=75.78s)]
*  Secretary Dulles and other government leaders, including Defense Secretary McElroy, converge [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=79.64s)]
*  on the White House, where acting press secretary Ann Wheaton issues bulletins. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=83.96s)]
*  Vice President Nixon sums up the situation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=88.92s)]
*  We expect that the president, after a period of recuperation, will be able to return to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  his desk in the White House. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  And that he will, as the doctors have indicated, fully recover. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=101.56s)]
*  President Eisenhower had already had a heart attack in office two years earlier. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=108.16s)]
*  Now this mini stroke. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=112.16s)]
*  There were concerns that he might not be up to the regular duties of office, let alone [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=114.56s)]
*  a grueling transatlantic trip to meet with 14 other world leaders. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  The New York Times published this cartoon depicting Eisenhower as Atlas, carrying both [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=123.92s)]
*  the problems of his office and questionable health on his back, while trudging up a hill [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=129.12s)]
*  marked course of world events. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=135.04s)]
*  The Times worried that going to the NATO summit would be, quote, a two-gallon gesture that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=139.0s)]
*  may bring on another siege of illness. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=144.36s)]
*  But I did go to Paris, arriving at the NATO summit all smiles, just three weeks after [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=147.6s)]
*  his health scare. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=153.08s)]
*  And the other NATO leaders were so demonstrably relieved that he made it that Eisenhower started [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=154.72s)]
*  his opening remarks at the summit thanking them all for their well wishes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=160.56s)]
*  Mr. President, my NATO friends, before I begin, I should like to express my appreciation of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=165.76s)]
*  the over-generous sentiments that have been expressed by President Besh and by the Prime [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  Minister of France, respecting myself. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=182.96s)]
*  And particularly, I appreciate your good wishes for my good health. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=186.68s)]
*  And so the very first NATO summit ever began, the first of nearly 30 NATO summits that have [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=194.44s)]
*  taken place in the decade since. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  And NATO's membership in that time has doubled. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=201.96s)]
*  In 1957, there were 15 NATO countries. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=205.84s)]
*  Now there are 30. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=209.4s)]
*  And so at today's NATO summit in Brussels, they needed a much bigger table for their [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=211.26s)]
*  meeting than they did in 1957. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNPoclOJsv0&t=215.28s)]
