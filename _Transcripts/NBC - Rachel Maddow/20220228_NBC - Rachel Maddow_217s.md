# Why Sanctions May Be The West's Most Powerful Weapon Against Putin And His Oligarchs
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk)
*  The distance between Putin and his people had a crowbar shoved into the scene today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=0.0s)]
*  When the financial sanctions against Russia got turned up to 11, Putin knew in advance [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  he was going to do this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=12.36s)]
*  He has been laying the groundwork for this for a long time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=13.52s)]
*  He knew there would be economic sanctions against him if he did something like this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=15.64s)]
*  One of the ways he tried to make Russia sanctions proof in advance of this invasion was by building [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  up a huge pile of foreign currency in the Russian central bank, basically as a rainy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=25.12s)]
*  day fund, something that the Russian government could live off for a long while until the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=29.4s)]
*  rest of the world calmed down and let them resume business as usual. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=33.48s)]
*  They built up a reserve currency fund of like between 600 and 700 billion dollars. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Well today, Russia lost access to its rainy day fund when new sanctions targeted not just [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=43.92s)]
*  more individual Russians, not just more individual Russian banks and institutions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=50.04s)]
*  Today, new sanctions hit the Russian central bank, which never happens. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=54.4s)]
*  Sanctions are never that steep, but that means in immediate order, Russia's got no access [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=59.6s)]
*  to its cash reserves. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=64.96s)]
*  And sure, they've still got rubles. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=67.84s)]
*  They still got their own currency. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=69.64s)]
*  But as of right now, a ruble is basically worthless. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  The ruble crashed today down nearly to zero. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=74.0s)]
*  A ruble right now is worth less than a penny. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=76.56s)]
*  Their national credit rating is downgraded officially to junk. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=79.56s)]
*  Russia has basically one industry, oil and gas, but their oil and gas technology is terrible [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=83.36s)]
*  in part because their companies are terribly run by Putin cronies who run them like organized [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=87.72s)]
*  crime families. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  They basically run them like gangsters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  Russia's oil and gas industry is the one industry they've got, but they need Western oil companies [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=96.36s)]
*  in order to competitively operate their one industry and in order for it to actually function [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=101.88s)]
*  in a modern sense. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=107.16s)]
*  Well, say goodbye to that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=108.16s)]
*  As of today, BP, the single largest foreign stakeholder in the Russian economy, pulled [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=109.8s)]
*  out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=114.96s)]
*  They pulled out of their giant, giant multibillion dollar stake in Rosneft. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=115.96s)]
*  In short order, Shell pulled out from their joint operations with Gazprom as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=120.44s)]
*  Exxon's apparently still there, though someone should perhaps check on that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=126.24s)]
*  Ask me again in the morning. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=129.92s)]
*  But BP and Shell pulling out of the Russian oil and gas industry? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=133.0s)]
*  Rather than see what was going to happen on the Russian markets today, Russia actually [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=139.6s)]
*  just closed them altogether. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=142.72s)]
*  Literally they didn't allow their stock market to open because they knew what it was going [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=144.64s)]
*  to look like. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=148.24s)]
*  And again, it's sort of good news, nightmare news, heartening news, worrying news. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=151.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=156.72s)]
*  It is heartening for Ukraine. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=157.72s)]
*  It must be to see the whole Western world act with alacrity, to act in a unified way, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=158.72s)]
*  to stomp on Russia economically so fast. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=163.6s)]
*  I mean, even Switzerland, famously neutral Switzerland, got in on the sanctions today. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=166.8s)]
*  They never do that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=171.08s)]
*  You can imagine all the Russian oligarchs and kleptocrats who might have been worried [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  about sanctions anywhere else in the world. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  They were surely comfortable in the knowledge that whatever else they had to get out of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=178.3s)]
*  elsewhere in the world, their Swiss bank accounts at least would be safe. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=181.56s)]
*  Sorry, their Swiss bank accounts as of today are frozen with no warning. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=184.8s)]
*  And again, Switzerland never does that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=189.96s)]
*  So it's not like they would have anticipated it was going to happen and move their stuff [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=192.36s)]
*  out before they could get hit. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHi2c4mFLvk&t=195.36s)]
