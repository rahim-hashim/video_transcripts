# Trump pick for FBI, Kash Patel, took $25k for role in Russia-linked anti-FBI film
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU)
*  Just after the election, three days after the election, a right-wing streaming network [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=0.0s)]
*  started airing a six-part Russian propaganda special attacking the FBI. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=9.38s)]
*  Now, I say it was a Russian propaganda special because, specifically, it was made by a producer [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=17.52s)]
*  who has made a living making propaganda for the Kremlin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=24.7s)]
*  One of the producers, the guy who financed and produced this film, this Ducky series, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=29.82s)]
*  this attack on the FBI, he has been paid by the Kremlin to produce videos that are designed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=34.64s)]
*  to lure Westerners, including Americans, to leave the West and move to Mother Russia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=41.16s)]
*  That project was funded by the Presidential Foundation for Cultural Initiatives, which [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=48.58s)]
*  is a state entity created in the Kremlin by Vladimir Putin in 2021. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  This guy served on the board of a Russian propaganda outlet that was designed to look [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=59.54s)]
*  like an American news site. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=63.7s)]
*  It was launched in the months leading up to our 2024 election. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=65.62s)]
*  It was full of pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine content. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=69.58s)]
*  This guy has produced hagiographic biographies of pro-Kremlin dictators, including, I kid [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=73.62s)]
*  you not, an eight-part series singing the praises of the dictator of Kazakhstan. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=80.6s)]
*  And that was paid for by a charity controlled by the dictator of Kazakhstan. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=90.74s)]
*  He also created a pro-Kremlin anti-Ukraine film that was paid for by a pro-Kremlin anti-Ukraine [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  oligarch who has been under U.S. sanctions for more than a decade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  He and his company produced another anti-Ukraine film last year that featured claims smearing [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=107.42s)]
*  President Biden that were delivered by a guy who is under indictment in this country and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=112.94s)]
*  sanctioned by the U.S. government as a Russian agent. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=120.62s)]
*  So this is kind of their oeuvre. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=123.42s)]
*  This is what these folks do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  But their newest, this multi-part anti-FBI documentary that came out three days after [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=129.44s)]
*  our election in November. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=136.66s)]
*  It was directed by a former host from Russian state TV, which is sanctioned in this country [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=139.62s)]
*  as a vehicle for Kremlin-sponsored disinformation and disruption efforts targeting the American [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=145.94s)]
*  people in our elections. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, at this point, you're thinking, okay, dog bites man, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  Some streaming outlet is running a pro-Russia, anti-U.S. government thing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=158.76s)]
*  Okay, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=164.1s)]
*  You know you're thinking, this sounds very familiar. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=165.54s)]
*  There's a lot of things like this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=166.54s)]
*  We know Russia runs all sorts of psychological and disinformation campaigns against us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=167.82s)]
*  A big, slick, Kremlin-affiliated propaganda operation against the FBI, something designed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=176.14s)]
*  to smear the FBI. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=183.1s)]
*  Yeah, that tracks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=184.5s)]
*  We know the kind of stuff that they do to try to mess with us as a country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=186.22s)]
*  The FBI probably knows to expect it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=189.78s)]
*  They probably know how to handle these kinds of operations and threats from Russia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=191.7s)]
*  As long as they're from Russia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=198.61999999999998s)]
*  Senate financial disclosure forms show that President Donald Trump's nominee to lead [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=204.26s)]
*  the FBI was paid $25,000 by the company with the producer who has made the Russian propaganda [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=208.22s)]
*  for the Kremlin, who made this new film, Attacking the FBI. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=216.34s)]
*  Cash Patel was paid $25,000 by that production company, apparently for his participation [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=221.98s)]
*  in the anti-FBI film. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=229.46s)]
*  Mr. Patel appears in the film. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  He's in episode four. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=234.02s)]
*  He also got an executive producer credit on the film as well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=235.5s)]
*  This was first reported today by the excellent investigative reporter David Korn at Mother [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  Jones. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=245.02s)]
*  But we can show you this is from Cash Patel's required financial disclosure form to the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=247.3s)]
*  Office of Government Ethics as part of his nomination to be the director of the FBI. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=251.74s)]
*  Global Tree Productions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  That's this production company run by this Russian-American propagandist who was part [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=259.98s)]
*  of the Kremlin-funded influence campaign to get Westerners to move to Russia, who sat [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=265.22s)]
*  on the board of the Russian propaganda site, apparently designed to sway our election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=270.2s)]
*  Here's the record of their $25,000 payment to the man Donald Trump wants to put in charge [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=274.22s)]
*  of the FBI. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=280.82000000000005s)]
*  That payment apparently pursuant to his participation in their anti-FBI documentary. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=282.74s)]
*  We have reached out to Mr. Patel and to the White House and to the film producer for comment [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=292.86s)]
*  tonight we have not heard back. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  I should tell you the Washington Post has also picked up this story tonight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=298.22s)]
*  A spokesperson for Mr. Patel did tell the Post tonight, quote, the Senate has evaluated [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=301.7s)]
*  all potential conflicts and concerns. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=306.44s)]
*  Have they though? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=308.9s)]
*  Have they? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=310.97999999999996s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  Was everybody totally aware of this one? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=314.14s)]
*  Democrats on the Judiciary Committee did manage to push back Cash Patel's confirmation vote [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=320.74s)]
*  in that committee by a week. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=326.74s)]
*  That was before this new reporting came out. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  As of now, the vote on his nomination is scheduled for next Thursday. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=331.58s)]
*  I think we can expect all Democrats to pretty easily vote against Cash Patel for FBI director, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=335.26s)]
*  but until next Thursday, that's how long Republicans on that committee have to decide whether they're [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=341.22s)]
*  okay with this too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMttgznpeU&t=348.5s)]
