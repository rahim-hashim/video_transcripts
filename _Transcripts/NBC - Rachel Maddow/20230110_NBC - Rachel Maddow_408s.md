# Brazil sends crucial message with quick arrest of rioters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU)
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=0.0s)]
*  Professor of History at Yale University. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=2.6s)]
*  He's the author of among many books, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  the bestseller On Tyranny, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  20 Lessons from the 20th Century. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=9.18s)]
*  Professor Snyder, it's a real pleasure to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  It's been too long. Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Very glad to be with you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=15.32s)]
*  In terms of how tyranny works and how authoritarianism works, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=19.76s)]
*  I'm a little bit worried that I'm seeing this through [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=25.76s)]
*  to American lens and I'm seeing all of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=28.06s)]
*  this recent American precedent [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=30.9s)]
*  for the thing that we saw in Brazil this weekend. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=33.46s)]
*  Should I be looking at this with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=36.32s)]
*  a wider and more international lens? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  That this is the thing that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  authoritarian movements and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=40.94s)]
*  far-right movements do all the time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=42.66s)]
*  This shouldn't echo January 6th so much as we should see it as [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  a typical right-wing fascist pro-authoritarian tactic [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=49.0s)]
*  that people use all over the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=52.9s)]
*  Well, I think you're right to point to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=55.42s)]
*  the evident similarities between [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=58.06s)]
*  January 6th and January 8th. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  But I think both January 6th and January 8th, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=62.02s)]
*  as you suggest, are about larger trends too. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=64.62s)]
*  One of them is to discredit institutions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=68.62s)]
*  When you storm institutions, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=72.14s)]
*  when you show you can make yourself [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=73.66s)]
*  physically present in institutions, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=74.9s)]
*  when you break windows, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=76.44s)]
*  when you trash the place, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=77.5s)]
*  what you're showing is symbolically, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=79.5s)]
*  physically, that institutions don't matter. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=81.3s)]
*  What matters is force. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=83.82s)]
*  What matters is will. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=85.61999999999999s)]
*  That, of course, is one of the oldest, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=87.5s)]
*  one of the classic anti-democratic [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  or anti-rule of law moves. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=91.77999999999999s)]
*  You show disrespect for the institutions physically, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=93.36s)]
*  and then all that seems to be left is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=96.96s)]
*  the possibility that a person, a strong man, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  something besides these institutions, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=101.85999999999999s)]
*  should be running the country. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=103.85999999999999s)]
*  If we can humiliate the institutions, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=105.1s)]
*  then we get the strong man. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  That's a logic which is on display here in Brazil and in the US, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=108.46s)]
*  but it's also a classic logic. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=111.61999999999999s)]
*  Then likewise, a lie, an alternative reality, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=113.22s)]
*  a strong belief among lots of people that what happened is not what happened, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=117.5s)]
*  that we didn't really lose the vote, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=122.06s)]
*  we really won the vote. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=124.14s)]
*  That's common between January 6th and January 8th, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=125.46s)]
*  but it's also a big 20th century, 21st century phenomenon, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=127.92s)]
*  big lies which capture lots of people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  But with the recent twist, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=135.94s)]
*  I think this is true about Brazil and the US, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=137.42s)]
*  that it's social media bubbles which allow this to happen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=139.34s)]
*  I think there's an odd way in which the people who are storming these buildings [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=142.1s)]
*  are emerging from alternative reality into real reality as they do it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=145.34s)]
*  They're sure they're right because they're not hearing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=150.06s)]
*  any other voices in the social media reality where they live. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=152.62s)]
*  In terms of contending with the tactical power of those things that you're describing, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=156.02s)]
*  and in terms of standing up for democracy, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=162.34s)]
*  trying to protect democracy against these forces and attacks, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=164.62s)]
*  how much does it matter that there is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=169.34s)]
*  swift accountability for the people who participate in it and the people who organize it? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=173.1s)]
*  One of the differences between January 8th in Brazil, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=177.5s)]
*  January 6th in the United States is that we saw a lot of arrests in Brazil, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=179.98s)]
*  and that we've got a sitting president who is the successor to Bolsonaro, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=184.62s)]
*  saying that those who participated in this and those who organized it, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  will be held accountable swiftly and surely. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=191.9s)]
*  What role does accountability in the legal system, the criminal justice system, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  play in fending this off as a tactic against democracy? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=200.7s)]
*  Yeah, the comparison is absolutely right, and I'm very pleased for the Brazilian government [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=205.66s)]
*  that they were able to react so quickly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=211.1s)]
*  It's very important that people who try to carry out this kind of fascist move [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=214.06s)]
*  are aware that the law also has force beside it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  One of the things they're trying to do is monopolize force themselves. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=223.9s)]
*  They're trying to say, we are the ones who control violence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=227.34s)]
*  We intimidate you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=229.82s)]
*  We intimidate the law. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  We're going to do something which is so strange and confusing and violent [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=232.62s)]
*  that you won't know how to react to it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  And there was a bit of that in the US on January 6th. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=237.18s)]
*  It was so strange and unexpected and violent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  that the criminals just walked away from the crime scene. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  That's odd. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=246.3s)]
*  We didn't see that in Brazil today, and it's really important. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=247.18s)]
*  It's really important because things like this, they're kind of a test of force. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=250.54s)]
*  The people who are on the far right, that's what they believe in. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=255.26s)]
*  They believe in force. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  And if they don't meet any force on the other end, then they're going to continue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the people who are defending law should be unpredictable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=263.26s)]
*  It means that they should be predictable. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  It means that they should be confident that something like this is a crime [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  and that the pictures like the ones we're seeing, where if you commit a crime, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  you go and destroy property, you commit all kinds of crimes, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=274.38s)]
*  that you might just end up on a bus handcuffed, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=276.94s)]
*  that that's normal, that democracies, because the story that fascists always tell is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=279.66s)]
*  democracies are weak. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=283.42s)]
*  They won't fight back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  They're flabby. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=285.98s)]
*  They're decadent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's pretty important for democracies to be able to say, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=287.5s)]
*  no, actually, we stand for something, and that something we stand for is law. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  I think that that point that you just made, too, is very important about how [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=294.3s)]
*  there is a tactical impact to seeming unpredictable, chaotic, weird, strange, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=299.66s)]
*  and that treating these things as crimes, among other things, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=306.06s)]
*  and accountability is an important concept. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=309.42s)]
*  But among other things, using the criminal law to respond to things like this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=313.66s)]
*  has an effect of rationalizing the experience of what the country has just been through, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  of imposing not only order in terms of people being held accountable, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=322.54s)]
*  but also a framework of understanding that this is a crime. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=327.82s)]
*  This is something that exists within our system. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=330.94s)]
*  It does not destroy our system. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=333.66s)]
*  Our system itself can handle things like this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=335.26s)]
*  I think that's that rationalizing force is an important insight. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=337.82s)]
*  Yeah, and that we're all equal before the law. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  That any of us does something like this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=347.9s)]
*  You were asking directly about Trump. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=350.7s)]
*  It's very important for a democracy not to have these superheroes or supervillains [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=352.38s)]
*  who are judged by different standards. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=356.7s)]
*  It's very important that executives and former executives be subject to the rule of law, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=358.78s)]
*  because once you start developing a legal theory according to which they're exceptional people, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=362.94s)]
*  that little loophole will just grow bigger and bigger all the time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=367.26s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University, the author of, among many other books, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnklqYx20yU&t=371.5s)]
