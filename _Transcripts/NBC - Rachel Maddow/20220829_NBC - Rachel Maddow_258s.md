# Why People Are Advised To Take Iodine Tablets In The Event Of A Nuclear Disaster
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4)
*  In the event of a nuclear disaster, a nuclear blast, a dirty bomb, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=0.0s)]
*  or a conventional bomb is laced with radioactive material, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=3.44s)]
*  or particularly if there is a leak or an explosion at a nuclear power plant, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=6.24s)]
*  there's a few different kinds of radioactive particles that are likely to be released. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=11.28s)]
*  Cesium and strontium are two that you might hear about in the context of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=16.96s)]
*  radioactive fallout. They're two of the really bad ones. If you're exposed to radioactive strontium, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=21.92s)]
*  for example, your body essentially takes it in and treats it like it's calcium, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=25.92s)]
*  which means terrible things for your bones and your bone marrow and your blood and ultimately [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  your risk of all kinds of cancer. Strontium and other highly radioactive isotopes like cesium are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=35.6s)]
*  just terrible. But the most common isotopes associated with the nuclear power plant catastrophe [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=40.72s)]
*  are actually two different kinds of radioactive iodine. And we know from our elementary school [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  table salt understanding of basic biology that it's the thyroid that takes up iodine in the body. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  And that's where this matters. In the event of a radiation disaster where people are going to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  be exposed to radioactive fallout, one of the immediate and most common risks is that lots of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=67.92s)]
*  people are going to get thyroid cancer because, again, one of the most common things released in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=72.64s)]
*  radioactive fallout are a couple different kinds of radioactive iodine. We breathe that in. We [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  otherwise absorb it. We take it into our thyroid. And if it is radioactive iodine, we're going to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=82.8s)]
*  get thyroid cancer because of it. It's a scary concept. I know everything having to do with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=89.2s)]
*  radiation and radiation poisoning and nuclear accidents is absolutely terrifying. But even so, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=94.16s)]
*  just a little bit of understanding is helpful because just like with table salt, just a little [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=99.6s)]
*  bit of understanding is enough to get you to an understanding of this one very practical consequence. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=104.0s)]
*  Again, we need iodine in our bodies. We absorb iodine in our thyroid gland. But we don't do so [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=109.68s)]
*  infinitely. The thyroid takes in iodine, but the thyroid can only take in so much. It can become [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=116.64s)]
*  saturated with iodine. And once it's saturated with iodine, it won't take in anymore. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=122.56s)]
*  So you see where this is going, right? In the event of a radiation disaster where lots of people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  are going to be exposed to radioactive fallout, one of the things that you do in that circumstance [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  is you make sure that people have iodine tablets that they can take right away before they're [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  exposed to any fallout. If you take an iodine tablet, that will mean that your thyroid is [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=145.92s)]
*  saturated with healthy non-radioactive iodine. That means when the radioactive iodine comes your [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=150.48s)]
*  way, your thyroid will not absorb it. Your thyroid is already full. You will avoid getting thyroid [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=156.32s)]
*  cancer. The CDC explains it this way, quote, think of filling a jar with blue marbles. If you then [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=161.2s)]
*  pour green marbles over the jar, there won't be any room for them inside the jar. They will just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  spill out. Nobody should proactively dose themselves with iodine like this as a matter, of course. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  This is a circumstance where there is a nuclear disaster on your doorstep. But if there is a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  nuclear disaster on your doorstep, it is a good form of protection to have on hand. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=186.24s)]
*  As of this past Friday, iodine pills are now being distributed in Ukraine, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  in the area surrounding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It's Europe's largest nuclear power [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=201.2s)]
*  plant. Officials are now officially giving out those iodine pills to anybody who lives within [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=207.28s)]
*  a 30-mile radius of that nuclear power plant. That means tens of thousands of people. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=212.56s)]
*  People there, men, women, and children, are being told, do not take the iodine pills preemptively. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=217.28s)]
*  But in case of an accident or a disaster, in case of radiation exposure, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=222.32s)]
*  you're going to need to take these to protect yourself. Unfortunately, that is a very practical [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=226.48s)]
*  concern right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=232.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2q6m-1EEd4&t=242.56s)]
