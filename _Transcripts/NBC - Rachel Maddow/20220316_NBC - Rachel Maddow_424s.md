# Doctors Describe 'Hell On Earth' In Wake Of Russian Bombing Of Mariupol
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94)
*  For almost two weeks now, the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders has been sounding the alarm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=0.0s)]
*  that the port city of Mariupol in the southeastern corner of Ukraine is in particularly dire straits. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  They warned then that many were lacking basic needs like running water. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=11.6s)]
*  And since then, things have only gotten worse. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=15.6s)]
*  This is a phone call between Doctors Without Borders and one of their staff members in Mariupol from this past Saturday, March 12th. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=18.32s)]
*  People lost connection with their relatives. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=25.6s)]
*  They don't know what is happening with their relatives in other districts of Mariupol. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=29.6s)]
*  And it's already lasting for more than one week and people are really very worried about their relatives. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  They don't know if they're alive or they're already maybe not alive. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  We saw people who died because of lack of medication. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=47.2s)]
*  And there are a lot of such people inside Mariupol and many people who were killed and injured. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=54.0s)]
*  And they're just lying on the ground and neighbors just digging the hole in the ground and their bodies inside. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=60.8s)]
*  That was Saturday. Today, that already terrible situation escalated dramatically. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=73.6s)]
*  Mariupol City Council said today that a powerful Russian bomb hit this building, a theater where City Council believes hundreds of civilians were sheltering. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=79.2s)]
*  Now, city officials could not immediately assess how many people have been killed or injured because the entrance to the bomb shelter has been blocked by rubble. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  So what does this mean for the already precarious medical situation on the ground in Mariupol? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=94.9s)]
*  And what does medical care look like in all of Ukraine right now? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=99.8s)]
*  Joining us now is Alex Wade. He's an emergency coordinator with Doctors Without Borders. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=106.2s)]
*  He spent the last few weeks traveling all over Ukraine from Lviv in the West to the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=111.2s)]
*  And that's where he joins us from tonight. Alex, thanks very much for joining us this evening. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=117.4s)]
*  I know you and the world are particularly concerned right now about the city of Mariupol. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=122.2s)]
*  Prior to today's news about the bombing at a theater there that was being used as a shelter. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=126.7s)]
*  What made Mariupol situation worse than other cities? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=131.7s)]
*  For us, one of the most concerning things is that we've been completely cut off from being able to access Mariupol. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=136.89999999999998s)]
*  So we also lost communications with the hospitals there we had been in contact with, who we had been donating supplies to. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=143.2s)]
*  The last communication we had was that they were receiving an increased amount of wounded and they were worried about running out of supplies [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=150.5s)]
*  because the supply, the medical supply chain in the entire country has been disrupted due to this war. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=158.8s)]
*  And so we were worried about the situation in the hospitals. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  But for us also, we have we have staff colleagues of ours who work for MSF who are there in Mariupol who've been reporting to us the conditions. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  And they are truly horrific. They're saying it's a living nightmare. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=175.10000000000002s)]
*  They're saying it's hell on earth. They've reported to us the lack of water and food in the city. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=180.3s)]
*  They've reported to us the dead bodies littering the streets and stories of neighbors having to bury the dead bodies of their own neighbors [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=186.5s)]
*  that people have started dying due to lack of access to medical care. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  People with chronic conditions who need access to insulin, hemodialysis, pregnant women who need access to safe birthing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=198.8s)]
*  And then also the many, many people who have died from the violence and from the shelling inside the city. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=207.5s)]
*  Alex, Doctors Without Borders or MSF as you call it, Medecins Sans Frontières, has had a lot of experience with taking doctors into some of the worst places in the world in terms of atrocities and dangers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=216.3s)]
*  You are facing a situation where not only is your medical supply chain imperiled, but there have been hospitals and medical facilities that have been hit. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=230.3s)]
*  How does this affect the delivery of your services? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=239.8s)]
*  I mean, it affects it enormously because indeed we do work all over the world in conflict zones, but we do it with our principles of neutrality and impartiality, negotiating with all partners. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=242.7s)]
*  And under the rules of international humanitarian law, we try to work in a protected environment such as hospitals, negotiating with all parties that it is in everyone's interest for civilian non-combatants to have access to medical care, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=255.7s)]
*  as is their right due to international humanitarian law and what we also call the rules of war. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=271.4s)]
*  And until present, we can see that the rules of war have not always been respected so far. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=275.4s)]
*  There's been shelling in residential areas. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=280.4s)]
*  There have been civilian casualties, innocent people who should be safe to stay in their homes or should be safe to choose to leave and seek shelter elsewhere. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=283.4s)]
*  And we haven't been seeing that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=292.4s)]
*  We've seen hospitals being hit and there has been bombings in numerous residential areas. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=295.09999999999997s)]
*  So it makes us our ability to work incredibly complicated. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  We don't have the guarantees we usually try to obtain in conflict zones to have all parties respecting humanitarian access for the population. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  We haven't been able to have those sort of assurances and guarantees until now. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  We haven't been able to access Marypole in the way we would like to bring in supplies, to bring in personnel and to support the health system. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=318.8s)]
*  What does that actually mean, Alex, for the volunteers on which your organization exists? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=327.8s)]
*  Obviously, you get donations, but you have doctors, nurses, health care professionals and other volunteers who go into these places. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=333.8s)]
*  They are going into a place where they do not have the normal guarantees that they're used to. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=342.5s)]
*  There are never any guarantees with anything Doctors Without Borders does. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=348.5s)]
*  But how does that affect the flow of people? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=351.5s)]
*  I mean, you know, it affects our ability to send people to the places where they're most needed. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=355.5s)]
*  So we have many, many staff in Ukraine who are operating in different parts of the country. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=361.5s)]
*  But the staff we have currently in Marypole are actually there because there was an ongoing project before the war started. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=370.2s)]
*  It's a project that opened in 2015 when the conflict in the East began. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=377.2s)]
*  And so it's staff who are already there with other ongoing activities who then got there once the war started. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=381.2s)]
*  We'd like to send emergency teams. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=389.2s)]
*  We have teams ready to go. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=392.2s)]
*  We have supply ready to go. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=393.2s)]
*  If such a passage opens up, but until now it hasn't. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=395.9s)]
*  And so we are unable to access the places like Marypole, which have the highest needs right now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdYs_w18o94&t=399.9s)]
