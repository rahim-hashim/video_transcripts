# Congressional Black Caucus Chair Offers Political Warning To Voting Rights Opponents
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g)
*  What do you say to your constituents and voting rights advocates who are growing concerned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=0.0s)]
*  if either bill isn't passed as we approach the 2022 midterm elections? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=4.84s)]
*  I feel sorry for those on the other side who didn't support this. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=11.64s)]
*  You know, we're very clear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=18.6s)]
*  Our constituents understand where we are. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=20.28s)]
*  Our constituents understand at all levels. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=24.78s)]
*  They understand victory. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=28.62s)]
*  I saw a black president elected because they voted and they stood in line for five to seven [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=29.8s)]
*  hours to vote. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=36.96s)]
*  You have heard the president himself say, thank you, Majority Whip Clyburn. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=39.36s)]
*  Thank you, South Carolina. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=45.72s)]
*  Thank you, black people, for voting overwhelmingly to elect him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=47.84s)]
*  That then got us our first female black Asian American vice president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Our people know that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=59.4s)]
*  Our people understand that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=61.24s)]
*  Who should be afraid are those who won't stand up for voting rights. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=63.44s)]
*  So we're sending a clarion call and you can print this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=68.0s)]
*  Shame on you for not doing it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=71.32s)]
*  Black folks will vote no matter what. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=73.68s)]
*  So it's not what's going to happen to us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=77.16s)]
*  It's what's going to happen to them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=79.36s)]
*  It's not what's going to happen to us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=83.4s)]
*  It is what's going to happen to them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=84.84s)]
*  You can print that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=86.6s)]
*  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty is chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=89.4s)]
*  That was her speaking last week about the fight to pass voting rights in Congress and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=92.16s)]
*  those who are on the wrong side of that vote, the wrong side of that history in her estimation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=96.4s)]
*  And she joins us live now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=102.48s)]
*  Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=103.48s)]
*  Madam Chair, it's a real pleasure to have you here tonight of all nights. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for making time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=110.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for asking me to be on your show. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=111.8s)]
*  Today is a special day with the nation watching. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=115.88s)]
*  The nation is watching and a lot of the nation, I think, is holding their breath about what's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=120.56s)]
*  going to happen tomorrow. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=124.8s)]
*  We played some words from Martin Luther King III from the March Today held under that banner, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  deliver for voting rights, deliver being the operative phrase there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=134.8s)]
*  Do you think that the United States will deliver? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=138.24s)]
*  Are you optimistic about what's going to happen tomorrow? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=140.96s)]
*  I don't know exactly what will happen tomorrow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=144.48s)]
*  I know the nation is pained and frustrated because of what we've been going through. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=147.16s)]
*  You know, we're looking at individuals who are not supporting reauthorizing the Voting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=153.68s)]
*  Rights Act and four Republican presidents in a bipartisan fashion reauthorized it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=159.16s)]
*  Five presidents in our time have reauthorized it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=166.96s)]
*  So tomorrow it will be on the United States Senate to do their job. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=170.68s)]
*  The House, we voted on voting rights more than three times. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=175.52s)]
*  This is not new for us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=180.8s)]
*  But tomorrow you will see us standing and watching as history will be made. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=182.2s)]
*  And let me just say this, for all those who don't support the Freedom to Vote John R. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=188.68s)]
*  Lewis Act, they're obstructionists. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=194.88s)]
*  And it will be on their hands because our communities and all of those who know what [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=198.56s)]
*  we have to lose, especially black and brown people have so much to lose that they will [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=205.12s)]
*  react. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=211.8s)]
*  But you won't keep us from voting. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=213.04s)]
*  And the senators should be scared about that because we know we don't cheat when it comes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=216.2s)]
*  to elections. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=222.08s)]
*  We get out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=223.38s)]
*  We stand in line. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=224.38s)]
*  And no matter how they try to suppress the vote, Democrats and black and brown Americans [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  will vote. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=232.56s)]
*  You've talked about the Congressional Black Caucus as being the conscience of the Congress [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=235.56s)]
*  on issues like this and so many others. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=240.28s)]
*  I wonder if you can give us a little window into the strategic thinking right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=242.28s)]
*  I mean, the way that you have turned that question on its head, the way you just did [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=247.16000000000003s)]
*  right now and the way we played that sound from you earlier speaking last week, talking [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  about how people who are opposing this are on the wrong side and they are the ones who [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=253.84s)]
*  need to worry about their futures in terms of how the politics of this will play out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=257.48s)]
*  I know that you are thinking about this in terms of three steps down the road, five steps [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=261.88s)]
*  down the road, ten steps down the road. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=265.48s)]
*  If things do fail tomorrow in the Senate, if Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema decide [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  that they want to be they want they want to go down in history this way for this reason, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=272.64s)]
*  is there a way under over or around that wall? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=279.2s)]
*  Is there another way to approach it? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=283.4s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=286.4s)]
*  We have been strategizing and certainly, as you said, the Congressional Black Caucus has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=287.6s)]
*  been a leader in this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=292.08s)]
*  Six months ago, I got arrested. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=293.96s)]
*  Other members have been out there marching, protesting, writing legislation, trying to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=296.4s)]
*  work with those on the other side of the aisle and our two senators over there who are having [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=302.56s)]
*  some initial problems that they are having, therefore the voting rights. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=309.08s)]
*  It is the big elephant in the room, the filibuster. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=315.2s)]
*  But it reminds me of when Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=318.92s)]
*  and Fannie Lou Hamer and so many others were going across that Edmund Pettus Bridge. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=322.12s)]
*  You know, they didn't cross it the first or the second time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=327.88s)]
*  They turned around and came back and strategized. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=331.56s)]
*  But then there was Bloody Sunday and they got it done. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=334.64s)]
*  I am saying to you, we won't give up. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  We will go back and we will go back and we will get it right because the Voting Rights [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  Act must be reauthorized. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=346.72s)]
*  So we'll go back and we'll recraft and we'll re-strategize. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=349.36s)]
*  But we won't stop talking about it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  We won't stop fighting for it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=355.72s)]
*  We won't give up. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=357.72s)]
*  And so I am hopeful that we will get there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  I am hopeful that we will have enough of the senators to do what's right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=362.92s)]
*  You know, someone said today if we had state rights in Washington, D.C., [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=368.28000000000003s)]
*  we wouldn't have this problem because we would have two senators who would be voting with us. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, we don't have that, but we will see what happens tomorrow. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=377.92s)]
*  But there will be another tomorrow and another tomorrow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMrlq5076g&t=381.92s)]
