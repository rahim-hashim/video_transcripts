Video Description: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer dismisses Mitch McConnell's suggestion of reforming the Electoral Count Act instead of passing voting rights legislation, and explains finite amount of time Democrats have to act on voting rights legislation and his hope that the "spotlight of history" will compel all of his Democratic colleagues to do the right thing.

# Fate Of Voting Rights Legislation Rests On Pressure From 'Spotlight Of History'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI)
*  One of the things that has emerged in the last few days is that the Republican leader, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. McConnell, has reportedly suggested that he is open to one small piece of the package [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  of reforms and the package of protections that you and your colleagues in the Biden [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=16.72s)]
*  administration support in terms of protecting voting rights, that he is potentially open [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=20.44s)]
*  to supporting reforms to the Electoral Count Act to try to prevent the limited procedural [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=25.64s)]
*  shenanigans that gave them their theory of the case in terms of why the Capitol attack [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=31.96s)]
*  happened on January 6th. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=38.8s)]
*  I just wanted to get your reaction to that apparent movement from Senator McConnell just [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=40.36s)]
*  on that one piece of those reforms and protections that you've been pushing for. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=45.44s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=51.0s)]
*  I think that what they're trying to do is try to substitute that for the very needed [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=52.0s)]
*  reforms that we have urged undoing what the state legislatures are doing throughout the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=57.44s)]
*  country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  And so it's sort of like saying, well, I'm going to rig the game, but then I'll make [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=64.56s)]
*  sure you count the score accurately. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=68.64s)]
*  What the hell is the point if you rig the game to count the score accurately? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  So that's point number one. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=74.34s)]
*  Point number two, it doesn't deal with the House or Senate. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=76.12s)]
*  The Electoral College only elects the president. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=78.48s)]
*  So it has nothing to do with any elections in the House and Senate which are trying, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=81.08000000000001s)]
*  which they're trying to rig into jaundice. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  And third, what they're trying to do is accomplish things in a different way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=88.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted Pence to rig the election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=92.04s)]
*  This law might say, well, let's let the state legislatures rig the election. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=96.56s)]
*  Neither is good. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=101.28s)]
*  So I think this is a fake. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=102.4s)]
*  I think it's a way to try and get the two senators that we have who are not on board [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=104.72000000000001s)]
*  to go for something that won't change the horrible, voracious change in the balance [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=110.68s)]
*  of power that will allow elections to slam things in the directions of Republicans in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  a dramatic way, in an unfair way, in an un-small-D democratic way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=122.4s)]
*  And I'm opposed to it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm opposed to allowing it to be the subject of this conversation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=128.88s)]
*  I want to talk about that later and reform the Electoral College fine, but it's no substitute [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=132.64s)]
*  for what we have to do. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=137.04s)]
*  And in terms of what you have to do, you've put a specific timeline on this now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=139.32s)]
*  You've said that by the Martin Luther King holiday, by a week from Monday, you want to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  vote on potentially changing the Senate rules or carving out some sort of exception from [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  the way the Senate rules are right now in order to be able to pass the voting rights [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=154.44s)]
*  protections that you support. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=158.0s)]
*  Tell me about the decision to put that specific timeline out there to create that expectation [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=159.8s)]
*  about when this is going to happen. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=164.56s)]
*  Tell me about your confidence that you're going to be able to get the vote that you want. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=166.24s)]
*  Well, first, we're running out of time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=170.52s)]
*  What these legislatures have done in 2021 and are now beginning to do in 2022, if you wait [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=173.84s)]
*  much longer, you won't be able to undo them in time for the 2022 elections. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  Even if the legislation says what they did is wrong, the courts may say it's too close [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  to the primary season. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  We can't change it. So we have to move quickly. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=190.62s)]
*  But second, requiring a vote on both the rules changes and on the actual legislation, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=193.5s)]
*  the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act says to each of my 50 senators. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=201.34s)]
*  You are going to have to make a decision. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  The spotlight of history is on you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=210.86s)]
*  Are you going to side with the forces that are dramatically undoing our elections, preventing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=213.62s)]
*  the right to vote a giant step backwards, certainly in the last 50 years, maybe even [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=219.1s)]
*  longer in terms of our democracy? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=224.14s)]
*  Or are you going to do the right thing? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=226.78s)]
*  And I think when the spotlight of history and the weight of history is on the shoulders [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=230.82s)]
*  of all 50 members, the hope is that they do the right thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=235.74s)]
*  Is there a guarantee? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=240.1s)]
*  No, but we were going to have to have a vote. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  Have to and we will. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonyqB4KwdI&t=243.94s)]
