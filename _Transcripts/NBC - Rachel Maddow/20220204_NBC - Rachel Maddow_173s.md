# Pence Commits Republican Heresy; Accuses Trump Of Being Wrong On Negating Election Loss
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA)
*  Do not let anyone tell you there is a schism in the Republican Party or some sort of civil war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=0.0s)]
*  There are two factions fighting it out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=4.64s)]
*  There's Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and those couple of RNC members dejectedly voting no today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  And then there's everyone else in the party. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=12.48s)]
*  Because ever since that one time in 2016 that Donald Trump, right here, was forced in front of a camera [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=14.48s)]
*  to say he was wrong and apologized, the ironclad rule of Trumpism and therefore [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=20.0s)]
*  the ironclad rule of the modern Republican Party is that Donald Trump is never wrong. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=25.92s)]
*  Which is what made this today so remarkable. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=32.64s)]
*  January 6th was a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=38.08s)]
*  Lives were lost and many were injured. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=42.56s)]
*  But thanks to the courageous action of the Capitol Police and federal law enforcement, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  the violence was quelled, the Capitol was secured, and we reconvened the Congress that very same day [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=52.4s)]
*  to finish our work under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=61.04s)]
*  There are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=66.96s)]
*  Congress that I possess unilateral authority to reject electoral college votes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=71.6s)]
*  And I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=78.72s)]
*  But President Trump is wrong. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=86.72s)]
*  What? Honestly, I was surprised that Mike Pence was not vaporized by lightning on the spot. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=89.44s)]
*  I did not know a Republican could say the words, President Trump is wrong. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=96.4s)]
*  I thought it was like saying Beetlejuice or Candyman. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=101.12s)]
*  And while it's bracing to hear any Republican, let alone Donald Trump's vice president, say [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=104.72s)]
*  out loud that Donald Trump is wrong, you will note that Mike Pence also said that January 6th was, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=109.52s)]
*  quote, a dark day in the history of the United States. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=116.48s)]
*  That may not seem controversial. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=121.84s)]
*  It was certainly the national consensus not too long ago, but as of today, that kind of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=124.24s)]
*  language puts former Vice President Mike Pence at odds not just with Donald Trump, but with the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=127.6s)]
*  Republican Party as a whole. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  January 6th wasn't a dark day. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=133.83999999999997s)]
*  It was just legitimate political discourse, so says the Republican National Committee. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=137.2s)]
*  And if you so much as dare to participate in an investigation of that day, you are no longer [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  welcome in the Republican Party. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ5ytJ01zkA&t=162.64s)]
