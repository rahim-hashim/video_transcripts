# Similarities Suggest Coordination In Fake Elector Letters From Republicans In Five States
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc)
*  Now, I picked these five states to show you what the real electoral vote ascertainment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=0.0s)]
*  documents look like. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=6.96s)]
*  I picked these five because thanks to the watchdog group American Oversight, we now [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=7.96s)]
*  know that in all five of these states, Republicans also prepared forged fake documents that were [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=13.72s)]
*  sent to the government proclaiming that actually these other electors were the real electors [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=22.14s)]
*  from these states and they were casting the state's electoral college votes not for Biden, but for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=27.099999999999998s)]
*  Trump. Just watch this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=31.74s)]
*  Tell me if you notice something as I show you these. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=33.86s)]
*  So this is this is the documents from Georgia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=36.46s)]
*  In Georgia, that's the real electoral vote document on the left. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=39.78s)]
*  That's the forgery that was created by Republicans on the right. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=43.86s)]
*  Now let's do Nevada. In Nevada, that's the real one on the left. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=47.1s)]
*  And that's the fake one on the right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=52.06s)]
*  Here also is Wisconsin, where we reported on their forgery last month. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=55.220000000000006s)]
*  That's the real one on the left and the fake one on the right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  Here's Michigan, where we reported their forgery last night. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=62.220000000000006s)]
*  It's the real one on the left and the forgery on the right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  And lastly, here's Arizona, the real electoral vote document on the left and the fake one on the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=67.78s)]
*  right. Wasn't one state, wasn't three states where they did this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=73.18s)]
*  It was at least five states where we have now obtained forged documents created by [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=77.5s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=82.7s)]
*  And it's not like they sent them in saying, hey, we know we're not the real electors [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=84.9s)]
*  because Biden won here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  But here's our names for posterity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=89.9s)]
*  Here's our names for your records. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  No, they actually created these fake documents purporting to be the real certifications [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=93.5s)]
*  of them as electors. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=98.7s)]
*  I mean, here it is in the forged document from Georgia. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=101.06s)]
*  Look at the language. We, the undersigned, being the duly elected and qualified [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=103.42s)]
*  electors from the state of Georgia, do hereby certify. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=109.14s)]
*  You are not the duly elected and qualified electors for the state of Georgia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=113.3s)]
*  You are not. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=118.46s)]
*  But that language or language just like that is in all of these. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=120.66s)]
*  They all match. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=125.58s)]
*  Exactly. Same formatting, same font, same spacing, almost the exact same wording, all of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=128.54s)]
*  them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=135.5s)]
*  Now, you might remember on last night's show, we noted that the forged documents from [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=136.74s)]
*  Michigan and Wisconsin looked really similar, looked really alike. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=141.02s)]
*  But the Arizona one actually looked a little bit different. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=144.94s)]
*  Here's the amazing thing we discovered today about Arizona. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=148.26s)]
*  It looks like there were actually two sets of forged Electoral College documents sent [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=151.22s)]
*  in by Arizona Republicans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=156.18s)]
*  There was the sort of hoopty, different looking one that we showed you last night, which [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=158.18s)]
*  has notary stamps all over it and stuff. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=161.26s)]
*  That was the one that was obtained by Politico.com. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=163.3s)]
*  That we showed on the air here last night. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=165.26s)]
*  But now, as of today, thanks to American Oversight, we have obtained another one also [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  from Arizona, also a forgery, a whole different set of Republican imposters sent in this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  one in Arizona. And that one matches exactly all of the other forged electoral votes from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=176.1s)]
*  the six other states that we have found, excuse me, from the four other states that we [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=180.78s)]
*  have found. In these five states, one of the two forgeries from Arizona and those four [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=185.66s)]
*  other states, the forged documents all match. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=191.3s)]
*  This would therefore appear to be some kind of a coordinated effort. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  Or at least someone gave Republicans in all these states the same template for creating [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  these false records because they all have the exact same language. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=207.58s)]
*  They all have the same font. They all have the spacing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=210.9s)]
*  They all have the same formatting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=212.74s)]
*  That doesn't happen by accident. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=215.06s)]
*  Who organized this? Now, at the time this was happening, Pennsylvania, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=216.34s)]
*  Republicans, Pennsylvania is not one of the states we've been talking about here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  They actually put it put out a statement saying the Trump campaign had asked them to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=224.02s)]
*  create and certify, like within the Republican Party, a Republican set of electors [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=228.82s)]
*  for Pennsylvania. As they explained in their press release at the time, though, the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=236.94s)]
*  Pennsylvania Republicans didn't forge a document to make it look like they were the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  real electors. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=246.22s)]
*  They created a new document that said that they would become the electors if a court [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  ever ordered that the Republican side had actually won the election in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=252.18s)]
*  They didn't forge a document saying they believed they were. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=258.82s)]
*  They were they were purporting to be the official electors from Pennsylvania. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=261.82s)]
*  They created a document that said if a court ever says that Republicans won it at [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=266.06s)]
*  Pennsylvania, then will be the electors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=270.66s)]
*  Now, they say the Trump campaign advised them to create that alternate slate. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=273.62s)]
*  We're trying to track down the claims in that statement. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  If, in fact, the Trump campaign was commissioning Republicans not just to create [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  contingent slates of electors in case the results were ever reversed by courts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=284.58s)]
*  But if the Trump campaign was commissioning Republicans to forge official looking [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=290.74s)]
*  documents in multiple states where the wrong electors actually purported to be the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=294.26s)]
*  real electors, well, we will do our best to get to the bottom of this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=298.5s)]
*  We will do our best to get to the bottom of that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=301.98s)]
*  Now, one of the Trump officials who has pled the fifth, who has invoked his fifth [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  amendment rights against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying to the January [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=309.18s)]
*  6 investigation, his name is Jeffrey Clark, former former Trump Justice Department [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  official named Jeff Clark. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  Clark, you might remember, he's the one Trump reportedly tried to install as attorney [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  general right at the end. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  Best we can tell from public reporting, Trump seemed to like the cut of his gib [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=326.22s)]
*  after Jeff Clark drafted a letter that he insisted must go out on Justice Department [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=332.06s)]
*  letterhead to some of the states that Trump lost, including Georgia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=338.14000000000004s)]
*  This letter that was reportedly drafted by Jeff Clark was addressed to the state [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=342.38s)]
*  government in Georgia. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=348.54s)]
*  It was reportedly going to be sent to multiple other states as well. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  And the letter falsely stated that the U.S. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=353.02s)]
*  Justice Department was investigating serious credible claims of fraud in the election in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=355.66s)]
*  that state and that the state legislature there should therefore consider holding back [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=359.98s)]
*  the state's electoral college votes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  Jeff Clark drafted this letter from the U.S. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=368.38s)]
*  Justice Department to go to Georgia and other states. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=370.94s)]
*  And because the rest of the Justice Department wouldn't sign off on it and do it, Trump [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=375.74s)]
*  tried to install Jeff Clark as attorney general. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=380.22s)]
*  So Jeff Clark could send that letter and sign it attorney general. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=382.22s)]
*  I mean, had that happened, think about had the U.S. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=385.74s)]
*  Justice Department jumped in the way Trump wanted to the way Jeff Clark proposed, had [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=389.66s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=394.94000000000005s)]
*  Justice Department told Republican led states in formal letters, don't send in Biden [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=395.58000000000004s)]
*  electors on advice from the U.S. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=400.86s)]
*  Justice Department. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  You better not do that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=404.06s)]
*  How do you think Republican legislatures in those states would have acted? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=406.86s)]
*  It's one thing to get a, you know, off the wall call from Trump berating you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=409.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=417.34s)]
*  It's another thing for the U.S. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=417.82s)]
*  Justice Department to formally advise you on over the signature of the United States [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=419.02s)]
*  attorney general that you must not send in your electors because there's real problems [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  with the vote in your state. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  How would Republican legislatures have dealt with that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=428.29999999999995s)]
*  How would they have responded? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=431.02s)]
*  We would be living in a very different country right now. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=432.53999999999996s)]
*  Had that U.S. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=434.94s)]
*  Justice Department letter actually gone out to the states. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=435.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm not even sure all of us would be living in the same country as each other anymore. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=438.14s)]
*  Had that letter actually gone out. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=441.9s)]
*  That was just insanity. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=443.5s)]
*  That would have been as radical as Trump's other reported idea to send the National Guard [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  out to seize the voting machines and rerun the election. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  It would have been just that radical had the U.S. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=453.5s)]
*  Justice Department intervene to stop the administration of the election in that way. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=455.5s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=462.7s)]
*  That insane draft letter, that letter explicitly describes these forged slates of electors [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=463.5s)]
*  from multiple states. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=472.38s)]
*  It says in the middle of the letter, quote, the department believes, meaning the Department [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=474.14s)]
*  of Justice believes that in Georgia and several other states, both a slate of electors supporting [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=477.74s)]
*  Biden and a separate slate of electors supporting Trump gathered on December 14th at the proper [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=483.66s)]
*  location to cast their ballots and that both sets of those ballots have been transmitted [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=489.26s)]
*  to Washington, D.C. to be opened by Vice President Pence. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=493.26s)]
*  In fact, I don't know why the Justice Department believed that to be true, but that was correct. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=497.98s)]
*  We now know that draft letter was dated December 28th. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=503.18s)]
*  How did that guy that that Trump guy at the Justice Department know that two weeks earlier, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=509.58s)]
*  Republicans in at least five states had in fact created these forged elector documents? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=514.3s)]
*  Did the Trump Justice Department know about it because they helped Republicans in those [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=523.26s)]
*  states do it? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=526.46s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=529.02s)]
*  But somebody helped him do it because they all filed the exact same document in the same [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=530.38s)]
*  font in the same spacing with the exact same language. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=534.78s)]
*  So somebody helped them do it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=537.26s)]
*  We are working on figuring it out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=539.02s)]
*  I will also just tell you one other thing about this. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=541.26s)]
*  In a lot of these states, for whatever reason, in addition to the assertion that these were [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=544.62s)]
*  the duly elected electors from these states, which was a lie, a lot of them also included a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=549.5s)]
*  bunch of substitutions, meaning that the people who were originally supposed to be Trump electors [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=554.7s)]
*  from those states had Trump won. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=560.22s)]
*  The original would be Trump electors had their names dropped and they were replaced with [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=562.14s)]
*  other names, with other Republicans who did sign these documents. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=567.5s)]
*  In almost every state that did this, people who were originally supposed to be Trump electors [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=572.3s)]
*  got replaced with these other Republicans before the forged documents were sent in. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=577.34s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=580.86s)]
*  We're trying to get to the bottom of that too, but I can tell you at first pass that in at least [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=582.5400000000001s)]
*  one state, at least one of the Republicans who was substituted for, whose name was dropped [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=586.62s)]
*  as an elector, one Republican who was replaced by somebody else before that forged document [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=593.34s)]
*  was signed and sent in, that Republican told us this evening that that substitution was deliberate. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=599.1s)]
*  That person had their name taken off the list and replaced because that person did not want [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=605.1s)]
*  to be part of that effort to forge a slate of electors that was not the real electors from that [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=610.0600000000001s)]
*  state. It's one of the Republican electors who was replaced in Georgia. That person told us this [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=615.82s)]
*  tonight, quote, I knew the meeting was taking place, but I did not wish to attend. I did not wish to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=622.38s)]
*  give my electoral vote knowing that President Biden had already been certified by the state. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=628.3000000000001s)]
*  Which you'd hope would be the reaction from every Republican approached to sign their name as if [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=635.26s)]
*  they were a real elector in a state that was not won by their candidate, but that in fact was won [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=641.9s)]
*  by the other guy. So they weren't going to be electors at all. As we reported here in December, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=647.26s)]
*  there is an open question in Wisconsin as to whether the forgery there is going to be pursued [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=652.94s)]
*  by the state election board or indeed by state prosecutors. Those people in Wisconsin said they [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=657.9s)]
*  were the state's electors and they were not, and they tried to pass themselves off that way. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=663.34s)]
*  That would appear to be against the law in Wisconsin. It is an open question as to whether [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  or not that is going to be pursued as a criminal matter by the state election board. This is new. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=671.74s)]
*  In Michigan, the Detroit News has just reported that the matter is part of an ongoing investigation [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=677.18s)]
*  by the state attorney general's office. Here's the Detroit News. New reporting. A spokeswoman [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=683.1s)]
*  for the Michigan attorney general declined to discuss the legality of the Republican certification [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=687.1s)]
*  in detail, saying it was part of an ongoing probe. Quote, that matter is part of an investigation [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=692.54s)]
*  into election-related matters. We are not currently in a position to share specifics as the review [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=697.98s)]
*  remains ongoing. So in terms of whether or not the people who did this are individually going to get [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=703.5799999999999s)]
*  in trouble, open question in at least two states. I don't know about the others. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=710.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTpIRevl_Fc&t=722.54s)]
