# Justin Jones reinstated to Tennessee legislature after expulsion by Republicans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8)
*  It happened within the course of about an hour or so across two different seats of government, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=0.0s)]
*  first in the city of Nashville and then in the state Capitol. But this is what it looked like. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=5.2s)]
*  This was late today when Tennessee Legislator Justin Jones, who was recently expelled from the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  state legislature by Republicans, this is what it looked like today over the course of about an hour [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=16.16s)]
*  when he retook his seat. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=21.76s)]
*  Thank you, Vice Mayor. I would like to nominate Representative Justin Jones. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=24.08s)]
*  Votes are in. Mr. Clark, close the machines, take the vote. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  Ayes 36, no zero, no abstention. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=36.72s)]
*  By the Constitution of this state, so powerful. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=42.0s)]
*  So powerful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=46.8s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=48.0s)]
*  Everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it slide. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=52.16s)]
*  Oh, everywhere I go, I'm gonna let it slide. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=58.4s)]
*  No exposure, no attempt to silence us will stop us, but only galvanize and strengthen our movement. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=76.48s)]
*  And we continue to show up in the people's house. Power to the people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=81.84s)]
*  Just last week, Republicans in the Tennessee Legislature voted to expel two young men of color, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  two Democratic members of that body for participating in a protest against gun violence [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  at the Capitol. They committed the grave crime of being loud with other protesters. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=103.44s)]
*  Among other things, that action by Tennessee Republicans, the extreme action to expel them [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  as legislators. Well, it meant technically that local government in both of those two men's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=114.48s)]
*  districts would have to appoint somebody to fill those now empty seats in the interim until there [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=119.84s)]
*  can be a special election. Well, fine then. Today at about 5 30 Eastern time, the Nashville [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Metro Council appointed Justin Jones to be his own replacement in the legislature. They voted [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=130.72s)]
*  to send him back to the seat from which he was just expelled. The vote, you heard it there was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=137.12s)]
*  36 yes, zero no. Less than an hour later, by 6 15 p.m. Eastern, Justin Jones had been sworn in again [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  as a member of the Tennessee State Legislature in front of tons of people who had showed up to the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=150.96s)]
*  Capitol to cheer him on. By 6 30 p.m. by just 15 minutes later, he had marched arm in arm with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=155.44s)]
*  those supporters to the doors of the legislature to in fact retake his seat. Now a duly appointed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=161.6s)]
*  member of the Tennessee State Legislature. I should tell you, we expect the county government in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=168.48s)]
*  Memphis and Shelby County to take a similar vote on reinstalling the other ousted member Justin [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=173.12s)]
*  Pearson two days from now this Wednesday. Joining us now live from Tennessee is the newly reinstated [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=178.32s)]
*  Tennessee State Representative Justin Jones. Representative Jones, congratulations, sir, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=186.0s)]
*  and thank you for being here tonight. Thank you so much, Rachel. I have to imagine that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=190.0s)]
*  with everything that you have been through over these past few days, this has to have been a very [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=197.44s)]
*  emotional afternoon and evening. I do just if you forgive me, I just sort of want to ask you how you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=201.44s)]
*  are feeling and how it felt to be back in that chamber. Well, it has definitely been an emotional [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=206.16s)]
*  past few days, but I am hopeful. I'm exhausted, but I'm hopeful that we are seeing a resurrection [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=213.28s)]
*  of reconstruction here in the South, that the decision that was made on Thursday, this immoral [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=220.56s)]
*  decision, this unconstitutional decision was not the final decision that the people of my county [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=225.6s)]
*  government and thus of my district spoke. And I'm honored to be representing them because my concern [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=230.8s)]
*  was that District 52, over 78,000 people would not have a voice. And so I was honored to walk [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=236.32s)]
*  into that chamber today and be able to cast a vote for my district and for the people who sent [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=241.84s)]
*  me there to be their voice. Representative Jones, you spoke with my colleague, Simone Sanders, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=246.48s)]
*  over the weekend. I heard that interview and it was interesting to hear you talk with her [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  about concerns that despite the fact that your local county government was effectively reinstalling [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=257.04s)]
*  you, making you your own interim successor, there were worries that attorneys from the speaker were [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=262.48s)]
*  threatening that you might not be receded until next session. There have been worries expressed [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=269.52s)]
*  that Republicans in the legislature would seek to expel you again and throw you out again on the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=275.68s)]
*  same grounds as before. Are those concerns gone now? Are all those matters settled as far as you [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  can tell? Yeah, well, you know, that's still yet to be determined. I'm grateful that my attorney, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  one of whom includes the team, includes former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, sent a letter at 10 [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=293.28s)]
*  a.m. Central to the House Speaker informing them that they do not, you know, want to see any [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=298.32s)]
*  obstruction of me, you know, representing the people of District 52, sent a letter to put them on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=303.44s)]
*  notice that, you know, we would respond if that was the case. And I think that had a big impact [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=308.08s)]
*  on the speaker as well as the thousands of people gathered here today, multiracial, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  intergenerational, gathered from the metro courthouse to the legislature to let them know [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=316.8s)]
*  that the world is watching and that we're not going to allow their attacks on democracy to happen [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  in the comfort of silence and that we're still calling for action on common sense gun laws. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=325.52s)]
*  That's what this was all about in the beginning. And so the speaker's threats against our democracy [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=329.44s)]
*  are being met with this resurrection of a movement for multiracial democracy that is really [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=334.08s)]
*  happening here in Nashville and that I think is going to have reverberations across the South. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=338.64s)]
*  After you were sworn in again today, I know that you called for the speaker, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=345.28s)]
*  Speaker Sexton, to resign effectively for having orchestrated this and also for his lack of action [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=349.84s)]
*  or indeed regressive action when it comes to gun violence. I have to ask you, is that something that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=356.56s)]
*  you're going to continue to push for? Do you have any sense that the speaker may actually regret [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=363.2s)]
*  the decision to expel you and your colleague given the response that it's had in recent days and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=368.88s)]
*  including, as you say, those thousands of people in a multiracial, multigenerational display today, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=374.8s)]
*  out today to support you? Definitely. I mean, this House speaker, there's a different energy [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=380.24s)]
*  in the Capitol today. And I actually was on the elevator with the member who filed the expulsion [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  papers against me, Representative Bud Hosey. And I asked him, you know, did you learn anything from [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=391.12s)]
*  this experience? And he was silent. I think this is a time of reflection for the Republican [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=394.88s)]
*  leadership that they were so drunk and arrogant with power that they are being humble to say that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  attacks may have been successful in the past. But this is a new day, a new time in Tennessee. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=405.2s)]
*  And there's a new movement rising up that the South will rise anew. And so the House speaker, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=411.04s)]
*  I definitely will join with the coalition of people across the state calling for his [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  resignation because he is the greatest enemy toward democracy. But more importantly, what we're calling [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=419.2s)]
*  for is the restoration of democracy in the people's house. We don't need a speaker who shuts off [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=424.32s)]
*  microphones, who cuts off members from speaking, who won't even let us vote if we go join, you know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=428.48s)]
*  those protesting who will cut off our voting machines, kicks you off committee. We have a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=433.2s)]
*  speaker who does not, who represents the opposite of democracy, which is autocracy. And he has not [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=436.56s)]
*  fit to serve in that role. And so I join with the members of the community calling for his resignation. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=441.68s)]
*  Tennessee State Representative Justin Jones newly reinstalled in his seat tonight by vote of his [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=447.28s)]
*  county council, who has appointed him his own successor, which to me has a little poetry in it [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=452.64s)]
*  that seems resonant, given your eloquence, sir, as a representative for your constituents [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=458.32s)]
*  and an advocate for the causes that are closest to you. Tennessee State Representative Justin [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=464.56s)]
*  Jones, good luck to you. Thanks for your time tonight, sir. Thank you. Thanks, Rachel. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=468.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcW7NDEPd8&t=488.24s)]
