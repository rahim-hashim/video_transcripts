# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 12
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8)
*  Administrator Samantha Power joins us live now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam Administrator, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=2.56s)]
*  It's really nice to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=4.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=5.76s)]
*  It's really nice to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=6.76s)]
*  Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=7.76s)]
*  So President Biden did use the word genocide when describing the situation in Ukraine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=10.08s)]
*  He used that word for the first time today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=14.64s)]
*  I want to get your perspective on what that means for a U.S. president to use that word. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=16.36s)]
*  Does that change the U.S. posture in this conflict? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=22.68s)]
*  Does it change our perceived responsibilities? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=25.52s)]
*  Well, let me just say that from the beginning of the war, we've seen two things. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=29.56s)]
*  Extraordinary brutality. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=36.12s)]
*  And I say that as somebody, as you said, who's studied mass atrocities and genocide over time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=38.76s)]
*  I mean, I didn't think I was capable of being shocked by the actions of violent, brutal leaders and their coldness to human life. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=44.0s)]
*  But even though we warned that a lot of this was coming when you see mothers digging their sons out of wells or you see bodies being burnt to hide evidence or just to destroy the will of families who have to watch it happen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=54.8s)]
*  I mean, it is searing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  What is happening is grotesque and horrific. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=72.16s)]
*  At the same time, from the very beginning of the war, in part because Putin projected at least some of his intentions in terms of launching the military invasion and being willing to target civilians and leaders and journalists and NGO professionals. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=75.44s)]
*  We've been working with the Ukrainians to help document the atrocities underway, which started on day one when they began hitting residential areas and hospitals and the like. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=94.8s)]
*  So in terms of the formal legal determination, inevitably that is going to occur in a courtroom or through an elaborate legal process where we gather testimonies, combine it with intelligence, where we can show intent to destroy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=108.16s)]
*  A national ethnic or religious group as such, in this case, a national group, as the president said, that will come. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=124.96s)]
*  But I think what the president is speaking to is to what we all see with our own eyes, which is it's intentionally trying to wipe out Ukrainians because they are Ukrainians. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=130.8s)]
*  And I think that was why that determination by him was made. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=140.2s)]
*  But he was the first to say, look, we have a process we're building toward, you know, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry that's been set up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=144.96s)]
*  The International Criminal Court has announced that it's opening an investigation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=151.92s)]
*  So there will be plenty of venues to gather everything in one place and run through this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=155.72s)]
*  But but the facts of what we see every day and above all, what the Ukrainians are experiencing every day are playing its day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=160.04s)]
*  Do you honestly think that he cares about being accused of war crimes, that he sees any realistic threat of being held accountable for some type of warfare that might be described as criminal as opposed to the war itself? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=167.6s)]
*  Which arguably is criminal as a whole. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=181.08s)]
*  I mean, it just it feels like almost an academic determination at this point, especially for a dictator who doesn't ever plan on leaving power. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's a fair question for sure, because we see the kind of culture of impunity that he's embedded himself in for a very long time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  We see the long table and the yes men and the sycophants and anybody who raises a voice of dissent, whether on TV or in his inner circle, you know, we don't see them again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=204.4s)]
*  So so I hear you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=217.6s)]
*  But I just offer a personal reflection on that question, which is I got my start in Bosnia as a kid reporter documenting some of these crimes on the ground, not with an eye to legal determinations, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=219.68s)]
*  but just as a as a simple freelance war correspondent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=232.92s)]
*  And I can say having interacted with the big guys of that time, the brutal war criminals of that time, the Rokomladić, the Slobodan Milosevic, the Radovan Karadžić, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=237.16s)]
*  you know, names that people aren't really talking about anymore, but they carry themselves in the same way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  They sat at those long tables. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=254.0s)]
*  They cut people off the air who offered dissenting views. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  You know, they only surround themselves with yes men. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  Oh, you're so smart, President Milosevic. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=262.36s)]
*  You're so this, you're so that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=264.0s)]
*  And I never dreamed that history would turn and that these three individuals would end up in in in the Hague, and nor did the victims of their of their atrocities. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=265.48s)]
*  So it isn't to say that inevitably history will repeat itself, but it is to say that history is long. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=277.2s)]
*  And sadly, you know, this war every day that this war goes on seven weeks, every day that the the circle of economic consequences [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=283.56s)]
*  combined with the prospect of the sort of Damocles in a legal sense or in a judicial accountability sense every day that that doesn't impact Putin's calculus in the here and now is one day too many. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  So we all understand that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=304.0s)]
*  But I think to think that just because he's at a long table now and looking like he is standing immune to the consequences of his brutality, I think could prove short sighted. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=305.76s)]
*  Ukrainian military this week is given unusual warning about Moldova. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=320.32s)]
*  They warned that Russia, they believe Russia may be about to do something in Moldova that they're then going to blame on Ukraine to justify Russia expanding [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=324.68s)]
*  the war and invading that country to basically their warning that Russia is looking for a fake justification to keep moving, to keep expanding the war into into neighboring countries that they've had their eye on for a while. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=333.96s)]
*  What do you make of those claims from Ukraine and from the overall threat that Putin doesn't even plan on containing this just to Ukraine, despite the damage he's already done there? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, again, one would never wish to underestimate either Putin's brutality or the counterproductive decisions he could make in order to set back his own war effort. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=354.48s)]
*  Right. I mean, he is not handled this well and to sort of create another theater when his troops are not managing in the theater that they are in other than committing atrocities. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=368.6s)]
*  You know, you can't rule that out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=379.0s)]
*  But I will tell you the same thing I told the Moldovan president and that President Biden and everyone on the team have conveyed, which is at this point, we see no evidence of plans of that nature. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=380.24s)]
*  And we're watching very carefully. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=392.4s)]
*  If you're Moldovan and you're in a small country of under three million people, already part of your country has been occupied by Russian forces unjustly. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=395.12s)]
*  Your sovereignty has been undermined. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=403.72s)]
*  You should know you're led by an amazing pair of female presidents and prime minister to technocrat anti corruption reformers who very much want to integrate Moldova into Europe. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=406.04s)]
*  Putin hates that, of course, and they've taken great strides to fight the oligarchs and to fight corruption. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=419.32s)]
*  Putin hates that, too. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=425.48s)]
*  So there is a jitteriness, understandably, in Moldova. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=427.08s)]
*  And again, we can't rule anything like that out, given that Putin clearly has ambitions to recreate some world that no longer exists anymore and to impede progress toward European integration for young people and others who want the democratic freedoms, the rule of law that so many of us cherish. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=431.2s)]
*  And so can't rule it out, not seeing it at the moment. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=453.48s)]
*  Certainly, our work with the Moldovan government right now is aimed actually at focusing on their economic security and stability because they have lost export markets, import markets. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=458.16s)]
*  Their fuel prices are up three hundred and sixty percent, if you can believe it, since the war started. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  So this is a government that's doing all of the right things. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=475.0s)]
*  And already the impact of this war, well and apart from any new military dimension to it, is really jeopardizing an incredibly important journey that they are on toward democratic progress. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=478.08s)]
*  One of the easy and I think basically false cliches about the media, about the news media, is that the news used to be way better, that the news used to not be controversial, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=491.48s)]
*  that the news used to be always spoken in a calm, authoritative voice with no snark and no attitude. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=503.28s)]
*  And everybody agreed it was just the facts. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=510.84s)]
*  And that's as far as it went. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  You hear that kind of facile cliche about what the news used to be like here all the time. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=516.04s)]
*  You hear even very smart people assert that that was true about the media in the good old days. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=520.64s)]
*  And couldn't we just go back to that? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=525.92s)]
*  The problem with that is if you actually go back and listen to what the news was like in the good old days, it blows that thesis out of the water almost instantly. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=528.76s)]
*  Take, for example, the dripping sarcasm in this news reel from the aforementioned good old days. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=538.84s)]
*  Peaceful Finland, that distant northern country of lakes and fjords of sailing ships and summer bathing beaches has been invaded and bombed. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=547.48s)]
*  The long crisis of apparently futile negotiation with Moscow has ended in attack by overwhelming power. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=557.04s)]
*  The reason for this? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=563.24s)]
*  The Soviet, a nation of some 180 millions, has been threatened by the four millions in Finland. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=564.52s)]
*  The huge Russian Air Force, probably the biggest in the world, fears for its very existence. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=570.16s)]
*  And the Red Fleet, no doubt, has been gravely menaced by Finland's two or three warships. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=576.4s)]
*  What are the real facts? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=581.96s)]
*  Ah, the good old days of voice of God, authoritative news with no snark, right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=584.44s)]
*  That was a 1939 British newsreel just dripping with sarcasm as to why on earth the Soviet Union felt like it could convince anybody that the reason it needed to invade the neighboring nation of Finland was that Finland was some sort of threat to it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  When Finland obviously was no threat. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=606.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, Soviet Union, just like Putin is claiming about Ukraine now, the Soviet Union did claim that they were somehow in mortal danger from the much, much, much smaller country on their border. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=610.36s)]
*  This country with a much, much, much smaller military, a country that was doing nothing at all to menace its much larger neighbor to the east. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=621.6s)]
*  Just like what Putin is saying about Ukraine, the Soviet Union said the same thing about Finland in 1939. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=629.72s)]
*  But the Soviet Army did invade Finland in late 1939. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=635.4399999999999s)]
*  And it appears that their plan was to topple the government in Finland, probably in a matter of a few days. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=640.6s)]
*  They thought it would not be hard. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=646.36s)]
*  The Soviet military went in by land, by sea and by air. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=648.76s)]
*  They used about 100,000 troops, which was huge. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=652.4s)]
*  Their military just dwarfed the military force that the Finns had to defend themselves. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=655.88s)]
*  And their plan was that the Soviet Union would basically just take Finland. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  Install their own puppet pro-Soviet government or maybe just just even annex Finland, make Finland part of the USSR, erase it as a sovereign country. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=665.28s)]
*  And again, they didn't think it would be hard. They thought it would take maybe a few days. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=674.8s)]
*  It did not work that way. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=678.92s)]
*  The Finns in 1939 fought them off furiously. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=681.12s)]
*  I mean, there are at the time there were four million, less than four million people in Finland, one hundred and eighty million people in the Soviet Union and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=685.8s)]
*  proportionate militaries to those populations. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=692.68s)]
*  The Finns were outnumbered. They were wildly outgunned. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=696.48s)]
*  But they were also resourceful. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=700.64s)]
*  They were fighting on their own home turf and they were more motivated than you can possibly imagine. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=702.48s)]
*  They were defending their homes. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=706.76s)]
*  That was called the Winter War. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=710.72s)]
*  It started when the Soviets invaded in late 1939. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=713.48s)]
*  I'm sure Stalin thought his forces would be home for the new year. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=716.64s)]
*  Instead, it stretched on into 1940. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=720.56s)]
*  The Finns wore this remarkable white winter camouflage. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=724.68s)]
*  They fought on skis and snowshoes and they just cut down the invading Soviet forces. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=729.2399999999999s)]
*  Finland, in fact, didn't have its own air force at all, but they still managed to shoot down dozens of Soviet airplanes. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=737.3599999999999s)]
*  In one famous battle in central Finland, it was six thousand Finnish troops versus more than twenty thousand Soviet troops. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=745.8s)]
*  And the Finns just routed them despite being outnumbered to such a massive extent. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=753.0799999999999s)]
*  The Soviets suffered huge casualties, hundreds of thousands of casualties, ultimately, in their Finland invasion. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=758.5999999999999s)]
*  And the Western world was shocked. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  The Western world had thought that the Soviets would have won in just a few days, too. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=769.16s)]
*  The Soviets thought that, but everybody else looking in thought that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  When the Finns put up this unexpected and incredibly effective resistance, they became a cause celeb all over the United States, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=776.1999999999999s)]
*  even though our government didn't send them nearly as much practical help as they wanted. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  We still cheered them on. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=788.0s)]
*  Well, in the end, although it didn't go the way he expected it to at the beginning, Stalin regrouped. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=791.16s)]
*  He sent in not another hundred thousand Soviet troops, but more like half a million Soviet troops to get the job done. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=798.48s)]
*  The population of Finland was less than four million people in the whole country. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=805.7600000000001s)]
*  Stalin had to send in a half million troops to finish the invasion in the end. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=809.6400000000001s)]
*  But the Finns still fought. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=815.6s)]
*  They held their ground for weeks, even after the half million Soviet troops arrived in that second wave of the invasion. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=817.2s)]
*  The Finns were able to hold on ultimately for more than a hundred days. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=823.76s)]
*  And in the end, it did end. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=829.76s)]
*  The Finnish government was not toppled. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=831.68s)]
*  They negotiated a peace with the Soviets and the negotiated settlement was bad for Finland, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=834.04s)]
*  but it was nowhere near as bad as what Stalin had intended for when he invaded in the first place and just thought he'd run a rough shot over the place. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=839.24s)]
*  In the negotiated settlement that ended the Winter War, Finland did have to cede about 10 percent of its territory to the Soviets, which is bad. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=846.88s)]
*  But they stayed Finland. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=857.32s)]
*  They kept their independence as a nation. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=860.12s)]
*  They kept their sovereignty. They kept their way of government. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=862.0s)]
*  They even got to keep their army. They got to stay who they are. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=864.96s)]
*  And they also never forgot it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=870.2800000000001s)]
*  And because Russia invaded Ukraine, support has spiked in Finland and also in neighboring Sweden for those two countries to now join NATO. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=872.52s)]
*  They never wanted to before, but now they do. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=882.64s)]
*  One of the million different contradictory justifications Putin's given for why he needed to invade Ukraine, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  one that you often hear parroted by people in this country apologizing for Putin, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=892.52s)]
*  is this idea that Putin felt cramped by NATO, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=896.84s)]
*  that too many countries to the west of Russia had joined NATO. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=901.24s)]
*  They were too close to Russian borders. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=905.04s)]
*  So he had to invade Ukraine to ensure that Ukraine would never join NATO. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=907.2s)]
*  He's made this case that the reason for the war, at least one reason for this invasion, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=912.04s)]
*  is that Putin couldn't stand the feeling of having any NATO countries right up against Russia's borders. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=916.12s)]
*  Well, congratulations, Mr. Putin. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=922.16s)]
*  Guess what you got for invading Ukraine? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=924.72s)]
*  Even if Finland alone joins NATO, you will have just more than doubled the amount of Russian land border with NATO countries. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=926.72s)]
*  Well done. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=935.84s)]
*  Sweden's ruling party, the Social Democrats, they've always been against Sweden joining NATO, as has the Swedish public. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=938.52s)]
*  But now both the Swedish public and that ruling party in Sweden have changed their minds. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=947.24s)]
*  In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party put out a statement yesterday that said, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  Sweden's security position changed fundamentally. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=956.72s)]
*  And so even though they have always been opposed to Sweden joining NATO, they're now expected to favor it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=960.64s)]
*  And the Swedish government is expected to decide on applying for NATO membership as soon as this summer. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=967.64s)]
*  Even sooner than that, it looks like Finland is going to make its request to join. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=972.76s)]
*  And NATO will say yes when these countries ask. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=977.28s)]
*  One recent poll in Finland shows that even though just a couple of years ago, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=980.72s)]
*  a majority of the Finnish public didn't want their country to join NATO since Putin invaded Ukraine, they're sure in favor of it now. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=984.96s)]
*  The Finnish people are now 68 percent in favor of joining. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=992.96s)]
*  And that number spikes to 77 percent in favor of joining if the Finnish government studies the issue and decides to recommend it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=996.2s)]
*  Well, next week, the Finnish government is going to present a security review on this issue to their parliament. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1003.4s)]
*  A recent survey of members of the Finnish parliament says that of the 200 MPs, they've got the 200 members of parliament. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1009.0s)]
*  194 are in favor of Finland joining NATO. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1016.8s)]
*  That's 194 in favor, six against, which means the Finnish government is going to recommend that they join NATO and the Finnish public is going to support them. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1021.56s)]
*  And it's going to pass. And it's going to pass soon. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1034.52s)]
*  Apparently, a former prime minister of Finland tells the AFP this week that it is a foregone conclusion that Finland will request NATO membership and the request will happen within the next few weeks. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1037.08s)]
*  It'll happen in time for the next NATO summit in June. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1049.4s)]
*  Now, Russia has responded by threatening that there's going to be consequences if that happens, consequences including military consequences, if two new nations join NATO. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1053.88s)]
*  But these aren't just any two countries. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1064.28s)]
*  I mean, particularly Finland. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  Since the Winter War in 1940, Finland has been getting ready for those kinds of threats from this country that invaded them before. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1067.96s)]
*  And at least now is implicitly threatening that they might do it again. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1077.16s)]
*  Finland is actually remarkably ready for those threats. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1081.24s)]
*  In Finland, the country maintains secure stockpiles of at least a six month supply of all major food grains, things like oats and wheat. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1085.56s)]
*  They also maintain a six month stockpile of all major fuel supplies. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1094.4399999999998s)]
*  They require all pharmaceutical companies in Finland to keep secure stockpiles of several months worth of all major imported drugs. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1098.4399999999998s)]
*  Every building above a certain size in Finland is required to have a bomb shelter. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1107.24s)]
*  That's on top of a national plan that repurposes underground parking garage and ice ranks and pools into civilian shelters in the event of invasion. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1111.4799999999998s)]
*  In the country's capital, in Helsinki, they have built 10 million square meters of underground space underneath Helsinki proper. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1120.28s)]
*  It includes and it's not just like shelters and subway stations. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1130.6s)]
*  It's an art museum and a church and a huge swimming complex and a mall and a go-karting track. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1133.96s)]
*  You know, you might need it. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1141.08s)]
*  Also a huge drinking water reservoir all underground, all beneath the capital city of Helsinki. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1142.6s)]
*  For safety. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1149.88s)]
*  One former defense minister in Finland telling the Financial Times this week how, quote, detailed planning is in place for how to handle an invasion, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1152.76s)]
*  including the deployment of fighter jets to remote roads around the country, the laying of mines and key shipping lanes, the preparation of land defenses such as blowing up bridges. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1159.96s)]
*  He says, quote, all armed forces headquarters are located in hillsides under 30 to 40 meters of granite. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1169.24s)]
*  So they're ready. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1179.24s)]
*  And here we've got Russia failing in Ukraine. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1181.64s)]
*  They thought they would run roughshod over Ukraine. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1185.0s)]
*  They thought they would walk in. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1187.88s)]
*  They take Kiev within days. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1188.8400000000001s)]
*  They thought they would decapitate the Ukrainian government and take over the country in less than a week. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzKOuZDobC8&t=1191.3200000000002s)]
