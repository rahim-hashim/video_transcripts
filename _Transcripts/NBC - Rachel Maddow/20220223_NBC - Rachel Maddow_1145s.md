# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 22
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo)
*  In the summer of 2016, at the Republican National Convention that was preparing to nominate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump to be the GOP candidate for president, the Republican Party suddenly and inexplicably [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=5.16s)]
*  changed its long-standing policy platform on the issue of Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=11.32s)]
*  The two countries had been fighting each other in a simmering conflict for the previous two [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=16.66s)]
*  years ever since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began supporting Russian separatists [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  in eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=26.42s)]
*  That summer, in 2016, the Republican Party officially renounced support for arming Ukraine [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=28.36s)]
*  in that fight against Russia. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=35.28s)]
*  One RNC delegate said it was Trump himself who directed that change in the platform. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=37.42s)]
*  It was such a weird, specific thing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=41.84s)]
*  But it was just the beginning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=45.5s)]
*  We soon learned that Trump campaign officials were entertaining at least two different proposals [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=46.5s)]
*  to hand over Ukrainian territory to Russia. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=51.92s)]
*  The Mueller investigation found that Trump campaign chair, who before taking the job [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=54.72s)]
*  with Trump for free, had worked for Ukraine's deposed pro-Russian autocrat, had multiple [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=58.96s)]
*  discussions with a Russian intelligence officer about a so-called Ukraine peace plan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=65.56s)]
*  Trump's campaign chair himself admitted the plan was a backdoor means for Russia to control [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=72.24s)]
*  eastern Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=77.18s)]
*  Another so-called peace plan was delivered to the desk of President Trump's National [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Security Advisor during his first month in office, hand-delivered by Donald Trump's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=83.8s)]
*  personal lawyer. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=89.08s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=90.28s)]
*  It too proposed handing over eastern Ukraine and lifting sanctions on Russia for having [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=91.72s)]
*  invaded Crimea. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  So you see, if you give Putin everything he wants, voila, you shall have peace. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  As soon as Trump took office in 2017, his administration actually set about secretly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  sanctions on Russia until Congress found out about it and blocked it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=109.76s)]
*  Trump then threatened to veto a bill sanctioning Russia for meddling in the 2016 election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=114.2s)]
*  He only grudgingly signed it because Congress passed it by big bipartisan veto-proof margins. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=119.68s)]
*  Then he eagerly set up a summit in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin, where he stood next to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=128.24s)]
*  the Russian leader and sided with him over American intelligence agencies on the issue [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  of that very Russian election meddling. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=138.48s)]
*  Trump spent his whole term in office disparaging NATO, yelling at our allies, advocating for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  Putin to be invited back to world meetings from which he had been barred specifically [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  because he had invaded Ukraine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=153.0s)]
*  Oh, right, and he was actually impeached for a scheme in which he suspended American aid [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=155.16s)]
*  to Ukraine, ousted the American ambassador there, and generally isolated and threatened [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  the Ukrainian government. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  So today, when Donald Trump put out a statement saying, quote, I know Vladimir Putin very [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=168.28s)]
*  well and he would never have done this during the Trump administration, what he is doing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=173.52s)]
*  now, no way. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=178.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, let's just take a moment to stop spit laughing your beverage through [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=180.84s)]
*  your nose. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=186.8s)]
*  Second of all, why would Putin have invaded Ukraine back then anyway when he had so many [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=188.56s)]
*  irons in the fire in the Trump administration, so many potential ways to get Ukraine to capitulate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  without actively invading ways that the American president, Donald Trump, was helping him with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  this apparent new line from Trump and his allies that Putin was too intimidated by strong [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=204.72s)]
*  virile Donald Trump to dare invade Ukraine while he was president. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  Numerous congressional Republicans are now claiming that Putin is invading Ukraine now [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  because Joe Biden is weak. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Not like Donald Trump, who stands up to Putin. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=221.92s)]
*  In fact, here is Donald Trump just this afternoon on right wing radio, demonstrating his toughness [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  with Putin. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  I went in yesterday and there was a television screen and I said, this is genius. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine of Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=238.88s)]
*  Putin declares it as independent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=245.32s)]
*  Oh, that's wonderful. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  So Putin is now saying it's independent, a large section of Ukraine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=249.5s)]
*  I said, how smart is that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=255.02s)]
*  And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=257.02s)]
*  That's the strongest peace force. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=259.86s)]
*  We could use that on our southern border. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=261.4s)]
*  That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=263.78s)]
*  There were more army tanks than I've ever seen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=265.82s)]
*  They're going to keep peace all right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=267.82s)]
*  You got to say that's pretty savvy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=269.14s)]
*  It's pretty savvy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=271.02s)]
*  That is genius. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=273.26s)]
*  How smart is that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=274.26s)]
*  Aren't you just bowled over by his toughness? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=275.26s)]
*  That's a former president of the United States saying today not only that Vladimir Putin's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=278.98s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine is wonderful, genius and savvy, but admiring Putin's display of military [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=282.26s)]
*  might and suggesting that the United States ought to emulate it on our own border. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=287.54s)]
*  Yes, Vladimir Putin must be so relieved that Donald Trump is no longer president. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=292.5s)]
*  Joining us now is Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor in the Obama administration. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=298.5s)]
*  Ben, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=302.38s)]
*  It's remarkable that these lies just flow as quickly as they do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=304.78s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to those comments, not just from Donald Trump calling Putin's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=309.06s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine genius and savvy, but the idea that there are lots of Republicans [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=313.5s)]
*  who are getting behind this idea today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=317.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=320.78s)]
*  I mean, well, first of all, we have to recognize that these comments will play in a loop on [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=321.78s)]
*  Russian state media and Russian propaganda. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=328.3s)]
*  That's already been the case with Tucker Carlson segments, with Mike Pompeo lavishing praise [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=331.1s)]
*  on Putin. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=335.82s)]
*  And that's certainly going to be the case with Trump. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=336.92s)]
*  And that's going to be an important part of Vladimir Putin trying to convince his public [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=338.9s)]
*  that what he's doing is not a massive overreach that is bad for Russia, but is actually something [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=343.14s)]
*  that enjoys support from around the world and that positions him as a strong leader [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=347.44s)]
*  and a strong man, which is how he wants to be seen. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=351.82s)]
*  So this is something that is a propaganda gift to Putin. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=355.54s)]
*  It's also just kind of patently absurd. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=359.74s)]
*  But I think if we're honest about this, there are elements of the Republican Party that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=362.06s)]
*  truly admire Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=366.62s)]
*  He represents the type of leadership, kind of shameless capacity and will to power that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=368.38s)]
*  he embodies is something that Trump has sought to emulate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=374.58s)]
*  And let's be honest, too, the kind of ethno-nationalist authoritarian tendencies that Putin is kind [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=378.62s)]
*  of at the vanguard at globally is something, too, that we've seen elements of the Republican [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  Party embrace here in the United States. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=388.7s)]
*  So there's kind of a natural affinity here that has been, you know, to pardon the pun [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=390.7s)]
*  here, the elephant in the room for the Republican Party since at least 2016. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=396.86s)]
*  Well, let's talk about some more of where this is going. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=401.14s)]
*  Donald Trump and his allies talking about how tough Trump was with Putin, that Trump [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  wouldn't have dared do something like this while Trump was around. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=410.06s)]
*  Talk to me about that, because mathematically they're right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=414.38s)]
*  There wasn't an invasion by Vladimir Putin between 2014 and now, but there's been an [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=416.48s)]
*  ongoing war the whole time in which 14,000 people have died, most of which was while [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=421.8s)]
*  Donald Trump was president. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=426.92s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=427.92s)]
*  It's a completely absurd claim. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  And the reality is part of what Putin was doing was letting Trump do his work for him [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=432.06s)]
*  in terms of dismantling the post-Cold War and even Cold War security architecture of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=436.68s)]
*  NATO, of the transatlantic alliance between the United States and Europe. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump was a wrecking ball in that space, and that's exactly what Putin wants. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=446.44s)]
*  And I want to take head on this idea that you could even argue that Trump and his weakness, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  at least, was preventing the kind of escalation that we've seen from Putin. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=456.28s)]
*  I think the reality is what Putin was waiting for and probably what he would have gotten [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=460.4s)]
*  in the second Trump term is further US distancing not just from Ukraine, but from Europe and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=465.2s)]
*  NATO itself. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=471.24s)]
*  And if you listen to that speech from Vladimir Putin yesterday and if you look closely at [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=472.52s)]
*  his worldview, one way or another, he was going to subjugate Ukraine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=476.2s)]
*  One way or another, he was going to try to eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=481.28s)]
*  That's exactly what he told us yesterday. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=485.84s)]
*  That's what he believes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=487.92s)]
*  If that was going to be made easier for him because the United States was going to hang [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=489.36s)]
*  Ukraine out on a limb, then he was going to wait and see if that happened. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=493.12s)]
*  And oh, by the way, if the United States distanced itself further from NATO, and you'll recall [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump had to be dragged kicking and screaming just to restate the basic principle [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=501.36s)]
*  that the United States would come to the defense of our NATO allies. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=507.04s)]
*  With a second Trump term, what Putin could have waited for is a circumstance where the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=510.48s)]
*  United States commitment to NATO, or even the United States membership in NATO, was [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=515.12s)]
*  in question. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=518.92s)]
*  And once he'd subjugated Ukraine, his capacity to threaten or try to control or try to influence [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=520.24s)]
*  the politics of further countries in Eastern Europe or NATO member states would have been [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=525.96s)]
*  enhanced. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=530.28s)]
*  Not only is it false to say that Donald Trump was somehow strong in standing up to Putin, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  that's just crazy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=536.28s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=537.28s)]
*  Anybody who had two eyes during the Trump years knows that's not true. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=538.28s)]
*  But even to say that this kind of chummy relationship that he had with Putin was somehow going to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=541.64s)]
*  avert what we've seen, I don't think that's true either. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=547.28s)]
*  I think one way or another, Vladimir Putin was going to do what he was going to do, and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=549.64s)]
*  Trump was just going to make it easier for him if he'd had four more years. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=552.88s)]
*  Ben, thanks for your analysis. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=555.76s)]
*  As always, Ben Rhodes is the Deputy National Security Advisor under President Obama. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=557.24s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=561.72s)]
*  Today, the U.S., the UK, and all 27 EU member nations unanimously imposed sweeping restrictions [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=563.72s)]
*  against Russia, or, to use President Biden's words, carving out a big chunk of Ukraine. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=570.64s)]
*  The details of the sanctions differ between the three groups, but the broad strokes are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=576.52s)]
*  the same. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=580.16s)]
*  All of them sanctioned Russian banks, elite Russian individuals, and cut off Russia from [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=581.24s)]
*  Western financing. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=586.08s)]
*  The U.S., for example, is fully sanctioning two of Russia's biggest banks, VEB, which [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=587.6s)]
*  is one of Russia's biggest investment banks, and Russia's military bank, PSB, both of which [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  are crucial to financing Russia's defense industry. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=598.94s)]
*  The military bank alone handles 70% of Russia's defense contracts, and it's the smaller of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=601.82s)]
*  the two banks. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  The U.S. is also sanctioning a handful of elite Russian individuals and cutting off [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=608.94s)]
*  U.S. financing of Russian sovereign debt. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=613.1600000000001s)]
*  In addition to the sanctions that are being imposed by the UK and the EU, Germany delivered [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=615.58s)]
*  what might be the biggest economic blow against Russia today by halting Russia's Nord Stream [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=621.44s)]
*  2 pipeline. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=626.86s)]
*  You see two pipelines there through the Baltic Sea. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=627.86s)]
*  The one in the red is Nord Stream 1. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=630.44s)]
*  The one in blue is Nord Stream 2. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=632.88s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 is not on yet. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=634.86s)]
*  It's not online. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=636.32s)]
*  It's been built. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=637.32s)]
*  We've been unsure about whether Germany, which is in the midst of a domestic energy crisis, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=638.32s)]
*  would reject the potential flow of double the amount of natural gas from Russia. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=642.7s)]
*  But today, Germany did just that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=647.44s)]
*  The West presented a united front. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=650.96s)]
*  All groups involved were also very clear. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=653.1s)]
*  This is just the first round of sanctions, and that significantly worse punishments are [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=655.0400000000001s)]
*  ready if Russia continues to advance. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=659.24s)]
*  But what exactly would those harsher sanctions be? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=661.58s)]
*  Would they target Putin personally? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=665.1600000000001s)]
*  How quickly could they get Russia to the negotiating table, given that sanctions typically have [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=667.72s)]
*  more of a long term impact? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=671.6s)]
*  And what type of economic impact could all of this have on us here in the United States? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=673.84s)]
*  Joining me is someone who knows a great deal about sanctions. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=680.48s)]
*  Hagar Shamali is a senior policy advisor in the Treasury Sanctions Division during the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=682.84s)]
*  Obama administration. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=687.08s)]
*  She was a Treasury spokesperson back when the United States imposed sanctions on Russia [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=688.08s)]
*  in 2014 for its annexation of Crimea. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=692.48s)]
*  She's also the host of Oh My World on YouTube. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=695.24s)]
*  Hagar, thanks again for being with us. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  You and I have talked, I think, every single day for the last few days. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=699.14s)]
*  Let me ask you about the seriousness of these sanctions. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=702.9s)]
*  Why I say this is because I think back to when you were involved with Iran. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=706.26s)]
*  And for years, Iran had been dawdling with everybody and not really getting down to business. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=710.62s)]
*  And then the US Treasury imposed certain types of sanctions that were so effective that it [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=714.86s)]
*  got to the table and it ended up resulting ultimately in the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=720.18s)]
*  What's that magic bullet for Russia? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=724.5s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned Iran because I was thinking about it during your introduction. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  And people always say that sanctions don't work until they do. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=731.92s)]
*  And Iran is a perfect example of that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=735.48s)]
*  Those sanctions, the ones that really crippled Iran's economy, that brought them to the negotiating [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=737.52s)]
*  table were sanctions related to its oil sector, the ones that prevented other countries from [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=741.6s)]
*  purchasing the oil and from Iran from benefiting from those proceeds. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=747.56s)]
*  And that's also for Russia. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=752.24s)]
*  The oil and gas sector is a major hit. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=754.04s)]
*  You mentioned it in your introduction. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=755.96s)]
*  The sanctions related to Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Germany did and we needed Germany to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=757.54s)]
*  do that and to lead on that, that robs Russia of billions, billions with a B, billions of [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=762.9s)]
*  dollars. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=768.86s)]
*  And that money will go to fuel its violence machine, right, and to prop up Putin's regime. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=769.86s)]
*  So those are going to be strong. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=775.34s)]
*  And the sanctions that you saw from the Biden administration, the bottom line is that all [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=776.98s)]
*  of those sanctions are very tough. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=780.86s)]
*  They will inflict financial pain on Russia, but they may not be enough to walk him back [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=782.7s)]
*  from what he's just done. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=788.0s)]
*  So what is that? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=789.5s)]
*  How does one find the may not be enough? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=790.5s)]
*  What's the thing in Iran? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  You talked about the oil sanctions. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=794.84s)]
*  There was the removal of Iran from the swift system. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  So the people just couldn't do any trade with anyone. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=799.1600000000001s)]
*  You couldn't sell carpets. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=801.36s)]
*  You couldn't sell anything to anyone that required a different currency or an international [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=802.36s)]
*  bank. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=806.24s)]
*  What's the equivalent for Russia that would really hurt? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=807.24s)]
*  I assume it's oil and gas stuff because it's the biggest thing they sell. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=810.64s)]
*  Oil and gas would be huge, but it also gives them that's also a point of leverage for them, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=814.06s)]
*  right? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=819.54s)]
*  So because Russia so integrated into the international financial system, they do make them a target [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=820.54s)]
*  that is easy to hit with sanctions. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=826.34s)]
*  But at the same time, they could retaliate and there will be backlash on US and European [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=828.22s)]
*  business and also global markets, right? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=833.02s)]
*  So if they rob the Europeans of the gas that they export to Europe, which currently Europe [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=836.2s)]
*  imports 40% of its gas and oil from Russia, then that would cause a price skyrocketing [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=841.0s)]
*  all over the place, right? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  Because Europe would have to find a new source, would have to fix its refinery production [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=848.82s)]
*  abilities and it would be here too. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=853.38s)]
*  It would affect our prices here because oil and gas go up globally. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=855.26s)]
*  Yes, it would absolutely affect us here. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=858.1s)]
*  Now that said, that doesn't mean that there aren't a number of other options that the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=861.1s)]
*  White House and the Treasury Department and state could pursue to further tighten the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=865.44s)]
*  financial noose around Russia. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=869.28s)]
*  You have, for example, more Russian financial institutions. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=871.2s)]
*  We haven't yet seen any export controls placed on the export and sale of US technology to [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=874.32s)]
*  Russia that supports its oil and gas sector, its efforts to diversify its economy, its [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=880.0400000000001s)]
*  efforts to develop technology and its mobile sector and so on, right? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=885.6s)]
*  That would hit them hard. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  Of course, you have Russian oligarchs. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=890.7399999999999s)]
*  Europe for years has allowed those Russian oligarchs to park their assets there, to invest [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=892.8199999999999s)]
*  in real estate and set up their businesses there. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=898.18s)]
*  So there's a lot of opportunity there. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=901.16s)]
*  What the EU did today was also impressive given that EU sanctions require the consensus [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=903.6199999999999s)]
*  of all members and that includes Hungary and Hungary is close to Russia, right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=908.5s)]
*  So that's a strong message. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=912.6199999999999s)]
*  You still have major moves like cutting off Swift relationship. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=914.72s)]
*  You have things like sanctioning President Putin himself. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=920.48s)]
*  Things like that are never off the table, right? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=923.12s)]
*  So you can ramp it up. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=925.0s)]
*  And the one thing I would I would end here with is that Secretary Janet Yellen said in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  the press release something I thought that was very key. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=931.72s)]
*  She said that this was the beginning of dismantling the Kremlin's financial network, meaning [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=934.12s)]
*  they have a lot left in the hopper and they want at least President Putin to stop in his [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=940.9s)]
*  tracks and then, you know, and then there are more to hopefully make him walk backwards [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=945.5s)]
*  with a strategy, you know, another strategy, a broader strategy in place as well. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=950.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=956.06s)]
*  Well, look, every day these new things come out and people like us don't know exactly [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=957.06s)]
*  what to make of them. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=960.9799999999999s)]
*  But that's when we call you and we say, is this is this a big one? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=961.9799999999999s)]
*  Is this serious? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=964.0999999999999s)]
*  So we'll be doing that over the course of the next few days with you. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=965.0999999999999s)]
*  Thanks, my friend. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=967.18s)]
*  I'm Mark Schimali, former senior policy adviser in the Treasury Sanctions Division. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=971.8s)]
*  That was, of course, the World Cup crowd chanting equal pay after the U.S. women's national [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=982.2399999999999s)]
*  soccer team scored their fourth world title in France. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=987.04s)]
*  Now, if you've been a fan of this show, you know that TRMS has been covering the team's [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=990.28s)]
*  long six year fight for equal pay for several years now. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=994.52s)]
*  But that fight reached a tipping point on International Women's Day in twenty nineteen [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBTffiCezo&t=999.1s)]
