# New Texas GOP Voting Rules Tie Election System In Knots; Thousands Of Ballots Rejected
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I)
*  It was 144 years ago that members of the Democratic Party first met in convention to select a presidential candidate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=0.0s)]
*  Since that time, Democrats have continued to convene once every four years and draft a party platform and nominate a presidential candidate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=17.0s)]
*  And our meeting this week is a continuation of that tradition. But there is something different about tonight. There is something special about tonight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=28.0s)]
*  What is different? What is special? I, Barbara Jordan, am a keynote speaker. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=40.0s)]
*  Yes, she was. More than four decades ago, Barbara Jordan took the stage at the Democratic National Convention and made history as the first black woman to deliver the keynote address. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=47.0s)]
*  That moment was a first among many in her political career. Just a decade before that speech, she became the first black person since Reconstruction to win a seat in the Texas State Senate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=62.0s)]
*  It was during her time there as President pro tempore that she also served as the first black female governor for a day when the governor and lieutenant governor were both out of the state on government business. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=73.0s)]
*  Jordan would go on to serve as the first black woman to represent Texas in Congress, serving three terms in the House. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=86.0s)]
*  But her illustrious career started in a very unassuming way, registering people to vote. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=93.0s)]
*  In 1960, while volunteering on JFK's presidential campaign, Jordan managed a get out the vote program in Houston. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=99.0s)]
*  And it is that part of Jordan's legacy that's inspiring another young woman from Texas in her push to expand voting access across the state. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=107.0s)]
*  Taylor Coleman is a Democratic strategist who decided to live out of her van, a van named Barb after Barbara Jordan, as she drives all over the Lone Star State trying to register as many voters as possible. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=115.0s)]
*  Her effort could not come at a more critical time. In just over a week, Texans go to the polls to vote in the first primaries this election year. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=127.0s)]
*  But a new restrictive law has already forced officials across the state to reject ballots. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=137.0s)]
*  In Harris County, the largest county in Texas by population, the county elections office tells us that as of yesterday, they have tossed out 4,453 mail-in ballots, citing issues with ID requirements. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=143.0s)]
*  That is about 34% of all the ballots they have received in the mail as of yesterday. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=157.0s)]
*  And that's in addition to the more than 4,700 mail-in ballot applications that were rejected because they also did not meet these ID requirements. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=164.0s)]
*  That's about 14% of all the mail-in ballot applications received in the county. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=174.0s)]
*  Now Harris County wants the federal Justice Department to investigate, asking the department in a letter to quote, exhaust every legal option available to ensure that each eligible voter in Harris County and the state of Texas has their vote counted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=179.0s)]
*  Texas's new election law is so extreme that voting rights groups are also worried it could criminalize the act of helping a disabled voter at the polls, given that the new legislation adds restrictions to those people assisting voters. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=193.0s)]
*  It is obstacles like these that give Taylor Coleman's work purpose and urgency. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=207.0s)]
*  She recently told the Houston Chronicle quote, what we're going through right now reflects some very tense moments in our country's past. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=213.0s)]
*  And voting rights for me is how I knew I would be able to make sure that people who look like me would continue to have a say. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=220.0s)]
*  Ms. Coleman, thank you so much for taking time for us this evening. Are you in the Barb van? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=227.0s)]
*  I am in the van. Thank you so, so much for having me. That explains my poor connection today. But I'm so glad to be here with you guys. Thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=232.0s)]
*  We're so glad you're there, Taylor. We are hearing these reports about ballots being tossed, the application process being fraught at best, and concerns about access to the polls for people who are helping disabled voters. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=245.0s)]
*  All of this a result of SB1, Texas's new voting law. What have you been hearing from voters as you're going around the country trying to navigate these restrictions and get people registered to vote? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=258.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Alex, I mean, I've seen exactly what has been portrayed in the news reports that you cited. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=273.0s)]
*  You know, just today, I was on the road actually with the caravan with Black Voters Matter. And when I was at the county elections office, just as I was in line waiting to get certified here in Texas, you actually have to be legally certified in a county to register voters there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=280.0s)]
*  Just as I was waiting in line, there were two people turned away trying to help register their elderly grandparents or parents to be able to vote by mail. Today is the last day to do that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=300.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, they were turned away because, you know, their elderly parent or grandparent was not with them. So they couldn't show their ID. So they, you know, were turned away. They were not able to get those vote by mail applications. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=315.0s)]
*  And, you know, I overheard one of the gentlemen there, you know, saying, you know, his mother is 95 years old. You know, she's not going to be able to make it to the polls. And so in order to, you know, vote by mail, you have to show your ID. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=329.0s)]
*  All of these hurdles have very, very real impacts on Texans. And so I'm just, I'm glad I'm able to shed some sort of a light on what's going on down here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=344.0s)]
*  Taylor, what are people saying? Are they angry? Are they frustrated? Are they more focused than ever on trying to get these ballots cast? What's the mood? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=355.0s)]
*  I think people are very frustrated. Not only are voters frustrated, you have people who have voted by mail for, you know, decades. You know, a voter that is, you know, well into her 90s has been eligible to vote by mail for, you know, over, you know, nearly 30 years. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=366.0s)]
*  And to have these laws change, you know, right before a new election is very frustrating to voters. And I'll say not just frustrating to voters, but also to the county elections officials who have to enforce some of these rules. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=385.0s)]
*  You know, I think you mentioned at the top of the show how, you know, the different lawsuits and things that are being brought to try to fight back against some of these restrictions. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=400.0s)]
*  I know that there was a specific county elections official who really, you know, her argument was that this is a First Amendment issue. It is a state jail felony, actually, for a nonpartisan election official to be considered soliciting mail and vote by mail applications. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=411.0s)]
*  So these rules are not only frustrating to voters who, you know, maybe weren't as tuned in to what's happening, but, you know, as it starts to impact them, they're confused by the changes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=432.0s)]
*  It's definitely an extra burden for the nonpartisan election officials who are just trying to do their jobs without risking jail time. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=444.0s)]
*  Taylor, I just have one quick question. I mean, given the thicket of red tape here, I believe in Texas you have to become a deputy registrar in the country and in the county where you want to register voters. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=454.0s)]
*  And they're like 254 counties in Texas. How have you managed to pull this off? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=464.0s)]
*  I'll say it has not been easy. Just today, you know, people have asked, you know, what's your itinerary? What's your plan? It's actually very hard to plan, you know, when the goal is, you know, hitting all of these counties to register voters. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=471.0s)]
*  Just today, again, on this tour, you know, as Black Voters of Matter has been registering students at colleges across the state, there were several students and also people in the community who wanted to register to vote today. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=486.0s)]
*  I was only certified in one of the counties and they came from, you know, neighboring counties. And Texas is a big state, but, you know, these are counties 15 minutes away. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=502.0s)]
*  And not only am I not certified in some of those counties yet, but even the voter registration applications, you have to have them for the specific county where the voter lives. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=512.0s)]
*  So all of these rules seem so benign on paper. But when 254 counties, again, these election workers, sometimes they're just a one man show. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=525.0s)]
*  You know, I had one county election worker. I mean, she was in tears, you know, when I showed up to try to get certified because in the midst of everything else that she has to do to prepare for an election, she has to drop everything to fill out some paperwork so that a fellow Texan can help register other Americans to vote in her county. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=536.0s)]
*  And it's it's it is unnecessarily prohibitive. You know, all of this could be solved with online voter registration, which we know is safe and secure. And Texas has chosen not to do that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=557.0s)]
*  . [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI71CVOf9_I&t=587.0s)]
