# Trump coziness with Putin seen in U.S. backing off countering Russian sabotage in Europe: Report
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw)
*  Western intelligence agencies believe Russia is behind two recent attempts to smuggle explosives [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=0.0s)]
*  onto cargo planes and may be targeting planes bound for the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=6.96s)]
*  Tom Costello is with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=11.36s)]
*  Tom, this is quite concerning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=12.84s)]
*  What have you learned? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=14.56s)]
*  It really is. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=15.56s)]
*  The explosives went off in DHL cargo hubs in Germany and Britain. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=16.56s)]
*  Had a bomb exploded while the plane was in the air, the head of German domestic intelligence [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=21.04s)]
*  says the plane would likely have crashed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=25.38s)]
*  A Western security official tells NBC News it could be a Russian operation to undermine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=27.8s)]
*  support for Ukraine and cargo flights to the U.S. and Canada could be targeted. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=32.96s)]
*  Last summer, explosions at DHL cargo hubs. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=40.64s)]
*  They were not accidents. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=44.64s)]
*  They were not isolated incidents. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=45.64s)]
*  They were part of what European and American officials described as an expanding campaign [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=47.1s)]
*  of Russian sabotage, including arson in the U.K. and the Czech Republic, attacks on pipelines [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=52.32s)]
*  and data cables in the Baltic, and tampering with water supplies in Sweden and Finland. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=58.4s)]
*  Earlier last year, the U.S. also helped Germany interrupt an alleged plot, an alleged Russian [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=64.36s)]
*  plot to assassinate an executive at a German arms manufacturer, a German arms manufacturer [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=69.08s)]
*  that supplies arms to the Ukrainian military. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=76.16s)]
*  Those cargo bombs on those DHL planes, even with all that other stuff, when the DHL planes [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=80.88s)]
*  started having bombs on board, U.S. intelligence officials said they were a Russian test run [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=86.24s)]
*  to figure out how those devices could get aboard planes bound for the U.S. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=91.84s)]
*  And as such, that was a frightening new escalation for American officials, the idea that that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=97.84s)]
*  sabotage campaign could be coming here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=102.96s)]
*  Months later, the New York Times reported that White House officials became, quote, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  increasingly alarmed by secretly obtained intelligence suggesting Moscow had a far larger [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  plan in mind to bring the war in Ukraine to American shores. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=116.08s)]
*  President Biden dispatched his national security adviser and the CIA director to send a series [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  of warnings to Putin's top aides. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=126.1s)]
*  The core of the warning was that if the sabotage campaign led by Russia created mass casualties [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=128.7s)]
*  in the air or on the ground, the U.S. would hold Russia responsible. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=135.0s)]
*  They didn't specify what that response would be, but they made it clear they would take [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=139.0s)]
*  the shadow war between Washington and Moscow to new levels. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=142.44s)]
*  So that was last year. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=148.6s)]
*  A new in-depth study of Russia's sabotage campaign finds that the number of Russian [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=151.16s)]
*  sabotage attacks in Europe nearly tripled between 2023 and last year after quadrupling [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=156.28s)]
*  the year before that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=163.92s)]
*  Reporting on that, here's how the New York Times put it, quote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  Anger at Russia's sabotage efforts has the potential to influence European reactions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=168.32s)]
*  to the U.S.-led push for an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=172.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland noted in a social media post on Monday that Lithuanian [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=175.32s)]
*  officials had confirmed his assessment that Russia was responsible for a series of fires [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=180.04s)]
*  in shopping centers in Warsaw and Vilnius. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Tusk wrote, quote, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=188.44s)]
*  Good to know before negotiations. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=189.56s)]
*  Such is the nature of this state. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=192.0s)]
*  A message to countries supporting Ukraine has been that Russia can impose costs and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=195.0s)]
*  increase them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=199.6s)]
*  So we had this very big scare last year with not just this sabotage campaign rapidly escalating [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=203.16s)]
*  in Europe, but it appearing to start to target the United States. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=210.32s)]
*  Yesterday, we get data that Russian sabotage attacks in Europe quadrupled one year and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=215.28s)]
*  then tripled the year after that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=220.0s)]
*  Well, now today we get this from Reuters. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=222.72s)]
*  U.S. suspends some efforts to counter Russian sabotage as Trump moves closer to Putin. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=225.16s)]
*  Quote, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=232.04s)]
*  Several U.S. national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=233.04s)]
*  Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyber attacks, easing pressure on Moscow as the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump administration pushes Russia to end its war in Ukraine. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=242.04s)]
*  The effort involved at least seven national security agencies working with European allies [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=245.6s)]
*  to disrupt plots targeting Europe and the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=250.16s)]
*  Since Trump took office, much of the work has come to a standstill. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  Reuters cites 11 current and former officials here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=258.64s)]
*  I'll tell you what Reuters that Reuters did ask the Kremlin what they think about this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=261.24s)]
*  reporting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=265.76s)]
*  Quote, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=266.76s)]
*  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Trump administration was trying to get rid of everything [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=267.76s)]
*  ineffective, corrupt and implausible. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=271.96s)]
*  Something he said was, quote, understandable. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=276.0s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the reporters on that story, Reuters national security correspondent [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=280.28s)]
*  Erin Banko. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=283.52s)]
*  Miss Banko, thanks very much for being here and forgetting this scoop. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=284.52s)]
*  I appreciate the chance to talk with you about it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  Is the United States pulling back from anti-Russian sabotage efforts because they don't believe [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=291.76s)]
*  they're happening or because they believe that the efforts are ineffective? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=299.0s)]
*  What's the rationale on the U.S. side for cutting back on these efforts? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=304.28s)]
*  I would say it's very clear from officials we've spoken to both in this administration [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=309.44s)]
*  and in the prior administration that our intelligence, U.S. intelligence, European intelligence, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  still shows that Russia poses a threat both to the U.S. and to Europe in regard to its [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=320.96s)]
*  hybrid warfare campaign or its sabotage campaign. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=328.08s)]
*  That threat has not gone away. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=331.0s)]
*  We've spoken to several very senior intelligence officials about this fact. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=332.64s)]
*  This intelligence has been circulated as recently as last week here in the U.S. and in Europe. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  But it's very clear from the conversations we've had over the last month or two that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=344.56s)]
*  this administration does not view the countering of Russia's hybrid warfare campaign as a priority. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=349.08s)]
*  This was a very high priority for the prior administration. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=357.6s)]
*  A program they stood up in 2024 to across the interagency track, combat this campaign [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=362.52s)]
*  both in Europe and potentially in the U.S. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=370.96s)]
*  A huge part of that was coordinating with Europe. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=373.72s)]
*  That included everything from sharing intelligence to drawing up strategies for trying to counter [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=376.48s)]
*  Russia's campaign. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=385.12s)]
*  So it was a massive priority for the Biden administration and something Biden officials [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=387.36s)]
*  briefed Trump officials on right before they left, urging them to continue this program. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=392.44s)]
*  The sabotage that Russia has been accused of, their efforts, mostly have been documented [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=400.24s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=405.72s)]
*  There is this very worrying case on the record in terms of them targeting parcel bombs that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=406.72s)]
*  were on planes, potentially to be bound for the United States. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=411.0s)]
*  What do you understand about the balance of, I guess, the balance of how much heavy lifting [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=415.56s)]
*  was being done in this effort by European nations versus by the U.S.? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=422.08s)]
*  Presumably the Europeans are going to still be trying to counter this stuff because they've [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=426.68s)]
*  been bearing more of the brunt of it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=430.56s)]
*  With the U.S. withdrawing, how much harder is their work going to be? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=432.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good question. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=436.4s)]
*  Local law enforcement in many of these countries are leading the way in terms of investigations [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=439.32s)]
*  looking at some of these sabotage acts. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=444.84s)]
*  But I should note it's not just sabotage acts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=449.08s)]
*  It's not just arson and tax we're talking about here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=451.28s)]
*  We're talking about everything from arson to influence campaigns and political elections [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  to cyber intrusions. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=459.64s)]
*  And a huge part of what the U.S. did under Biden was shared critical intelligence on [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=462.4s)]
*  unfolding sabotage plots but on what was going on in the cyberspace as well. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=468.96s)]
*  And so what happens when the U.S. pulls back or deprioritizes something like this is that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=475.2s)]
*  the coordination in terms of intelligence sharing then gets lost. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  I should note that there's no evidence that sort of the systematic intelligence that gets [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  shared from the U.S. and Europe has ceased. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=491.56s)]
*  But there was this coordinated effort by the White House in particular, the National [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=494.84s)]
*  Security Council, the FBI, DHS, where a lot of those conversations were happening that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  is no longer. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=505.32s)]
*  And so when the U.S. pulls back from something like that, you lose a lot of not only the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=507.64s)]
*  coordination but the intelligence as well. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=511.12s)]
*  Reuters National Security correspondent Erin Banko, thank you very much for this time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=515.48s)]
*  I know this is very difficult reporting in this sector of government operations. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  It's really valuable. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=522.92s)]
*  Thank you for helping us understand it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3t85EtoNWw&t=524.0s)]
