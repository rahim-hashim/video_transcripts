Video Description: Rachel Maddow contrasts the list of actions Republicans in state governments are already taking to restrict voting access with remarks by Joe Manchin that he is standing with Republican obstruction of voting rights legislation because "government" will stand with voters, even though Manchin does not apparently recognize his own position in government as playing a role in that defense.

# As State Republicans Pare Back Voting Access, Manchin Blurts Obtuse Excuses
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I)
*  So, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has just submitted a proposed new map for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=0.0s)]
*  congressional districts in his state. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=7.36s)]
*  What he proposes is that Florida should cut in half the number of congressional districts [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=9.68s)]
*  that are majority black. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=14.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=17.52s)]
*  Texas' largest counties are now starting to report on the real-world impact of the voting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=20.06s)]
*  restrictions that Texas Republicans passed this past year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=24.62s)]
*  As many as half the ballot requests they're getting from voters in the state's largest [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=28.24s)]
*  counties are now being rejected by the state because the new voting rights restrictions [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  they just passed requires that those ballot requests be rejected. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=37.4s)]
*  Half the ballot requests being turned away. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=42.56s)]
*  In Wisconsin, where Republican legislators have been moving aggressively to restrict [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  all sorts of voting methods, a state court judge just sided with them and ruled that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=49.84s)]
*  Wisconsin can, in fact, remove its drop boxes that people use to drop off their ballots [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  for the election. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=61.0s)]
*  Wisconsin's next election is less than a month from now, so they are rushing to rip out the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=63.04s)]
*  drop boxes and give people fewer places to vote with less than a month to go. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=67.72s)]
*  Gotta hurry. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=72.24s)]
*  People found it very safe, very secure, very convenient to vote that way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=73.24s)]
*  As recently as the last election, the next one's coming out quick. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  That must be stopped. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=79.28s)]
*  Today in Washington, D.C., conservative Democratic Senator Joe Manchin appeared before reporters, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=83.64s)]
*  I'll tell you, he was wearing kind of a gym suit, it was like a tunic of some kind, I'm [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=88.28s)]
*  only saying that just so you're not jarred by his appearance in this next clip. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=92.8s)]
*  He was at the U.S. Capitol, but he was wearing this sporty outfit, I don't know. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=96.4s)]
*  Anyway, he told reporters sort of scornfully while he was answering their questions that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=101.28s)]
*  he and Senator Kyrsten Sinema working with Republicans to block federal voting rights [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=105.6s)]
*  protections that will in no way result in people not being able to vote in the next election. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=111.0s)]
*  He said that won't happen in the next election because the government won't allow it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=116.44s)]
*  I know you don't know what that could possibly mean. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=124.0s)]
*  I know you think I'm paraphrasing him in a way that is obscuring what he must have meant, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  but honestly, that's what we've got. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=131.16s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=134.2s)]
*  Senator Manchin, what would you say to voters of color who say that your inability or your obstruction of the voting rights? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=136.2s)]
*  I'm not, there's no obstruction whatsoever. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=142.2s)]
*  But there are a lot of people out there who are saying that you're making it so that they're not going to be able to vote in the next election. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=144.2s)]
*  The law's there, the rules are there, basically the government. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=149.2s)]
*  The government will stand behind them and make sure they have a right to vote. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=152.2s)]
*  We have that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=155.2s)]
*  The government will stand in the way. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=159.2s)]
*  The government will do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=163.2s)]
*  That's the exact phrase he used there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=165.2s)]
*  The law's there, the rules are there, basically the government. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=167.2s)]
*  The government will stand behind them so they have the right to vote. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=170.2s)]
*  We have that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=173.2s)]
*  Who's the government in this construction? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=176.2s)]
*  Senator Joe Manchin actually has it in his personal hands whether or not the government will stand behind people to protect their right to vote. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=180.2s)]
*  Right now, thanks to him, it is the government in places like Florida, places like Texas, places like Wisconsin, places like Georgia. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=189.2s)]
*  It is the government in those places, the state government controlled by Republicans, that in fact is making it so people can't vote or can't have their votes counted. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=197.2s)]
*  Or have their vote diluted to such an extent that their votes basically don't count no matter how potently and completely they and their cohort votes for their chosen representative. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=205.2s)]
*  The existing Federal Voting Rights Act was gutted by the United States Supreme Court by Republican-appointed judges. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=220.2s)]
*  The restrictions on voting rights we're now seeing, like this one in Texas, they can't be blocked anymore by the federal government. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=226.2s)]
*  Right, this new law in Texas that's having the state required by law to throw out half the ballot applications, it's law. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=235.2s)]
*  It is new law they made in Texas, it is in effect, it's not being blocked by anything. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=245.2s)]
*  The state government has radically rescinded voting rights there and no one's coming to the rescue because of Joe Manchin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=250.2s)]
*  I mean the federal government can only help in those instances if Congress acts, if Congress passes legislation to let the federal government step in and establish federal minimum standards in terms of voting rights and the election and the administration of elections. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=258.2s)]
*  It's Joe Manchin and Kirsten Sinema in the United States Senate who are working with Republican senators to stop that from happening. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=273.2s)]
*  But Senator Manchin says, you know, don't worry, he sure, as is all overblown, the government will fix it somehow. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=281.2s)]
*  As if it's not the government that is blocking people from voting, the Republican-led state government that is blocking people from voting in these states. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=290.2s)]
*  And as if he's not the government. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=299.2s)]
*  As if he's not the reason that the federal government can't step in to fix this stuff. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=304.2s)]
*  The federal government could step in and fix this stuff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=309.2s)]
*  It is those two senators working with Republicans that are blocking that from happening. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=312.2s)]
*  In the great state of Georgia today where the Republican leadership in that state has also this past year radically restricted the voting rights of Georgia residents. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=317.2s)]
*  Republicans have just moved another one of their own officials into position so they can use the new powers they just gave themselves to get rid of the elections boards in mostly Democratic counties and instead have all Republican officials oversee the vote in those Democratic areas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=325.2s)]
*  Today's move by Georgia Republicans was their next major step toward taking over Fulton County, Georgia, where more Democratic votes are cast in that state than in any other county. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=340.2s)]
*  Republicans are kicking out the local elections officials and taking it over for themselves. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=349.2s)]
*  Why do you think they'd want to do that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=355.2s)]
*  But don't worry, Senator Joe Manchin said, surely the government will help in a case like this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=359.2s)]
*  Surely the government won't let this happen. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=364.2s)]
*  This is the government. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=367.2s)]
*  This is the Republican-led state government of Georgia moving radically to rescind voting rights. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=369.2s)]
*  We do not have federal standards to block this kind of thing because of Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Kirsten Sinema working with Republican senators to make sure nothing gets in the way of whatever the Republican leadership is doing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=374.2s)]
*  This is what the Republican-led states want to do. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=385.2s)]
*  Today was just, you know, scene after scene, seams from a country that is trying to save itself. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=390.2s)]
*  You [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqv0xUNvt6I&t=415.2s)]
