# As Biden steps aside and Harris ascends, what happens next?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA)
*  Mike, let me ask you about a couple of things that now seem like legitimately open questions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously, the president settled so much of what has been uncertain in Democratic politics [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=7.68s)]
*  and in American politics with this dramatic decision today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=13.66s)]
*  But there are open questions now, one more technocratic and one quite substantive in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=16.7s)]
*  terms of the politics of it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  The technocratic question is, if, as you put it, President Biden is hoping that the party [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=22.98s)]
*  will unite now behind the candidate he has endorsed, behind his vice president, Kamala [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=29.98s)]
*  Harris, is there clarity about what needs to happen technically in terms of the delegates, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=33.84s)]
*  in terms of ballot access, in terms of fundraising? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=40.86s)]
*  We've seen a filing with the FEC already noting that Kamala Harris is now at the top of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  ticket for what previously had been their joint ticket. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=50.38s)]
*  Is there clarity within the White House as to how technically this is going to happen? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=54.62s)]
*  And the other question, real, very much an open question, is who Kamala Harris will choose [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  as her running mate? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Is that discussion open and engaged at the White House at this point? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=70.62s)]
*  Well, I'll start with that first question because this is so interesting to me, Rachel, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=74.74s)]
*  inadvertently, some Republicans in the state of Ohio who were trying to, in the view of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=81.66s)]
*  the Biden team and the Democratic National Committee, play games with election access [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=86.58s)]
*  by potentially depriving Biden from being put on the ballot in the state of Ohio because [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=92.86s)]
*  the convention for the DNC was after Ohio's filing deadline. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  That kicked into gear, a process by which we would have this virtual nomination decided [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=102.74s)]
*  well in advance of the Ohio deadline to end that uncertainty. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=108.34s)]
*  And as I understand it, the conversations in the last few days have also focused on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=111.58s)]
*  what this process would look like to move forward with that plan, to have a virtual [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  nomination choose the nominee. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=121.62s)]
*  The biggest uncertainty, though, during these conversations was would any other Democrat [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=124.18s)]
*  raise their hand and choose to run if President Biden were to step aside, but even if he were [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=128.38s)]
*  to stay in this race? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=134.34s)]
*  And that is where we still have some uncertainty about what there might be in terms of a mini [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=136.42s)]
*  primary, what Vice President Harris might have to do to show if there are other candidates [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=142.02s)]
*  in this race how she can put herself to the top of the line in the view of those delegates [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=146.94s)]
*  to the convention to earn their support. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=151.34s)]
*  And that's why there was a lot made of Barack Obama, former president's statement today, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=153.82s)]
*  where he was effusive in praising his former running mate for making this very difficult [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=158.66s)]
*  decision. But absent from that statement was any discussion of supporting Vice President [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=164.14s)]
*  Harris in this process. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=169.42s)]
*  That was very deliberate, as I'm told from sources familiar with his thinking, because [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  just as in 2020, when he was supportive in certain ways, but not explicitly endorsing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=174.38s)]
*  Joe Biden as a candidate in 2020, he wanted to be in position once the nomination was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=180.18s)]
*  decided to rally the rest of the party fully behind the nominee, whomever that ended up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=184.9s)]
*  being. He wants to ensure that he can do just that right now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=189.1s)]
*  So the DNC is still working through this. The chairman of the DNC putting out a statement [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  saying that they will have more to say in the coming days about that process. But I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=196.98s)]
*  think the biggest question that will dictate the process moving forward is will anybody [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=200.98s)]
*  raise their hand to do that now as it relates to the running mate decision? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  This is something I've been hearing about for weeks already. In fact, one of the first [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=209.22s)]
*  names that was raised to me is somebody who we just received a statement from was the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=213.5s)]
*  governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, who is endorsing Vice President Harris to be the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=218.22s)]
*  Democratic nominee. He is somebody who has been mentioned to me for several reasons. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=222.58s)]
*  One, he is a sitting and finishing his second term as the governor of North Carolina, an [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=227.3s)]
*  important battleground state. He is somebody who served for 16 years as the attorney general [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  of North Carolina, including six years when he served at the same time as the former [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=237.3s)]
*  California attorney general, Kamala Harris. They have a relationship. He was just with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  her, in fact, as she campaigned there two days ago. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=245.94s)]
*  That is one that is at the top of the list for many I've been speaking to. Another name [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=249.38s)]
*  that has been mentioned is Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, somebody who is new to the Senate, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=253.9s)]
*  somebody who is a veteran and somebody who could bring a lot of dynamism potentially [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=259.94s)]
*  to this ticket as well. When I've been speaking to people close to Vice President Harris over [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=263.38s)]
*  the course of the last week, they have been erring on the side of total loyalty to President [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=268.46s)]
*  Biden. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=274.18s)]
*  As I asked one official, are you making preparations to have to step in here, including vetting [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=275.18s)]
*  a potential running mate? And they said they didn't want any daylight to be seen between [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=280.66s)]
*  her continued support for President Biden staying in this race and signals that might [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=284.58s)]
*  be perceived as disloyalty by doing just those things. So now there have been some people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  close to her who, on her behalf, were undergoing a process of potentially putting a campaign [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  or the makings of some staff to support her together. But now she will be fully now engaged [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  in the conversation moving forward about who a running mate would be. There's going to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=306.62s)]
*  be certainly a lot more names than the two that I just mentioned that are brought about [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=311.1s)]
*  to this conversation. There are plenty of governors and senators who would like to be [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=314.94000000000005s)]
*  part of that conversation, especially. But this is now a moment when Vice President Harris [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=318.94000000000005s)]
*  is deferring to President Biden, wants to let him have his moment before she begins [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=324.62s)]
*  making her own case for her candidacy moving forward. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=328.66s)]
*  NBC News White House correspondent Mike Memeli, near President Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=332.22s)]
*  Delaware. Historic day. It's good to have you with us, Mike. Let us know if you get [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=337.3s)]
*  anything new that we need to get on the air during the special coverage. I appreciate [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  it. Let me underscore what Mike just said there about that new news from Governor Roy [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=344.1s)]
*  Cooper of North Carolina. He is one of the people who has frequently been described as [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=349.74s)]
*  a potential running mate for Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for the Democrats. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=353.94000000000005s)]
*  He has now explicitly endorsed Kamala Harris's candidacy for president. Another governor [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=359.34s)]
*  in an important state, Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, out earlier [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  this evening with a ringing endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=371.38s)]
*  So we're starting to see the kind of consolidation in the Democratic Party that I think you would [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=375.73999999999995s)]
*  expect after this unequivocal endorsement from from President Biden, including from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=380.7s)]
*  men who may be may be candidates, may be on the shortlist as a potential vice presidential [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=386.82s)]
*  running mate. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkPi4ogyHfA&t=390.78s)]
