# Anger And Fear Among Ukrainians In Russia's Crosshairs
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s)
*  Joining us now live from the port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine is NBC's chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel. Richard, great reporting. Thank you for being with us. I know it is very early over there. You are about 30 miles from the Russian border and even closer to Kremlin-backed separatists. What can you tell us about the mood on the ground? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=0.0s)]
*  So the mood here, where I am, is quite specific and unique. I'll get to that in a second. But I think the mood across Ukraine is one of despair. People are afraid. People are angry at what they feel is Russia's inability to let go. You went through some of the history and I think it's really important. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=19.0s)]
*  This country has been an independent country from the Soviet Union, from Russia's sphere of influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. And it has changed profoundly in the last three decades. Culturally, they've embraced their Ukrainian language much more, which was highly restricted. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=45.0s)]
*  And politically, they've changed. And particularly in the last eight years, they've really been racing toward democracy. And they began with a bang out of the starting gate in Maidan, in the Maidan Revolution in 2014, when Joe Biden was vice president. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=62.0s)]
*  And they have been changing their political orientation more toward Europe, more toward NATO over the last eight years. And now it feels that Putin is saying, not so fast. You don't get to go away. You don't get to deny that previous history. You come right back into the fold. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=80.0s)]
*  So there is this feeling that Russia won't let them out of this relationship and move on. Now, here where I am, very specifically, there is somewhat of a different sentiment. I am very far east. I am close to the Russian border, close to the separatist areas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=100.0s)]
*  And here, this was traditionally an area where they speak Russian indigenously. Many people are tied to Russia. Russia actually, in some of the population shifts that were so common under the Soviet Union, sent native Russians here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=118.0s)]
*  So in the end result, we have a population that's probably 25% actively, this is according to people I've spoken to, actively pro-Russian and might even welcome or support a military intervention. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=133.0s)]
*  20-so percent who would actively fight against it, pro-Kiev government and would take to the streets to defend the city. And maybe 60% in the middle that would take whatever comes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=147.0s)]
*  And that's a dangerous dynamic because it means it's win or take all. If one of those two powerful activist factions emerges on top, they get the population with them. And that is the dynamic that Putin is hoping that he'll encounter, at least in the eastern parts of the country, where there might be some resistance but a lot of passivity as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=161.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiCI9UZm4s&t=191.0s)]
