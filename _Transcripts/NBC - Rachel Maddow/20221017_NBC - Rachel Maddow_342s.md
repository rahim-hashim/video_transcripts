# Republican Authoritarianism Adds Familiar Antisemitic Accompaniment
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ)
*  But one of the lessons that emerges quickly when you spend time looking at this history [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of the violent ultra-right, not just internationally, but here in the United States, one of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=4.68s)]
*  things that just comes home again and again is that fascist, violent authoritarian messaging [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=9.6s)]
*  very, very, very often comes with a big heaping helping of anti-Semitism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=15.56s)]
*  People who want to throw a government by force, people who want to get rid of democratically [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=22.98s)]
*  elected leaders and instead install some leader using violence, whipping people up toward believing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=27.18s)]
*  that there's no political solution, that there has to be violence instead, that there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=32.82s)]
*  are enemies who have infiltrated the country and so the whole thing needs to be burned [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=35.94s)]
*  down and cleansed and started over this time with us in charge. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=39.5s)]
*  And that whole line of argument, that whole form of insidious messaging depends on their [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=43.06s)]
*  being an other, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=49.9s)]
*  Some sort of very powerful cabal that's secretly in charge and pulling all the strings and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=51.74s)]
*  they need to be rooted out again and again and again over time and in lots of different [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=56.22s)]
*  countries but including in ours. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=61.42s)]
*  That is core to fascist and authoritarian messaging. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=63.58s)]
*  And Jewish people are perennially targeted, scapegoated and insinuated against by people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=66.94s)]
*  who are making those kinds of arguments. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  It happens over and over again around the world and in our history too, even though [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=74.1s)]
*  we don't often like to remember it happening here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=77.9s)]
*  We like to look back at the late 30s and the 40s and remember that we were the country [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=80.48s)]
*  that joined the fight against Hitler and stopped what he was doing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=84.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=87.22000000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=88.22000000000001s)]
*  And also, there's this truth is stranger than fiction dark history of the forces in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=89.22s)]
*  our country who wanted us either not to fight Germany or if we were going to fight, they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=96.5s)]
*  wanted us to fight on Hitler's side. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=102.14000000000001s)]
*  This is all imagery from the United States that we're showing here on the screen right [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=105.78s)]
*  now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=108.62s)]
*  There were powerful, well-connected and indeed well-armed forces in the United States in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=112.34s)]
*  the lead up to World War II who wanted us fighting on Hitler's side because of what [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=116.7s)]
*  Hitler was saying about Jewish people and what he was doing to Jewish people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=120.94s)]
*  We had an ultra-right movement here in America that sided with that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=125.86s)]
*  80, 85 years ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=130.9s)]
*  And the fight against them back then, I think, is fascinating. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=134.28s)]
*  And that's what I've been working on with this podcast. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=137.86s)]
*  I think that there's a lot for us to learn from the Americans who went before us who [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  had to fight against that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=143.06s)]
*  But if you study this stuff in history, right, I mean, it's almost unbelievable that it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=145.06s)]
*  happened at all when it happened. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=150.5s)]
*  But then when you're in the middle of studying that history, you have news cycles like the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=153.22s)]
*  one we're in right now, and it feels all the more impossible that this is what's happening [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=162.3s)]
*  I mean, in our current news cycle right now, you've got the immediate former president [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=163.3s)]
*  of the United States putting out a statement on social media that's some kind of ominous, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=167.58s)]
*  vague warning for Americans who are Jewish, saying Jews need to be more appreciative of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=171.34s)]
*  him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=176.3s)]
*  Jews need to, quote, get their act together. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=177.3s)]
*  He says, quote, before it's too late. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=179.5s)]
*  Nobody knows what he's talking about or what he's threatening American Jews with here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=183.06s)]
*  But this is really happening now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=187.34s)]
*  We're three weeks out from the next election. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=192.86s)]
*  After the last one, when he sent an armed mob of his supporters to try to violently [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=195.02s)]
*  overthrow the government and stop the transfer of power and make him leader by force of arms. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=198.58s)]
*  Last week, the Republican Party posted this on social media. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  Kanye, Elon, Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  The latter, of course, is the guy who just posted the Jews better get their act together [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  message. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  The former is the guy who just posted that while he was sleepy right the second, as soon [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  as he woke up, he was going to go DEATH CON 3 on Jewish people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=217.3s)]
*  The middle guy in that triad is the one who has reportedly been in direct contact with [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=223.38s)]
*  the fascist dictator in Russia who's currently waging war on Ukraine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=229.62s)]
*  He's the guy who's recently been promoting an appeasement plan to get Western countries [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=234.78s)]
*  to back off and just let the Russian dictator keep whatever parts of other countries he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=238.54s)]
*  wants to invade and occupy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=242.7s)]
*  And we should leave him alone to do it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=244.3s)]
*  So the House Republican tweet naming those three guys as the Holy Trinity of the Republican [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=247.14s)]
*  Party right now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=251.94s)]
*  Kanye, Elon, Trump, that's still up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=253.46s)]
*  With the before it's too late threat that the Jews need to get their act together, with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=259.78s)]
*  the going DEATH CON 3 on Jewish people threat, and also with the guy in touch with Putin [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=264.3s)]
*  trying to get everybody else to back off and let him invade who he wants. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=268.9s)]
*  That's still up from an official Republican Party Twitter account. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=272.74s)]
*  And all of this is, it is a good reminder that anti-Semitism and authoritarianism very, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=279.82s)]
*  very, very often go together. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=287.42s)]
*  It is also a reminder that neither of these things are fights that are consigned to history. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=289.82s)]
*  I mean, our generation gets our turn in the barrel with these things now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=294.02s)]
*  Whatever you might have admired about Americans in the past who confronted these things in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=298.14s)]
*  the past, well now's your chance to emulate what they did that you think was right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=301.86s)]
*  Whatever you might have resented or been disappointed in, in thinking about Americans in the past, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=306.18s)]
*  who didn't rise to the occasion, who stuck their heads in the sand, who pretended it [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=309.82s)]
*  wasn't happening, who let it slide, well now's your chance to not emulate them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=313.46s)]
*  Because this is our turn with this stuff. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJuTwlIJjQ&t=319.21999999999997s)]
