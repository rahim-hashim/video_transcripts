# How to prosecute a prominent political figure with a hostile base of supporters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg)
*  Ron, do you have any advice that you can share, any sort of lessons learned that you can share [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=0.0s)]
*  from your experience with Mr. Skolnick and Mr. Baker as young prosecutors working on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=4.8s)]
*  this case? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=9.36s)]
*  When the vice president, who had this incredibly supportive, rabid, hard-edged base that hung [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=10.84s)]
*  on his every word and loved what he did, maybe even loved him more aggressively than they [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=16.62s)]
*  loved Nixon as president, when he turned his venom on you and on your superiors at the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=20.54s)]
*  Justice Department. And really, they brought a lot of pressure to bear on you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  I wondered if you could sort of through the TV screen tonight address the members of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=30.24s)]
*  Fulton County District Attorney's Office, the member of the New York District Attorney's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=38.28s)]
*  Office, the member of the special counsel's team in the Justice Department in Washington, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=41.32s)]
*  these other prosecutors who are contending with charges or potential charges against [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=44.64s)]
*  Trump and the kind of venom that he's bringing to bear against them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=48.32s)]
*  How did you guys bear up? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  How did you stay resilient and stay focused? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=52.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, it would be presumptuous for me to be teaching all these prosecutors [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=56.92s)]
*  how to suck eggs. They know how to do that. Part of it was youth, I suppose, but part [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=64.08s)]
*  of it was really believing in our job. Our job as advocates for the United States was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=69.64s)]
*  to bring a case, to investigate a case, if the case was there, to bring it, if it wasn't, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=75.72s)]
*  to let it stop and not pursue it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=81.4s)]
*  I remember vividly watching Agnew on TV and my little apartment in Baltimore sitting there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  with my wife while Agnew was saying, I will not resign if indicted, I will not resign [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  if indicted, saying terrible things about the three of us. It's noise. And any seasoned [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  prosecutor knows it's noise. You put your head down, you do your job as I'm sure they [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=104.44s)]
*  are doing, and you speak in court. That's it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=109.56s)]
*  Everybody keeps saying we're in uncharted territory and uncharted waters. It's not true. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=113.0s)]
*  You and your colleagues charted these waters for us in many significant ways 50 years ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=120.04s)]
*  And the country owes you a debt and owes it to you and to all of us to remember how it went down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=126.84s)]
*  Ron Liebman, former assistant U.S. attorney from Maryland from 1972 to 1979, one of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=133.96s)]
*  prosecution team that brought Vice President Spiro Agnew to the end of his political history. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=138.84s)]
*  Ron, thank you for your time and expertise tonight. It's always good to see you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=144.6s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=148.28s)]
*  you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpXCvt13odg&t=168.76s)]
