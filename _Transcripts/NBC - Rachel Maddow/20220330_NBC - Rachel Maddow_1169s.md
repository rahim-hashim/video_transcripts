# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 29
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M)
*  On November 8th, 1973, the top story leading the news was the high stakes diplomatic peace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=0.0s)]
*  talks happening between two nations at war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=5.68s)]
*  Israel and Egypt were meeting for initial negotiations to try to end the Yom Kippur [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=8.72s)]
*  War. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=13.4s)]
*  It was a huge deal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=14.4s)]
*  The war had claimed thousands of lives by that point. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=15.4s)]
*  The peace talks led the news that night ahead of another historic domestic crisis that was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  playing out before the American public. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=24.32s)]
*  The Watergate special prosecutors today finally found a significant discrepancy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=28.16s)]
*  The discrepancy strongly suggested that someone interrupted the automatic White House recording [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=33.04s)]
*  system in the hours immediately before or after important conversations between the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  president and John Dean. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=43.56s)]
*  The Watergate special prosecutors described the inconsistency between the White House [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=45.32s)]
*  logs and the automatic recording equipment as unexplained and substantial. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=50.0s)]
*  The Watergate missing tapes, 18 and a half minutes of conversations between the president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=57.28s)]
*  and his advisors that mysteriously went missing during the Watergate investigation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  President Nixon would eventually blame the missing tapes on his secretary, Rosemary Woods. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=67.36s)]
*  Nixon's secretary played along and even tried to physically demonstrate how she might have [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=72.72s)]
*  deleted the recordings to an incredulous press who dubbed her explanation the Rosemary stretch. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  Those missing 18 and a half minutes would become an infamous and enduring part of the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=83.88s)]
*  Watergate cover-up for years to come. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  Now today as Russia and Ukraine engage in peace talks, none other than Watergate reporter [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Bob Woodward and his reporting partner Bob Costa broke a new story about missing Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  White House records. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  Here's the headline from the Washington Post, quote, January 6th, White House logs given [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=104.8s)]
*  to House show seven hour gap in Trump calls. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=108.96s)]
*  Washington Post reports that records of Trump's phone calls turned over to January 6th investigators [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=113.6s)]
*  have a seven hour and 37 minute gap from just before the insurrection started until right [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=118.88s)]
*  around the time the police started clearing the Capitol. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=126.16s)]
*  The records that do exist show Trump called at least eight people in the first two and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=129.56s)]
*  half hours of his morning and another 11 people in the evening on January 6th, but from roughly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=134.52s)]
*  11 a.m. to nearly 7 p.m. as the Capitol was being attacked, nothing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that the January 6th investigation, quote, is now investigating [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=147.36s)]
*  whether Trump communicated that day through back channels, phones or of aids or personal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  disposable phones known as burner phones, end quote. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=157.88s)]
*  The committee is also scrutinizing whether it received the full logs from that day with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=162.76s)]
*  one lawmaker on the panel saying the committee is investigating a possible cover up of the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=166.96s)]
*  official White House record. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=172.32s)]
*  Joining us now, Dan Goldman, former assistant United States attorney, former majority counsel [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=174.52s)]
*  during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=179.16s)]
*  Dan, good to see you tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=181.76s)]
*  How big a deal is this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  This nearly eight hour gap in White House call records on the day of the attack. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  Do they indicate a likely cover up? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=190.04s)]
*  And is there a way for the investigators to actually figure out what happened in that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  time and get those records? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=195.76s)]
*  Well, it certainly indicates something nefarious because either the Trump administration concealed [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=198.68s)]
*  the logs, erased them or did not include them when they turned over presidential records [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=205.56s)]
*  to the National Archives, which is where the January 6th committee got the logs from. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=211.48s)]
*  Or it means that he was trying to avoid a record of the phone calls that he was making [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=217.2s)]
*  during the insurrection. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=224.64s)]
*  So there's no real good possible explanation for him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  We do know, though, that he made phone calls during that time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  We know that he called Senator Tommy Tuberville, but used called on Mike Lee, Senator Mike [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=234.04s)]
*  Lee's phone. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=239.54s)]
*  We know that he spoke to Kevin McCarthy after the rioters bombarded the Capitol. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=240.72s)]
*  So we know that there were phone calls. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=249.32s)]
*  And the way that the January 6th committee can try to sort of reverse engineer what occurred [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=252.28s)]
*  that day is through other witnesses and other phone records. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=259.12s)]
*  And they can analyze those phone records that they've gotten, some of which are subject [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=263.08s)]
*  to litigation right now, but others I'm sure that they have, and try to determine who [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=267.9s)]
*  those other people were talking to and whether they were speaking with Donald Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=274.29999999999995s)]
*  They can also match that up with testimony from other witnesses who might have said that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  they spoke to Trump on that day. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  So there are ways of figuring it out, but it is certainly an alarming and very conspicuous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=286.0s)]
*  absence of information. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=291.88s)]
*  So in response to today's report, Donald Trump claimed he didn't even know what a burner [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=296.3s)]
*  phone was. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=300.74s)]
*  Now, the former Trump official, John Bolton, has already rebutted that today, saying that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=301.74s)]
*  the president spoke about burner phones apparently all the time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=306.3s)]
*  Can the committee subpoena something like burner phone records? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=310.18s)]
*  Do things like that exist? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=313.58s)]
*  No, that's the whole point of a burner phone. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=315.5s)]
*  They're often used by drug dealers and mobsters to evade detection. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=319.42s)]
*  They're bought in other, they're prepaid phones essentially, that don't require you to give [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=325.3s)]
*  truthful identification information. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=331.42s)]
*  You can go into any store and just buy a prepaid phone for 30 days or a certain number of minutes, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=333.7s)]
*  and you don't have to give any information. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=339.74s)]
*  And so that's why criminals use them, is they're really not traceable and you can't figure [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=342.38s)]
*  out who is talking on them unless you get someone on the other end of the phone who [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=347.38s)]
*  says, oh, yeah, this number that I called was, you know, Joe Schmoe, and that's how [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=353.02000000000004s)]
*  you can figure it out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=357.82s)]
*  So burner phones are widely used by criminal enterprises so that a record of phone calls [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=359.54s)]
*  does not exist. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=367.54s)]
*  Dan Goldman, you and I have had some weird conversations over the years, but talking [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=371.86s)]
*  about a president using a burner phone definitely is somewhere close to the top of the list. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=374.86s)]
*  Good to see you, my friend. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=379.22s)]
*  Dan Goldman is a former assistant United States attorney and former majority counsel in the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  first impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=384.06s)]
*  Back in the United States, the Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy reacted to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  the peace talks and to Russia's announcement of a military pullback from Kiev this way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=392.5s)]
*  He said, quote, not coincidental that this announcement comes a day after the Ukrainians [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=397.86s)]
*  new offensive likely achieved its biggest victory, the recapture of the key Kiev suburb [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=403.14000000000004s)]
*  of Irpin. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=409.3s)]
*  The Russians were potentially on the verge of a series of routes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=410.3s)]
*  End quote. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=414.18s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Murphy is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=415.18s)]
*  Senator, thanks for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  I want to ask you about the proposal that some of the Ukrainians have made, and that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=421.18s)]
*  is that if they can't join NATO, can can there be a mechanism set up by which their territorial [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=425.58s)]
*  integrity is protected and that others will come? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=431.3s)]
*  Someone else will come to their defense if Russia tries this nonsense again. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=434.82s)]
*  What do you what do you think about the likelihood of a suggestion like that working? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=439.06s)]
*  Well, that is the essence of NATO, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=445.3s)]
*  NATO is a mutual defense treaty in which we pledge to those that are part of that alliance [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=447.66s)]
*  that if they are attacked, that all of the members will come to their defense. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=455.78s)]
*  So it sounds as if Ukraine is asking to have the rights that NATO members enjoy while not [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=459.74s)]
*  being a member of NATO. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=467.54s)]
*  You know, that's obviously something that the United States and our allies can discuss. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=469.62s)]
*  But, you know, that's a fairly serious commitment to make, to have the United States guarantee [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=475.82s)]
*  the protection of Ukraine outside of the confines of NATO. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=482.42s)]
*  Obviously, everybody wants to talk about ways to bring this war to a close. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=486.86s)]
*  And I think many of us will be willing to look at any asks that Zelensky makes of us. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=492.74s)]
*  You know, a number of people I'm speaking to on the ground here are saying regular Ukrainian [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=497.38s)]
*  citizens, some of them are refugees who from other parts internally displaced people who [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=505.18s)]
*  have left their homes in eastern Ukraine or even Kiev and have come here to Lviv. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=509.58s)]
*  And they're all saying, why should Russia, why should Ukraine make any concessions whatsoever? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=513.86s)]
*  They don't even think this should be called a war because they didn't feel that they were [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=518.1s)]
*  party to it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=521.9s)]
*  And they're concerned that in negotiations, just like with Crimea and the Donbas, they're [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=523.9s)]
*  going to end up giving something up for no reason. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=530.06s)]
*  I think the United States should be careful to dictate the terms of a peace agreement [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  to President Zelensky. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=541.5799999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky has been incredible in his leadership throughout the first four weeks [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=544.74s)]
*  of this war, and he will make a decision on behalf of his country, along with the Rada, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  as to whether the terms on the table are acceptable or unacceptable. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=554.86s)]
*  It is certainly a hard pill to swallow, the idea that as Russia is retreating from Kiev, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=559.06s)]
*  that Ukraine would grant them territorial control over one inch of Ukrainian land. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  But there are clearly things that can be on the table. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=573.06s)]
*  The neutrality of Ukraine can be on the table. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=576.38s)]
*  Devolved power for eastern regions can be on the table. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=579.82s)]
*  And I think the United States is willing to put some things on the table as well. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=584.14s)]
*  We've never had the intent of putting missiles inside of Ukraine that would threaten Russia, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=588.22s)]
*  and we can make some commitments to give Russia confidence that that is not in the cards after [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=593.22s)]
*  this war ends. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=600.18s)]
*  It's up to Zelensky and his team as to what the terms will be. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=601.9799999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't dictate those to him. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=606.5s)]
*  But our commitment is if you are not ready to sign an agreement, if the terms are too [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=608.2199999999999s)]
*  difficult or too onerous and you continue to fight, the United States is going to stick [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=614.6999999999999s)]
*  with you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=618.4799999999999s)]
*  You've met with him four or five times. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  What's your sense of how he's been performing, Zelensky? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  He's blown me away. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=632.02s)]
*  I probably sat with Zelensky for more time than anyone else in the Senate. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=633.02s)]
*  I would lie to you if I would tell you I wasn't a bit surprised at how he has been able to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=636.82s)]
*  rally not just all of Ukraine, but the entire world. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=643.1800000000001s)]
*  Listen, Zelensky knows how to use the media, and there's nothing more important in the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=647.1s)]
*  early days of a war than using mass media in order to win the propaganda battle. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=653.4200000000001s)]
*  It's pretty stunning that Russia, a country that prided itself on being able to win the [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=659.66s)]
*  information wars, is in a position that they are getting their hat handed to them every [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=664.42s)]
*  single day, both militarily on the ground inside Ukraine, but also when it comes to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=669.9399999999999s)]
*  the messaging. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=675.18s)]
*  Putin is in a corner not just because he's been on the receiving end of an incredibly [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=676.18s)]
*  impressive military performance from the Ukrainians, but also because he simply doesn't have any [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=683.78s)]
*  friends who are willing to come to his aid. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=690.5s)]
*  I don't think he counted on losing both the military battle and the propaganda battle. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=692.9s)]
*  Let's talk about something that John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesperson, said earlier today [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=698.46s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=703.1s)]
*  Let's listen together. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=704.4200000000001s)]
*  They failed to take Kiev, which we believe was a key objective. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=706.1s)]
*  Not only did they not manage to take Kiev, they've not managed to take any population [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=714.06s)]
*  centers, and the Ukrainians have been fighting back very hard. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=716.74s)]
*  So it's hard to see how they are succeeding in any one place except at the death and destruction [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=719.66s)]
*  they're causing. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=728.26s)]
*  He's talking a lot about the death and destruction, and a number of people have wondered over [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=731.74s)]
*  the last few days whether the failure, the tactical failure of the Russian military on [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=736.3s)]
*  the ground, the failure to take places like Kiev, the failure to make more progress is [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=741.86s)]
*  now being compensated for by Russia with this death, with this destruction, with the scorched [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=746.38s)]
*  earth policy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=752.58s)]
*  Tell me your thoughts on this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=753.58s)]
*  Yes, that is scorched earth policy. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=755.38s)]
*  That's the best term. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=759.14s)]
*  And yes, I think they want to use this terror just to make Ukraine to accept their demands. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=761.3000000000001s)]
*  They want to make Ukraine to surrender. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=771.58s)]
*  They are again making a mistake. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=774.74s)]
*  Like they made a mistake attacking Ukraine, thinking that their state will collapse, that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=777.46s)]
*  people will not fight for their land. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=783.82s)]
*  And they made a big mistake, as the whole world now sees that Ukrainians are fighting [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=786.82s)]
*  enormously with all fury for their land. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=792.1s)]
*  The same is with this. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=796.62s)]
*  They are trying to scare our people. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=799.26s)]
*  They just make them more furious, and that will not work. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=800.66s)]
*  But what can be done by the world, not just watching at least all full pictures, but to [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=805.14s)]
*  help us, is to provide Ukraine with air defence. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=810.26s)]
*  Because for all these attacks, mostly they're using air or aircraft or missiles, which can [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=813.9s)]
*  be intercepted by air defence. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=819.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, Ukraine is still waiting. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=821.94s)]
*  The second month of war is on the place, but we are still waiting for really powerful air [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=824.98s)]
*  defence systems. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=830.98s)]
*  So we are not asking for NATO specialists, but we are asking for weapons which will protect [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=832.54s)]
*  our women and children and which will stop this awful refugee crisis. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=838.46s)]
*  Because more than three million Ukrainians already left the country, but more than six [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=843.54s)]
*  millions Ukrainians are internally displaced people. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=848.3000000000001s)]
*  So they are in the country. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=851.58s)]
*  They want to come back to their homes, but they can't do this. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=853.4599999999999s)]
*  And if these attacks will not be stopped, they will also probably, at least part of [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=857.4599999999999s)]
*  them, will need to leave the country and the refugee crisis will worsen. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=861.9799999999999s)]
*  Alex, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=866.42s)]
*  Alex Gonshurenko is a member of the Ukrainian parliament. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=868.9s)]
*  Here in Lviv, life feels ordinary throughout much of the day. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=874.06s)]
*  This cosmopolitan city had been mostly spared from Russian attacks until Saturday, when [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=878.58s)]
*  missiles came raining down in two separate strikes. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=884.34s)]
*  No one was killed, but the feeling of security has been shattered for many Ukrainians, including [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=888.58s)]
*  those who fled from the east, who sought refuge in Lviv, which is just an hour from the Polish border. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=893.74s)]
*  There are signs of war here, but life goes on until the evening curfew. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=900.26s)]
*  This group of young people fled Kiev after airstrikes hit that city. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=905.3s)]
*  You decided to come here to escape that and now it's happening here as well. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=909.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=913.74s)]
*  And in this moment we're like, where can we go for a safe place? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=914.74s)]
*  And there's no safe place in Ukraine, I think, right now. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=920.0999999999999s)]
*  When you hear the alarm, the sirens, do you change anything? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=923.4599999999999s)]
*  If there was a siren right now, would you keep drinking your coffee and eating your cake? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=926.8199999999999s)]
*  No, I think not. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=930.5799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=932.78s)]
*  You'd get up, you'd leave? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=934.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=935.02s)]
*  I'd probably come back. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=936.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=937.02s)]
*  Then, just moments after we left them. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=938.02s)]
*  All right, what we've got is a typical day right here in the middle of Lviv. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=940.02s)]
*  The air raid sirens have just begun. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=945.78s)]
*  They've just gone on. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=948.38s)]
*  There are usually two sets. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=949.8199999999999s)]
*  The starting set, where they're announcing, please take shelter, there is an air raid. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  There'll be another set in half an hour or whenever they've determined that there isn't [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=955.78s)]
*  and that will be the return to your activities. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=960.92s)]
*  There's an app that everybody carries with them that goes red when there's an air raid [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=963.92s)]
*  like this. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  This siren indicates that there is an actual air raid. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  You will see people start to disperse. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=973.04s)]
*  They'll start to head to places that are shelters. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=974.9599999999999s)]
*  A lot of these stores around where we are right now in this cafe district have shelter [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=977.36s)]
*  in them. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=983.56s)]
*  They're not real bunkers that are designed for an attack, but there are some shelter. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=984.56s)]
*  They are in the basement. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=988.5999999999999s)]
*  What you'll also see is a lot of people who do nothing. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=989.92s)]
*  They don't change their behavior at all. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=993.04s)]
*  They're going to stay. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=994.8s)]
*  They're going to be walking around the streets. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=995.92s)]
*  And basically until last weekend, that's how it went because when there was an air raid [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=997.6s)]
*  siren, it covers a very, very large area. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1002.24s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean there's a missile or something headed in this direction, but [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1005.2s)]
*  you can see there are people grabbing each other's hands, moving a little quickly, going [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1009.88s)]
*  into these shelters, returning home and things like that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1014.24s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who are staying outside right now, hoping it will pass in [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1017.78s)]
*  a few minutes. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1022.86s)]
*  This is still a city that is thought of by the people who are here as safe. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1024.1s)]
*  Many of them are not from here. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1027.98s)]
*  They've come from places like Keith and from places further east where there has been actual [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1029.42s)]
*  shelling so they feel that this is actually a relatively safe place to be despite the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1034.1399999999999s)]
*  air raid sirens. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1039.34s)]
*  But not everyone feels safe. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1041.82s)]
*  Once the sirens began blaring, we discovered this family had scrambled for cover in this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1043.94s)]
*  concrete shelter. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1048.74s)]
*  They're refugees from the besieged northeastern Ukraine town of Sumy near the Russian border. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1050.46s)]
*  It was a very terrible situation. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1057.14s)]
*  It was very scary. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1059.46s)]
*  So we had to leave our home and our region. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1061.38s)]
*  Standing in this shelter with their kids, it felt like the war was following them. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1066.6200000000001s)]
*  A few minutes ago we heard the air raid sirens. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1071.7800000000002s)]
*  Is that why you came under here? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1076.3400000000001s)]
*  We saved our lives and our children. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1078.3400000000001s)]
*  Now we plan to stay here. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1083.3400000000001s)]
*  We hope that the situation may be changed. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1085.3400000000001s)]
*  We hope of this. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1091.3400000000001s)]
*  So I don't want to leave and go far from this city. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1093.74s)]
*  In just one afternoon, the sights and sounds of this city can be surreal, but some Ukrainians [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1105.84s)]
*  here are determined to not let a war change their routine, even if it's just sitting outside [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1115.24s)]
*  on a spring day with a coffee and some cake. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1120.94s)]
*  Your life is not going to change your coffee and your cake. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1124.74s)]
*  You're here with me. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1126.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here with you too. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1128.74s)]
*  But you're teaching me about what this means. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1130.74s)]
*  We will die together maybe. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1132.74s)]
*  Let's live together. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1134.74s)]
*  Let's live together. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1136.74s)]
*  Snapshot of life here in Lviv in the second month of Russia's invasion. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1141.74s)]
*  Life goes on while it still can. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wLmEqsK6M&t=1146.44s)]
