# U.S., NATO Dance Around Definition Of 'Co-Combatant' With Military Aid To Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE)
*  President Zelensky released this video today showing him back in his presidential office in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=0.0s)]
*  Kiev for the first time since the war began, not in the fortified bunker that he's usually been [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  broadcasting from. Zelensky is putting all the pressure he can on the United States and NATO [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=11.84s)]
*  to give his country more help. He's going to address the British House of Commons via live [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=18.16s)]
*  video conference tomorrow. This weekend, he spoke with more than 200 members of the U.S. House and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=22.72s)]
*  Senate. When asked what he needs most, Zelensky reportedly told the lawmakers he needs jet fighters. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=28.72s)]
*  The catch, though, is that Ukrainian pilots don't know how to fly American jets. As a former Soviet [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=35.68s)]
*  republic, they fly Russian MiG fighter jets. And so one idea being floated is that Poland would [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=43.2s)]
*  give Ukraine some of its old Soviet-made MiGs, and the United States would then give Poland, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=49.76s)]
*  which is a NATO ally, American jets to replace them, like F-16s. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=56.8s)]
*  We're looking actively now at the question of airplanes that Poland may provide to Ukraine, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  and looking at how we might be able to backfill should Poland decide to supply those planes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=71.44s)]
*  Society is more complicated than it sounds, by the way. The U.S. and its NATO allies are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  trying to give Ukraine as much help as they can without actually getting into a war with Russia, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=84.56s)]
*  without becoming a so-called co-combatant in the conflict. And no one can really say for certain [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  where that actual line is. As one senior American national security official warned in the New York [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=94.48s)]
*  Times this weekend, the American legal definitions of what constitutes entering the war are not the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  same as Vladimir Putin's definitions. For instance, the Kremlin has warned NATO countries against [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=105.84s)]
*  letting themselves be used as bases for Ukraine's remaining air force, saying that if Ukrainian [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=112.08s)]
*  planes attack Russian forces from a NATO country, Russia is going to consider that country part of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=118.0s)]
*  the conflict. So Poland is understandably nervous about this plane swap idea. Ukrainian planes [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't be attacking Russians from Poland, but Poland would be giving the planes to the Ukrainian [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=131.04s)]
*  air force. So would Russia then consider Poland a co-combatant? Here in Hungary, whose president [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=135.6s)]
*  has been vocally pro-Putin right until Putin invaded Ukraine, Hungary's kind of split the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=142.88s)]
*  difference. They're allowing NATO troops to be stationed in this country, not anywhere near me, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=149.2s)]
*  it's got to be west of the Danube River near Budapest. But they will not allow weapons to be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=154.24s)]
*  shipped through Ukraine through their territory. Weapons destined for Ukraine can and have entered [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=159.6s)]
*  Hungary, but they cannot cross into Ukraine, a thousand feet from where I am, from this country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=165.44s)]
*  They've got to go into a third country first. My team shot this footage today in a town just a few [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=172.24s)]
*  miles from here, the Hungarian military beefing up its presence near the border, clearly preparing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  for something. We actually tried to bring you this show tonight from their barracks. They initially [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=183.68s)]
*  agreed and then they respectfully declined, offering to help us find other locations from which to do [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=189.84s)]
*  the show. So we return to a place we know, this tiny village center, where it's lights out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Refugees arrive, as you can see, by the busload about every hour. Okay, I want to go back to these [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=200.56s)]
*  jets again. Whether the U.S. ends up finding a way to get fighter jets to Ukraine, the scale of the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=206.88s)]
*  other weaponry that they have managed to get to the Ukrainian military in recent days is staggering. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=212.88s)]
*  The New York Times and CNN report that the U.S. and NATO have delivered 17,000 Javelin anti-tank [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=218.88s)]
*  weapons, 2,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles in less than a week, unloading them from giant cargo [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=226.56s)]
*  planes in Poland and Romania, where they are transported across the border by land. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbI01FnY_mE&t=233.52s)]
