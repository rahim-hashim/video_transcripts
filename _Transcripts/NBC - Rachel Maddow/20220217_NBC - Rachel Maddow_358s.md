# Trump, Deep In Debt, Faces Dwindling Options To Preserve Faltering Business
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80)
*  So what happens to these loans now that Trump has been deemed unreliable by his own accountants? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Suzanne Craig, one of the reporters who broke that story about Trump's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=6.4s)]
*  debts. She and her Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting team have done by far the most [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=10.8s)]
*  in-depth reporting on Trump's finances since he was president. Great to see you tonight, Suzanne. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=15.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=21.04s)]
*  So you reported in 2020 that Trump had personally guaranteed $420 million in loans for his own [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=22.56s)]
*  company. Who does he owe all this money to? Well, it's a small group of lenders and it's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=29.2s)]
*  interesting if we step back and we think about, you know, there's been a lot of talk about now that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=36.08s)]
*  not only this has happened that his accountants have stepped back, but the chief financial officer [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=41.12s)]
*  of his company is under indictment, his company is under indictment, a lot going on here, you know, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=45.92s)]
*  that the covenants could be breached. And he has, just in the coming couple years, hundreds of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  millions of dollars that he's going to have to renegotiate. And he, you know, the accounting firm [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=57.04s)]
*  is, you know, what we heard about this week. And I went back after I heard about the news and I [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=63.04s)]
*  found in a filing that was in January, it kind of took on new meaning, that there is another [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=68.96s)]
*  accounting firm that's in place, a firm named Whitley Penn. So that's like a first step. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=75.44s)]
*  They're out of Texas. So he's moved to at least get another firm in place, at least for some of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=80.0s)]
*  his accounting. But what happens to all these loans? And the first one that comes up, and it's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=84.88s)]
*  coming up this year, is on the Trump Tower. There's a hundred million dollar loan there that he's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  going to have to renegotiate. If this was a public company, you'd be like, wow, like, it would just be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  so much trouble for them because I think their stock would tank, there would be so many ramifications. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  But in this case, I think on that loan, he may be able to renegotiate it. I mean, I think it's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  going to probably be at a higher rate. But he knows the lender, the lender's friendly to his company, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=109.76s)]
*  and it's on Trump Tower. And occupancy rates have gone down on Trump Tower. But I still think he'll [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=115.44s)]
*  probably be able to get that one maybe over the line with higher rates. But there's other loans [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  that are going to be more difficult. I think about Doral is one. Doral, he bought it in 2012. He [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=128.16s)]
*  spent, you know, hundred and some million dollars to buy that golf course. He's losing a huge amount [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=135.44s)]
*  of money. He's pumped more than $200 million in capital into it. And Deutsche Bank is the lender. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=140.16s)]
*  Deutsche Bank has been signaling that they may not want to do new business with him. So I think when [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=146.0s)]
*  he comes up against that, you know, there could be some problems there. I mean, none of this is good [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=150.72s)]
*  news. And I just think when you think about how he's going to have to handle just this immediate [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=156.72s)]
*  debt, there's going to be potentially higher rates. And also just in some cases, you know, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=162.32s)]
*  I wonder who the lender is going to end up being. Well, I think we all are wondering whether the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=167.6s)]
*  charm of Donald Trump is going to be enough to just get away with a higher rate. And that's all. I mean, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=172.4s)]
*  also, side note, Donald Trump turns out not a great businessman. I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=177.04s)]
*  of millions of dollars on debt on properties that he's been pumping money into. I mean, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=183.6s)]
*  well, that's the thing. Yeah. And I think, you know, you were talking about the old post office [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=187.92s)]
*  earlier, and I was thinking, wow, you know, there's so much going on there. First of all, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  we don't know how much he is going to get out of that. Everybody's saying he's going to walk [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  away with it. You know, I think I've heard 70 million, 100 million. We don't know the terms [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  of that deal and that it is cash. He's going to have to pay back $170 million to his lender. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=204.0s)]
*  And we just don't know the terms of that deal. I'm always like, well, hang on. I just, I haven't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  seen that. And I just want to caution people about that. And then I also think about the old [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=213.84s)]
*  post office that he's selling it. He's selling, that's like the last asset that he actually, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=218.0s)]
*  you know, put a lot into. And he's selling it. He must need cash or he wouldn't be selling it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=224.4s)]
*  Like, that's one of the first things that I think of when I hear that. And I think we're going to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=230.24s)]
*  potentially see other asset sales. He has very few of his main assets, these golf courses that he [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=234.4s)]
*  has that are making money. He's got golf courses overseas. None of them are making money. I mean, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=241.28s)]
*  I've seen his tax returns. It's the exception when he has a business that is making money. In 2018, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=246.72s)]
*  last year that I've seen his tax returns, he lost $47 million in change, you know, a tax loss of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=253.04s)]
*  that. And then he headed in from there. He went into COVID where a lot of his properties were [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=261.76s)]
*  really struggling. I mean, this is not a company that's doing great and having banner years. It's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=267.36s)]
*  the opposite of that. I mean, I don't mean to, I'm not joking here when I say it's possible that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=272.72s)]
*  the only asset Trump may have in a few years that's worth anything is a potential bid at the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=279.6s)]
*  presidency. Is the, is the scepter of potential power that could keep people off of his back? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  Is that an overstatement to say? I mean, I mean, it just feels like- [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=291.04s)]
*  Well, I think he's got a couple. He's got, Mara Largo has made money in the past, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=293.44s)]
*  but there's very few that are. But I think you don't know sort of when you start, he's going to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=296.8s)]
*  start selling out. I think we're seeing that selling the old post office. I mean, that's a major sale [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  for him. And it's not something I would imagine somebody who, you know, it's not probably something [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=308.08s)]
*  he wanted to get rid of. And I think that that's what you're going to see as he moves forward in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=312.32s)]
*  order to keep these other properties going. You start looking for where you can raise cash and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=317.92s)]
*  do that by selling assets. And steaks and vodka and ties, I guess. Suzanne Craig, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=325.76s)]
*  investigative reporter for the New York Times. Thank you so much for your work and thanks for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=331.76s)]
*  joining us. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTcgrXOPE80&t=336.0s)]
