# Michigan Republicans, driven from power, reduced to 'ball kicking'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ)
*  In terms of our politics here at home, things are getting a little punchy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a little punchier than it ever should be, frankly. And we probably should have known to expect it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=3.2s)]
*  This is tape you might remember seeing from a few, just a couple of months ago. This was an incident [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=10.08s)]
*  in Michigan in April at a meeting of the Michigan Republican Party. A couple of county-level [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=15.36s)]
*  Republican Party officials in the state getting into kind of a slapping, shoving fight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=23.44s)]
*  Again, that was April of this year. Then this weekend, the same Republican Party, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=28.16s)]
*  the Michigan Republican Party, went back to this same hotel in Clare, Michigan, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=33.44s)]
*  for another statewide Republican Party meeting. And apparently there was yet another punch-up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=38.08s)]
*  Craig Mauger at the Detroit News was first to report on what happened in Michigan this weekend. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=44.08s)]
*  It's one of those reports that I can't really improve upon, so I'm just going to tell you, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=49.28s)]
*  give it to you as Mr. Mauger reported it in the Detroit paper. A Republican man from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=53.44s)]
*  Wayne County, Michigan, quote, acknowledged that he wiggled the knob of one door leading into the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=58.64s)]
*  meeting room while the meeting was underway. The chairman of the Clare County Republican Party [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=65.6s)]
*  heard the wiggling of the doorknob and walked over to the door where he says he saw someone [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  through a small window in the door flip him off. Quote, the Clare County Republican Party chairman [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=77.68s)]
*  then opened the door and says, quote, he kicked me in the balls as soon as I opened the door. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=84.56s)]
*  The scuffle intensified. And long story short, the Clare County Republican Party chairman provided [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=92.0s)]
*  this account to the Detroit News in a phone interview from an emergency room in Clare, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=97.92000000000002s)]
*  Michigan, an emergency room in which he says he was being treated for what was believed to be a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  broken rib. The man who did the alleged flipping off and then the alleged ball kicking of the other [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=107.52s)]
*  Republican official, he told the Detroit News that he took off his glasses before engaging in these [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=115.44s)]
*  fisticuffs, telling the Detroit News, quote, when you see me taking my glasses off, I'm ready to rock. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=121.84s)]
*  Again, statewide Republican Party meeting in Michigan this weekend. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=131.2s)]
*  The news outlet Bridge Michigan has a little bit more after the Detroit News was first to report [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=135.52s)]
*  on what happened. Bridge notes that charges are likely going to be pressed in this case. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=140.88s)]
*  They also note that the man who did the alleged flipping off and the alleged ball kicking also [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=146.0s)]
*  has his own version of the story in which he says that he was not the aggressor. He says the other [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=151.44s)]
*  guy threatened him and that the other guy, quote, came out of the meeting with his dukes up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=156.4s)]
*  To say the least, this is not how anything in politics is supposed to go, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=164.16s)]
*  but this is how it's going in Michigan Republican politics. Two consecutive [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=168.16s)]
*  statewide Michigan Republican Party meetings, both at the same hotel in Clare, Michigan, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  both of which resulted in physical fights among Republicans who were there for the meeting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=179.04s)]
*  I should note that, I mean, I was going to say it's understandable to say that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=186.0s)]
*  I mean, I was going to say it's understandable. Tensions are high. It's not understandable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=191.92s)]
*  No matter how high tensions are, you don't need to kick anybody in the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=196.48s)]
*  hoozy wutsy at a political meeting for any reason. So there's no excuse for it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  But Michigan Republicans, you should know, are doing poorly right now in lots of different ways. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  This is one of the state parties that was just convulsed by former Republican President Donald [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=212.16s)]
*  Trump demanding that Michigan Republicans should find a way to overthrow the election [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=217.12s)]
*  results in that state and declare him the winner in 2020, even though he lost in Michigan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  The implications of that, the repercussions of that have been strange and are ongoing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  The state does now have an election denier as its state chairwoman. Michigan Republican Party [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=233.12s)]
*  chairwoman says that the, you know, Donald Trump's election claims should have resulted in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=238.88s)]
*  Michigan throwing out the vote results and instead declaring him the winner. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=244.4s)]
*  She also refused to acknowledge her own massive double digit loss in a statewide race when she [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  ran for secretary of state recently. In addition to her being the state party chair for the first [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=253.6s)]
*  time in four decades, Michigan Republicans hold no statewide offices and neither house of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=259.12s)]
*  legislature. They've never been as far out of power as they are now, at least not in the last 40 years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=265.04s)]
*  That said, Michigan Republicans are apparently still capable of breaking each other's ribs at meetings. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=270.72s)]
*  So they've got that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUskBtnjYQ&t=278.64000000000004s)]
