# Anti-Trump coalition awaits reassurances from Biden but remains steadfast against Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0)
*  Let's turn now to David Plouffe, former campaign manager for President Obama, who knows about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=0.0s)]
*  these kinds of situations and knows about these coalitions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=4.4s)]
*  David, I mean, I think we just have to face facts. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=8.76s)]
*  From a strategic perspective, the Democratic Party is a messier thing than the Republican [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Party. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=16.8s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump was getting convicted and all those guys went and dressed like him [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=17.8s)]
*  and stood outside the court. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=20.32s)]
*  That's not what the Democratic Party is right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=21.68s)]
*  It's got people who have differences. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=23.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=25.48s)]
*  We're not a cult. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=26.48s)]
*  I think we're having a healthy discussion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=27.48s)]
*  It does need to conclude at some point. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=29.4s)]
*  But I do think your example in France is important. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=31.68s)]
*  I believe still today in the battleground states, which is all that matters in a presidential [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=34.16s)]
*  race, that's the windshield we need to all look out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=39.56s)]
*  There are enough voters who are part of that anti-Trump coalition. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=42.86s)]
*  Now some of those are going to be pro-Biden. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=46.84s)]
*  Some of those are pro-Democrat. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=47.84s)]
*  Some are going to be aligned with us simply because they don't want to see a return of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=50.22s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=54.64s)]
*  Now, I think we have to be realistic about where the race is. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=55.64s)]
*  This time four years ago, Joe Biden led three to five points in states and nationally. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=58.4s)]
*  He's trailing by that and maybe a little bit more. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=64.72s)]
*  So if the race were held today and it's not, I think we would lose the White House. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  We'd probably also lose the Senate and then the House, the Republican trifecta. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=72.32s)]
*  So we've got time to turn that around because, again, I think there's a majority of voters [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=76.84s)]
*  out there are enough to win. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=81.2s)]
*  But I'd like to remind everybody we don't have 120 days. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=83.16s)]
*  That's not a long time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=86.72s)]
*  Ballots start going out 80, 90 days from now on battleground states. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  So the debate about whether Joe Biden should be our nominee will continue. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=91.72s)]
*  I think that right now it's clear he has no intention of leaving. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=97.08s)]
*  Until that changes, he's going to be the nominee. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=101.44s)]
*  The real question is, if in fact he is the nominee, and I think right now you'd have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=103.56s)]
*  to argue he's going to be, is how is the race going to change? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=106.6s)]
*  And I think that has to be prosecuting the case better against Trump for sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=111.4s)]
*  I don't think it's much. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=115.16s)]
*  Yes, his record is important, but elections, I learned, are always about the future. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=116.24s)]
*  What we have to paint here is Joe Biden's next four years versus Donald Trump's. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  That could be built on the record. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=124.16s)]
*  Trump's horrible record, Biden's strong record, but that's important. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  But the chief issue is voters, not just those that are criticizing voters, but rank and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=128.68s)]
*  file voters have to feel more confident in Biden's fitness. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=134.24s)]
*  And he's got to really seize every opportunity because if that number gets better, I think [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=137.96s)]
*  the race gets better. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=143.56s)]
*  And I think you can then access that anti-Trump coalition that clearly exists out there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=145.16s)]
*  And do you think that that conversation is happening the right way right now? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  What has to happen to convince voters to be more confident? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=157.28s)]
*  The reason I ask this is not about, I'm not talking about the debate performance, I'm [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  talking about inflation, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=162.72s)]
*  This administration has done a very good job with getting inflation under control. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  The numbers are increasing out of inflation, and yet we see polling numbers that indicate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=169.52s)]
*  to people that inflation is their biggest problem and they hold Joe Biden responsible [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=174.12s)]
*  for it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=179.08s)]
*  I mean, it's not logical, but it's out there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=180.08s)]
*  Well, listen, I think people are not going to change their view on their paycheck going [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=181.8s)]
*  less far than they would have liked because it's gotten better for a month or two. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  But the trajectory matters. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=190.68s)]
*  When Barack Obama won reelection in 2012, he won reelection with a historically high [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  unemployment rate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=196.52s)]
*  Voters had a sense that things were getting better, and I think Biden can tap into that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=198.12s)]
*  But I think we all have to realize that the reason the debate was so important and why [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=202.32s)]
*  the Biden campaign wanted to have the debate is they were losing heading into that debate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=206.04s)]
*  So the problem has become worse. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, everyday matters, the Democratic convention matters, the ads that are being run matters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  The next debate on September 10th, assuming that happens, matters. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=219.5s)]
*  Hopefully, Joe Biden will be out doing town halls with voters and, you know, prime time [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=222.6s)]
*  television programs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  There's going to be great interest in how he performs. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  And if he can, I think, perform a little bit better, both in terms of, you know, how he [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=231.72s)]
*  physically and verbally performs, but also prosecuting that case against Trump, because [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=237.44s)]
*  there is no doubt we know that 2025 agenda that Trump is now trying to run away from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=243.04s)]
*  it, that's a tell. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=248.12s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump doesn't run away from many of them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=249.12s)]
*  He's running away from that, even though he's all over it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=252.24s)]
*  His fingerprints are all over it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=254.72s)]
*  His people have written chapters, his name's in it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=256.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=259.2s)]
*  So you got to prosecute that case and say this is what you're going to get. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=260.2s)]
*  And by the way, I'm Joe Biden. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=262.64s)]
*  I care about average people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=263.8s)]
*  This is what I've done to fight inflation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=265.42s)]
*  We've got a manufacturing boom all over the country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=267.08s)]
*  We're going to continue to invest in health care. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=270.0s)]
*  And with Trump, you get the opposite. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=272.08s)]
*  You know, tens of millions of people kicked off health care. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=273.88s)]
*  He's going to run away from climate change. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=276.52s)]
*  And all its awful glory will be the new law of the land. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=280.12s)]
*  Like this is we have a lot of material. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=283.56s)]
*  And so that's the other thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=285.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is a very weak candidate. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=287.12s)]
*  He was weak in 16, but one in a black swan event. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  He lost in 20. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=292.72s)]
*  He's the reason his party had such a miserable 18 and 22 in part. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=294.36s)]
*  So this is a guy that can be beat, but he has to be beat. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=298.1s)]
*  You know, we know that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=302.36s)]
*  And that sounds like a silly thing to say. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=303.48s)]
*  I think as we all evaluate this question of Biden and then [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=305.26s)]
*  ultimately the question of how we run a campaign going forward, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=308.74s)]
*  it's not enough to give it a good effort. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=311.46s)]
*  You have to win the bricking race. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  And again, I think there's enough voters out there to put this together. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=317.18s)]
*  But the clock is ticking. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=320.38s)]
*  And I think the Biden campaign is very strong, great leadership [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=322.34s)]
*  and General Malley, Dillon and others running this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=325.58s)]
*  We've got great interest groups are going to make the case. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=327.46s)]
*  Great members of Congress. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=329.82s)]
*  Like I think there's a good support and cast. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=330.94s)]
*  But what I've learned in presidential races is it really comes down [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=333.86s)]
*  to the central characters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=336.74s)]
*  Now, in Donald Trump, we have a deeply flawed, very beatable Republican [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=337.86s)]
*  nominee. Right now, the Democratic nominee is not performing as we like. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=343.02s)]
*  And if he fixes that, then I think we've got a very good shot to hold [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=346.58s)]
*  on to the White House. But right now, we're behind in this race and we're [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=350.9s)]
*  behind pretty significantly in the battleground states. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=354.38s)]
*  And again, that's why we have campaigns. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=356.34s)]
*  You can change that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=358.18s)]
*  But nobody should make a mistake about where we are today. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=359.38s)]
*  David, good to see you as always. Thank you for being with us, David. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTuoINHu8d0&t=362.70000000000005s)]
