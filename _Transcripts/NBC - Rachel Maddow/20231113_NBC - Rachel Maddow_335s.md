Video Description: Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trump's older sister, who died today at age 86, last made national headlines in 2019 when she resigned from the federal judiciary, short-circuiting a court investigation that followed New York Times reporting on the Trump family’s tax practices. Rachel Maddow cites Trump Barry's resignation as an example of how institutions enforce a societal accountability separate from criminal justice.

# How fallout from a major Trump family scandal illustrates institutional self-policing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y)
*  Today, we also learned of the death of former President Trump's oldest sibling, his older [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  sister, Marianne Trump Barry. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=6.72s)]
*  She was a respected federal judge in New Jersey for most of her career. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=10.0s)]
*  She was on what's called senior status on the bench when her younger brother was elected [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=15.38s)]
*  president in 2016. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=20.26s)]
*  Senior status is a sort of semi-retirement that federal judges can stay in basically [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=22.12s)]
*  forever. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=26.68s)]
*  Marianne Trump Barry did a very unusual thing when her brother was president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=27.68s)]
*  She gave up senior status and resigned from the judiciary altogether. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=32.76s)]
*  That was in 2019. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=37.4s)]
*  It happened right after the New York Times exposed her role in what the paper described [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=39.56s)]
*  as a decades-long pattern of the Trump family engaging in what was alleged to be massive [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=45.0s)]
*  systemic tax fraud. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=52.2s)]
*  Judge Barry was alleged to be not just a financial beneficiary of the family's tax fraud, but [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  quote, she was in a position to influence the actions taken by her family. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=60.56s)]
*  Now, that is a serious moral and potentially legal allegation against anybody in any line [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=65.72s)]
*  of work. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  But if you're a federal judge, that is a serious ethics allegation for a sitting federal judge. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Those kinds of allegations, if proven, would certainly violate the judicial code of conduct [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  that applies to all federal judges other than the Supreme Court. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=82.28s)]
*  And so in the wake of the New York Times reporting on Judge Barry's involvement in this massive [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=87.68s)]
*  alleged tax fraud with her brother, President Trump, and other members of the Trump family, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=94.4s)]
*  the court that she sat on actually started investigating this as an ethics matter. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=100.28s)]
*  And 10 days after the court confirmed that they had started investigating her for this [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  alleged ethics breach, she resigned from the bench. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=110.28s)]
*  She gave up her lifetime tenure as a judge. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=114.56s)]
*  That is the one sure way she could call off that investigation because judicial conduct [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=118.28s)]
*  rules don't apply to retired judges. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  So she retired suddenly and without explanation 10 days after the investigation was announced [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=125.0s)]
*  and that killed the investigation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=131.24s)]
*  It is honestly one of the most serious substantive scandals ever associated with a presidential [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=134.12s)]
*  family member and we have had some doozies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=141.96s)]
*  But I mean, giving up lifetime tenure on the federal bench to avoid the investigation into [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=145.72s)]
*  these serious decades-long tax fraud allegations laid out against you with documentation in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=152.32s)]
*  the New York Times, specifically it seemed that retirement designed in such a way to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=158.56s)]
*  stop the investigation and let her get away with it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=164.08s)]
*  I mean that, like I said, we've had some doozies when it comes to presidential family members [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=167.84s)]
*  ethics problem, but this ranks right up there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  That said, with this particular former president, this was like the 489th most serious scandal [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  associated with him and so it instantly became totally obscure trivia basically as soon as [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  it happened. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  But it happened. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  Mary Ann Trump Berry passed away last night at home in New York City. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  She was 86 years old. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=195.96s)]
*  And I tell that story in part because I think there is an important point here that relates [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=199.76s)]
*  in some ways to today's news and it's the point about an institution, in this case an [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=206.6s)]
*  institution like the court, policing itself. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  There was no criminal case that was ever brought based on the Trump Organization alleged [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=218.52s)]
*  fraud that was described by the New York Times in that series back in 2019. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=222.8s)]
*  And no, I don't know why that is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't know why that was never the basis of a prosecution of Trump or his family members [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  or his business. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  But whether or not there were ever going to be criminal charges brought against Judge [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=233.96s)]
*  Berry or former President Trump or anyone else involved in that alleged fraud, still [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  you had this institution. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=243.88s)]
*  You had the judiciary. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=246.0s)]
*  You had the court itself where Judge Berry worked starting an investigation into the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=247.72s)]
*  matter. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=253.48s)]
*  And that investigation, depending on how it went, could very well have resulted in her [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=254.8s)]
*  being censured as a judge or reprimanded or even impeached and removed off the bench. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=258.48s)]
*  And the reason that sort of sword of Damocles was hanging over her and that forced her into [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=265.0s)]
*  an unexpected retirement as a judge is because that institution decided to police itself. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=270.6s)]
*  The judiciary has an interest as an institution in policing itself and maintaining its own [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=276.6s)]
*  standards in policing its own members to make sure they stand up to the values that are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=281.8s)]
*  professed by that institution. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=287.16s)]
*  And that dynamic, institutions policing themselves, upholding their values as institutions, policing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=289.44s)]
*  their own members, holding their own representatives accountable for violation of the rules and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=297.12s)]
*  the ethos of those organizations, regardless of the legal issues, regardless of the criminal [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=304.24s)]
*  law, that institutional self policing is a really important thing in our country and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  in every other. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaNM38lIg7Y&t=313.44s)]
