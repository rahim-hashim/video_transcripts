# A real variable we've not seen before: Hamas hostage-taking complicates response to attacks
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o)
*  This is, as you say, Ben, this is the—I think you said this is the Fourth Gaza War [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=0.0s)]
*  that you have lived through. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=4.36s)]
*  This one is different from all other previous conflicts because of this mass hostage-taking [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=6.44s)]
*  strategy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  And obviously, that—the cruelty and terrorizing of the individual people who are victimized [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=13.64s)]
*  by this tactic is one outcome. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=21.2s)]
*  It also has an outcome. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=24.6s)]
*  You see them prioritizing the photographing and filming of both murders and hostage-taking, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=26.16s)]
*  kidnappings to try to spread the terrorizing effect of that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=32.0s)]
*  Presumably, the hostage-taking also has the strategic impact, the tactical impact of providing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=36.96s)]
*  some sort of a human shield factor for Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=44.8s)]
*  They're threatening that they'll kill hostages and film it and broadcast it in response to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=48.32s)]
*  Israel destroying any civilian homes in Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=54.24s)]
*  Obviously, it's hard to know why exactly they are doing it or how they see it ending. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  But how does it constrain or prescribe what the American government can do to know that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=65.16s)]
*  there are dozens, maybe even more, hostages taken and that there are Americans among them? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, there's some practical questions that I'm sure are front of mind [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  in the Situation Room. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=81.88s)]
*  I can imagine that this is kind of an open-ended meeting in the Situation Room. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=82.88s)]
*  And one of those questions is, what intelligence support can we provide to Israel to try to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=87.32s)]
*  identify who the hostages are and what their locations are? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=92.32s)]
*  And obviously, another concern of the United States is trying to determine how many of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=96.28s)]
*  these people are Americans. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=101.12s)]
*  I think the question going forward is, Hamas wants these hostages for a number of reasons, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=102.88s)]
*  perhaps to be human shields against indiscriminate bombardment or ground invasion of Gaza, perhaps [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  to exchange those hostages for Palestinians who are in prison. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  I think a big part of the reason why Hamas probably did this, and nobody knows exactly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=120.28s)]
*  why they did this, is that they want to establish themselves as the vanguard of Palestinian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=124.42s)]
*  leadership. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=129.16s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority is weak. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=130.16s)]
*  They're not delivering on the aspiration of Palestinian state. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=131.56s)]
*  They are kind of a corrupt and sclerotic government. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=135.32s)]
*  And Hamas wants to demonstrate that they can achieve things like the release of Palestinian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  prisoners that the Palestinian Authority cannot. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  And that presents a real dilemma for Israel, which is, do you deal with Hamas in some form [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=146.88s)]
*  of prisoner exchange, like the one that Qatar is apparently offering, or do you not? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=151.88s)]
*  The problem is, if you don't, you have no way of assuring the safety of those hostages. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  It feels like Israel is primed for a ground invasion of Gaza, which would lead to a significant [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=163.28s)]
*  loss of life for civilians there and probably significant dangers for the hostages. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=169.36s)]
*  Even what was announced today, the cutoff of electricity and food and water to Gaza, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=174.08s)]
*  well, that could put at risk the hostages themselves. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=177.8s)]
*  That could cut off power for hospitals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  That cut off access to water. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=182.8s)]
*  And so we have a real variable here that we've not seen before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=185.04s)]
*  We had one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shaleed, taken hostage by Hamas in the past. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=188.46s)]
*  He ended up being traded for a thousand prisoners. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=194.06s)]
*  And so that's the length that Israel's gone to get its people back. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  I think in this case, its desire for retribution, its desire to destroy Hamas, is actually kind [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=200.58s)]
*  of at odds with the capacity to assure that you can get the hostages back safely. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=207.66s)]
*  So that's a real dilemma that is facing people in Israel and the United States right now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=214.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=218.44s)]
*  It's a real dilemma that becomes more acute and more of a moral catastrophe with literally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=219.44s)]
*  each passing minute that those people are in that situation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=223.44s)]
*  Ben Rhodes, former White House Deputy National Security Advisor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=228.64s)]
*  Ben, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=231.16s)]
*  Really helpful. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=232.6s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km5qQxNWs2o&t=233.6s)]
