# With Businesses Failing, Trump Taps His Political Supporters To Maintain His Wealth
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg)
*  If you're a soccer fan, maybe even if you're not, you probably recognize this guy, Cristiano Ronaldo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=0.0s)]
*  Widely considered to be one of the greatest players in soccer history and currently among the highest paid athletes in the entire world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=6.48s)]
*  Which is why Cristiano Ronaldo turned a few heads in the world of New York real estate this week when he sold his apartment in Trump Tower for less than half of what he paid for it in 2015. Half. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=14.92s)]
*  Now, it's not like Ronaldo was hurting for cash. This is the kind of thing an uber rich person does only when looking to get out of a bad investment before it gets worse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=29.32s)]
*  And Cristiano Ronaldo is not the only one fleeing Trump Tower. Back in September, the luxury skyscraper was put on a financial watch list by Wells Fargo due to Trump Tower's rapidly declining occupancy rates. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=40.76s)]
*  So, Ronaldo may be part of an elite exodus, but there is one tenant who does not appear to be leaving Trump Tower anytime soon. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  The Washington Post reported last year that Donald Trump's political action committee is aligning the ex president's pockets by spending over $37,000 a month to rent office space in Trump Tower, office space that sits empty. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  But Trump may have good reason to be funneling campaign donations and to the struggling gem of his real estate empire. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=79.84s)]
*  That's because Trump's $100 million loan on Trump Tower comes due in September. Tick tock. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=85.92s)]
*  He also owes $590 million in loans that will come due within the next four years, more than half of which Donald Trump has personally guaranteed, meaning he is on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars if those loans aren't paid. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=93.56s)]
*  That could be a significant problem for the former president now that his longtime accounting firm, Mazar's, has essentially warned the world against lending money to Trump, saying the 10 years of financial statements they prepared for him for from him cannot be relied upon. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=108.24s)]
*  So what does this all mean for the immediate future of Donald J. Trump and his business? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=124.88s)]
*  Joining us now is David Fahrenheit, an investigative reporter now with the New York Times, who has done extensive reporting on Trump's finances and business dealings. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=131.84s)]
*  David, thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=139.84s)]
*  No problem. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=142.4s)]
*  So Trump's big loans start maturing this year. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=143.36s)]
*  We have September as our due date for Trump Tower. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=147.32s)]
*  How do you think the statement from Mazar's is going to affect his ability to handle those gigantic loans that are coming due? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=149.88s)]
*  Well, it certainly doesn't help. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=157.76s)]
*  As you said, Mazar's, this is Trump's longtime accounting firm. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  They know his finances better than anybody, and they're telling the world, look, we can't vouch for Trump anymore. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=163.44s)]
*  We can't vouch for the things he told us and the things we told other people on his behalf. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=168.6s)]
*  That's certainly bad if you're Donald Trump and you want to try to refinance those loans. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=172.88s)]
*  You want to try to find new lenders. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=176.88s)]
*  That said, Trump is moving out of the businesses he's been in, the golf course business, the real estate business, the hotel business, into a business, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=179.96s)]
*  the business of social media and SPACs on the stock market, basically monetizing politics. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=188.44s)]
*  So even if he's not a great credit risk in his old business, there's still a huge number of people who will give him money essentially for nothing because of political ties or political allegiance [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=193.8s)]
*  that he might be able to tap to pay off loans on his existing properties. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=203.96s)]
*  So you're convinced that the political capital, quite literally, could help float him through the next several years? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=208.04s)]
*  Sure. If you look at that social media, the Trump SPAC, this investment that's on the stock market, I mean, that has produced nothing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  It has nothing. It's got plans to produce a social media network at some point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=222.04s)]
*  But people are already willing to put billions of, or at least hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=225.92s)]
*  The stock price has gone through the roof. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  That shows you Trump can monetize his supporters in a way that can bring him in money even when he doesn't have a product. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=234.4s)]
*  So, yes, I think there is a ready source of cash for him to tap there that if he wants to, he could use to bail out some of the properties in from his old life. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  But I guess I wonder, you know, we have this, I think it's a civil deposition from the New York AG, Letitia James. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  Is that not going to affect his standing with creditors as more information comes out about how sort of financially reckless he's been, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  even if he has the political capital? Or do you think that people can separate those two things? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=261.88s)]
*  Well, it certainly won't help with his creditors. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=267.4s)]
*  But, you know, I do think that that deposition, those civil and criminal investigations that seem to be closing in on him are problems for him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=270.0s)]
*  But you have to remember this in some ways, this is a little bit like Trump's situation in Atlantic City when he ran into hard times in the early 2000s or in New York, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=277.56s)]
*  when he ran into hard times in the early 90s. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  He owes so much money to so many people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=287.8s)]
*  There's an incentive there where those lenders, the people who Trump owes money, don't want him to fail because then they get nothing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=291.32s)]
*  And so there's been a couple of times in Trump's life before when people have been willing to say, look, you know, he owes us a ton of money. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=298.68s)]
*  We're willing to cut that debt down, give him a break in hopes of getting something rather than getting nothing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  So he's pulled that card before. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=309.24s)]
*  And if things got really bad in his real estate empire, his banks might see that situation the same way, even though they might have a right to call on these loans or try to cancel them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  What's in it for them? They want money. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6pJFdEcwg&t=319.12s)]
