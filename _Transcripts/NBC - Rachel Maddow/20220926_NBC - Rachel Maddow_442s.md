# Republican Party's Failure To Manage Its Extremists Threatens U.S. Democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI)
*  Joining us now is my friend David Corn. He is the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=0.0s)]
*  He lately has been [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=4.0200000000000005s)]
*  Marinating in history to try to get us try to help us get our heads around our current moment [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=5.64s)]
*  His new excellent book is called American psychosis a historical investigation of how the Republican Party went crazy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  David Corn, thank you so much for writing this book and thank you for being here [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=17.76s)]
*  I'm sorry that I haven't been here enough to have you on right when it came out, but I'm really glad you could be here tonight [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=21.12s)]
*  Well, thanks a lot Rachel and I appreciate your respect for history [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=25.799999999999997s)]
*  We you know talking about what happened in Italy this you know this past few days over the hundred-year stretch [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=30.2s)]
*  You see the patterns you see what you call the rhymes of history and in doing this book American psychosis [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=36.56s)]
*  I saw the same thing in American history [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  We see patterns again and again that even we lived through that we don't recognize that you know the Republican Party [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=45.56s)]
*  And you know we're now having a debate about whether MAGA extremism is something akin to fascism [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=51.4s)]
*  But the Republican Party for 70 years keeps having this dance with extremism [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=57.4s)]
*  You know encouraging exploiting extremism. It's happened all the time what we see now [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=63.08s)]
*  Donald Trump and the Republican Party is not a case not a aberration [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=68.72s)]
*  It's a continuation and I was struck because I was you know reading up on the Italian [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=72.66s)]
*  Election earlier today, and there was an academic in Europe [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=78.36s)]
*  Who was talking about the history and he said what we're seeing in Italy is nothing new [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=82.68s)]
*  I mean you make that point quite quite obviously but even in the last 50 years the far-right has always been there [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Starting at the end of World War two and it has bubbled up and bubbled down [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=94.12s)]
*  bubbled up and bubbled down and now it's just emerging [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  But it's always been there the same way that I think we've always had a fringe far-right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Fanaticism here that the Republican Party has always tried to exploit to its own benefit whether it was McCarthyism the Burch's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=106.0s)]
*  white segregationists in this in the 60s and 70s and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=113.24s)]
*  Donald Trump just made it burst out and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=117.24s)]
*  It's interesting in Italy. You know they have a multiple party system [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=121.28s)]
*  So in Italy the the fringe elements the far-right the fascistic elements get their own parties in America [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=125.34s)]
*  Doesn't work that way we don't have multiple parties, but we have seen the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=132.2s)]
*  expansion of the influence of these extremists within the Republican Party the Republican Party [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Acting like a coalition in Europe taking them in to get power and juice to the extent that we even see [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=143.48s)]
*  Donald Trump in recent days [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  welcoming the QAnon movement into his [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=152.0s)]
*  Trumpist Republican Party the way that the majority or the close to majority coalition in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  Italy has taken in and has been led by the fascists [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=162.36s)]
*  David I was struck by the fact that you document over and over again these moments where what we consider to be the mainstream [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=166.8s)]
*  Republican Party has to confront [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  How much they want to be associated with people who they see and movements that they see as toxic [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Anti-democratic extreme and in most cases embarrassing you talk about that with the John Birch Society for example [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=184.0s)]
*  And elements of the Goldwater campaign and the conservative media around that time you talk about it with Dwight Eisenhower General Eisenhower [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  as President Eisenhower having to confront McCarthyism [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=198.0s)]
*  And the appeal of Joe McCarthy both at home in Wisconsin where he was an incredibly towering figure [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  But also in terms of the way he tapped into some real dangerous energy on the far-right and I [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=208.2s)]
*  Feel like you busted a bunch of myths in terms of these sort of self-serving histories [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=214.6s)]
*  Where we've sort of told orders told ourselves left right and center that the the Republican Party the mainstream Republican Party has effectively [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=219.44s)]
*  Policed to those extremes and kept them at bay [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  Until now and in fact I think tell me if I'm wrong [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=230.44s)]
*  But what I took from your book is that there are multiple instances in which the guys who we think of as the good guys or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=234.64s)]
*  At least the mainstream people actually chose deliberately [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  To keep cultivating those extremes to keep those you know the QAnon movements of their time [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  alive and agitating for the Republican cause [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=248.44s)]
*  You know [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  Again, the pattern is obvious once you go back and look there is not not a single major [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=253.16s)]
*  Republican president or presidential candidate who did not embrace extremism to some degree [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  It waxes and wanes that some do and some have done it more intensely than others [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=263.32s)]
*  But it's always in part of the Republican playbook a recent example that of course you're remembering most of our viewers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=267.68s)]
*  Well would be John Boehner [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  Embracing the Tea Party the Tea Party was an extremist movement that you know was arguing that Barack Obama [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=276.32s)]
*  Was a secret socialist Muslim born in Africa had a secret plan to destroy the American economy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=283.48s)]
*  So he could impose a totalitarian dictatorship [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=289.92s)]
*  I mean it's irrational the way McCarthyism was irrational and the way the QAnon is irrational and John Boehner Country Club Republican [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=292.68s)]
*  He knew that but he invited the Tea Party literally onto the steps of the Capitol for demonstrations brought him into the party [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=300.36s)]
*  Because they helped him get elected speaker. They then chased him out, but he validated and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=307.2s)]
*  Authenticated the Tea Party perspective and like you know McCarthyism the Burch's or you go over to the fascist of Europe [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=313.08s)]
*  There's a there's a core there and the element that I see [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=320.72s)]
*  Uniting all this is that they look at the other side their political enemies and they [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Demonize and dehumanize them. There's their subversive. They want to destroy their society the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=329.6s)]
*  McCarthyites believed there was a cabal that wanted to turn the US over to the Soviets and that was being run by people in the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=336.76s)]
*  US government I just described the Tea Party [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=343.64s)]
*  Conspiracy theory we know what the QAnon conspiracy theory is and if you listen to what Maloney is saying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  She's saying literally the other day. I saw her speech of hers. She says financial speculators [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't know what that's code for and woke activists want to steal our [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=358.72s)]
*  identity our identities as Italians Christians and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  Women and men and turn us into [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=367.36s)]
*  consumer slaves [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=370.12s)]
*  I mean that's very QAnon-ish in a way [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=371.6s)]
*  So it but it's all about challenging the other side not a matter of policy disputes or disagreeing on whether it's abortion or tax [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=374.6s)]
*  Policy but calling them subversives who want to destroy the country [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  We love take away our culture from us and the Republicans have played that game again and again and again [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=385.94s)]
*  And I'm sorry, you know, we can't both sides this there is no equivalent on the Democratic side [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=391.4s)]
*  This is an asymmetrical political [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  History and it's really I mean the book, you know describes this and I think it portrays the dark side of the GOP for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=400.44s)]
*  70 years that the party itself has not acknowledged and that history and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=407.52s)]
*  Journalists have often not paid as enough attention to as they should but now we see it in you know in full view [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  Because Donald Trump has made its center stage [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  You [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy1O_CZ2NNI&t=429.84s)]
