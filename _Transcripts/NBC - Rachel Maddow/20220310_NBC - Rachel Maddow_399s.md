# As Millions Flee Putin's War In Ukraine, Journalists Focus On The Individuals
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o)
*  Throughout this crisis the world has turned to journalists who live in Ukraine to get a firsthand perspective of what's happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=0.0s)]
*  One of these journalists is named Aliam Kent. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=6.44s)]
*  Aliam Kent was among the many people in Ukraine forced to flee the country for the refugee camps in neighboring Poland. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=9.84s)]
*  Since arriving in Poland, Aliam Kent and her reporting partner Romana Isabella have been documenting the experiences of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=16.84s)]
*  Ukrainian refugees for a video project called Diaries in Exile. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=24.0s)]
*  Their work puts a human face on the victims of this war by capturing not just their trials and hardship, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=29.32s)]
*  but also moments of laughter and levity experienced by real people keeping hope alive every day. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=35.2s)]
*  How did you get a piano here? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=41.96s)]
*  It's mine. I used to travel with this piano everywhere I go. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=43.96s)]
*  Wow, how do you travel with it? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=47.96s)]
*  Do you see a trailer over there? That's the piano. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=49.96s)]
*  Oh, my dear, my dear, my dear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=100.96s)]
*  Joining us now is Aliam Kent, a Ukraine-based journalist and producer of Diaries in Exile. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=113.96s)]
*  Aliam, thank you for being with us. You are seeing things I'm trying to capture. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=119.96s)]
*  You're doing it much better than I am, but you're capturing the humanity of these refugees. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=124.96s)]
*  You are taking them away from being an abstraction because when people hear, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=129.96s)]
*  a million and a half refugees or two million refugees, it's hard to understand that each one of these are individual lives lived. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=134.96s)]
*  Yes, thank you. That's exactly what we're trying to do with this series. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=144.96s)]
*  I want to ask you about some of the lighter moments. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=151.96s)]
*  There aren't really light moments in refugee sites, but one of the things you did happened during an interview [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=155.96s)]
*  with a 17-year-old boy from Odessa and your reaction. I just want to play that for our audience. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=160.96s)]
*  I'm at a train station, so I'm getting constant announcements like you can hear now about the next train coming in, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=185.96s)]
*  but you got an announcement about who lost their babushka. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=190.96s)]
*  There is some strength in the human spirit in which people laugh, they tell jokes, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=194.96s)]
*  they are trying to grab some little piece of life to continue on even in this horrible situation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=200.96s)]
*  Yes, 100 percent. While Romana and I are running around trying to capture these human moments, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=207.96s)]
*  we find pain that we share alongside with these people. We find humor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=213.96s)]
*  I'd say that that's how this war is also being perceived. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=219.96s)]
*  I mean, my friends and I were reading the news constantly, but we're also sharing memes with each other. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=222.96s)]
*  It's a very Ukrainian way. I'd say that's how we're doing it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=226.96s)]
*  Every last person I talk to ends when they talk to me in an interview with the expression, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=230.96s)]
*  glory to Ukraine, Slavo-Ukraine. They all talk about the fact that they are going home, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=235.96s)]
*  not that they hope they're going home. What is it about the Ukrainian spirit [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=241.96s)]
*  that is allowing the people to stay in their homes and to be able to do that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=245.96s)]
*  I think that's a very important question. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=250.96s)]
*  I think that's just who Ukrainians are at their core. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=253.96s)]
*  The rest of the world is really meeting the people for the first time, for many. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  And that is one of the regular themes, I would say, from all the people we have spoken to. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  They have indeed said that they're all planning on returning home. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's just how we're doing it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  I think that's just how we're doing it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  The regular themes, I would say, from all the people we have spoken to, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=276.96s)]
*  they have indeed said that they're all planning on returning home. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=280.96s)]
*  When asking what's next, it's a very scary question. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=284.96s)]
*  Many people are lost. They don't know what's going to happen next. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=287.96s)]
*  But the one thing they have in mind is going back and rebuilding their country on their own. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=290.96s)]
*  And that really tells the spirit and the belief that the people have in themselves and their country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=295.96s)]
*  And it's why many haven't lost hope. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=300.96s)]
*  Tell me what you want Western audiences to understand. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=304.96s)]
*  It becomes very hard when we report, as I say, on these mass numbers and these people who are going out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=308.96s)]
*  What do you want people to understand about Ukrainians through the work that you're doing? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=315.96s)]
*  I want people to understand that Ukrainians are just like anybody else, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=321.96s)]
*  but they are their own very unique individual people. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=327.96s)]
*  They're different from Russians, even though they're Russian speaking Ukrainians. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=331.96s)]
*  They're different from the people in the countries that they border, which are EU countries. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=336.96s)]
*  And they're trying to progress towards a society. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=341.96s)]
*  So it's a constantly changing culture, constantly changing country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=346.96s)]
*  And they're being attacked for their beliefs of freedom and democracy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=350.96s)]
*  So that's really who they are as people. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=355.96s)]
*  I'd say that's why you're how they're reacting now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=359.96s)]
*  So I'd hope that people are inspired, meeting the people and continue to support. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=362.96s)]
*  Aliam Kent is a journalist and producer of Diaries in Exile, which you can find on YouTube starting today. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=370.96s)]
*  Aliam, thank you for your time tonight and for this project. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=375.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY5QwO0Tr5o&t=389.96s)]
