# Public Service Agencies, Large And Small, Chilled By Violent Threats From Trump Supporters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ)
*  The Washington Post reports, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  since the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's home [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=1.6400000000000001s)]
*  to recover classified documents, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=4.64s)]
*  the National Archives has become the target [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=6.44s)]
*  of a rash of threats and vitriol. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=8.16s)]
*  Trump's recent actions have whipped his followers [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=11.44s)]
*  into a fervor against the National Archives. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=14.16s)]
*  How can you be in a fervor against the National Archives? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=19.52s)]
*  I mean, even in that ridiculous movie, National Treasure, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=23.64s)]
*  where the most insane things are made to seem [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=27.84s)]
*  super suspicious and sinister, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=30.48s)]
*  ooh, the clues are on the dollar bill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=32.52s)]
*  I mean, even there, the National Archives itself isn't bad. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=34.88s)]
*  I mean, the National Archives [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=39.2s)]
*  is where we keep our country's documents. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=41.2s)]
*  It's the filing cabinet. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=44.0s)]
*  It's the library. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=46.68s)]
*  How can you be mad at the library? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=48.08s)]
*  Oh, wait. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's what we're doing now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=53.68s)]
*  Hysterical criticism and culture war, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=56.48s)]
*  culture war posturing from the political right [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=59.16s)]
*  really is shutting down American libraries now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=62.08s)]
*  And children's story times at libraries [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=66.08s)]
*  are being targeted for violence [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=69.08s)]
*  and intimidation from the right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  And school board meetings are turning into scenes [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=72.4s)]
*  of violence and intimidation and harassment as well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=74.64s)]
*  And elections workers are being threatened [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=77.6s)]
*  and attacked and doxxed and harassed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=80.08s)]
*  And public health officials [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=84.04s)]
*  and local public health officers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=85.84s)]
*  and doctors and nurses and teachers, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=87.8s)]
*  I mean, depending on whatever the hot topic of this week [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=90.24s)]
*  is on the right, some new group of Americans [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=92.72s)]
*  working in some aspect of public service [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=96.4s)]
*  is about to start getting threatened [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=99.32s)]
*  and doxxed and harassed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=101.32s)]
*  I mean, it's everything that we cover now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=103.4s)]
*  We just had that interview last week [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=105.32s)]
*  with Dr. Anthony Fauci on the occasion [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=107.04s)]
*  of him announcing his retirement [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=108.6s)]
*  after serving seven different presidencies, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=109.88s)]
*  nearly 50 years in public health public service. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=112.52s)]
*  Dr. Fauci never before now had to have a security detail. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=115.32s)]
*  He has to now because of all the threats [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  to him and his family. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=122.08s)]
*  But below a sort of national figure like that, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=125.0s)]
*  public health officials, local, city, county, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=127.44s)]
*  state public health officials all over the country [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=130.8s)]
*  hounded out of their jobs, threatened, harassed, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=132.96s)]
*  causing the largest public health professional exodus [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  in modern American history [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=138.4s)]
*  in the middle of our largest public health threat [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=140.12s)]
*  in a century. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=142.08s)]
*  The whole elections office in one Texas County, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  Gillespie County, the whole office, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  every worker in the elections office, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=149.36s)]
*  all resigning this month en masse [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=151.36s)]
*  because they can't handle the threats [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=153.52s)]
*  and the harassment of them for their terrible crime [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  of working like normal public servants [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=159.72000000000003s)]
*  to administer totally normal elections. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=161.68s)]
*  Former President Trump's social media company [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  posting a link to the unredacted search warrant [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  for Mar-a-Lago, unredacted in the sense [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=170.4s)]
*  that the one that they posted didn't black out [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  the names of the individual FBI agents [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  who signed off on some of that documentation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  After that, a Trump White House staffer [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=181.16s)]
*  posted personal identifying information [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=183.08s)]
*  for those FBI agents and their families. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=185.56s)]
*  So Trump supporters could hound them and threaten them [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=187.88s)]
*  and intimidate them and target them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=190.12s)]
*  The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=193.72s)]
*  having to send out a nationwide alert [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=195.56s)]
*  about a spike in threats to federal law enforcement [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=198.12s)]
*  officials of all kinds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=200.44s)]
*  The judge who signed off on the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=202.12s)]
*  needing security after his address was posted online [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  and Trump supporters started threatening him [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=207.96s)]
*  and threatening his synagogue, that's nice. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=209.72s)]
*  Now apparently it's the National Archives staff. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=213.72s)]
*  The National Archives, I mean, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=216.8s)]
*  talk about the case that proves the point, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=221.0s)]
*  I mean, if the federal government were a zoo, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=222.8s)]
*  the National Archives would be like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  the Lapeyre Bunnies exhibit, you know, the baby otters, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=226.84s)]
*  the cute little vegetarian monkeys that are so small, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=229.68s)]
*  they can sit in a teaspoon. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=231.72s)]
*  I mean, it's just not possible to object violently [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=233.04s)]
*  to the National Archives on any rational basis. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, even if you want to make the National Archives [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  a pulse-pounding source of great excitement, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=243.28s)]
*  it's gonna cost you $100 million to make that movie [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=246.08s)]
*  and it's going to require Nicolas Cage [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=248.56s)]
*  and it's still going to be too ridiculous [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=250.44s)]
*  to take seriously even for a second. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=252.04s)]
*  But in this political environment on the right, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=257.11999999999995s)]
*  they can generate a murderous rage [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=259.0s)]
*  about the National Archives apparently, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  or the FBI, or school boards, or librarians, or teachers, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=264.84s)]
*  or doctors, or county public health boards, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=269.2s)]
*  or the little old ladies who work at the polls [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  on election day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=273.76s)]
*  No one's beyond being threatened, doxed, harassed, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=276.64s)]
*  intimidated, driven out of public service [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=280.0s)]
*  if they can make you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=281.96s)]
*  It is hard to stay a democracy, just at a practical level, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  it is hard to stay a democracy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=287.64s)]
*  when all forms of public service, large and small, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  all jobs in the public life of our democracy [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  come with threats of violence. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=295.68s)]
*  You can't long hold free and fair elections [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=299.79999999999995s)]
*  when it takes bravery to be a poll worker. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=304.2s)]
*  It should not take bravery to be a poll worker [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=307.76s)]
*  or a file clerk at the archives [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=311.12s)]
*  or an immunologist. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=314.36s)]
*  The threat of political violence [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=316.88s)]
*  takes normal people out of public life, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=318.44s)]
*  which puts you on a very fast track [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=321.16s)]
*  to the end of democracy at a very practical level. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=323.12s)]
*  The news today has been dominated by [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=329.44s)]
*  one of the former president's allies in the US Senate [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=333.28s)]
*  promising that if Trump is indicted for these crimes [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=335.8s)]
*  he's being investigated for, there will be, in his words, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=338.28s)]
*  riots in the street. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=341.12s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham is promising that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=343.44s)]
*  He's not speaking out against it, saying, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=347.44s)]
*  I hope this doesn't happen [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=349.16s)]
*  and I need to tell my fellow Americans [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=350.4s)]
*  that this is wrong, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=352.08s)]
*  I can sense this might be coming and it's wrong. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=352.92s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=354.88s)]
*  He's just basically promising that's gonna happen [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=355.76s)]
*  and wielding that as a threat [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP0E7PVfGmQ&t=359.0s)]
