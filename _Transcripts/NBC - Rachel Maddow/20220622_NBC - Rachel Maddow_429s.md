# Pfizer To Donate All Profits From Business In Russia To Ukrainian Aid
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k)
*  We've secured enough doses and we're launching a comprehensive effort with states, local [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=0.0s)]
*  health departments, pediatricians, family doctors, pharmacies, rural health clinics, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=6.24s)]
*  community health centers, and other trusted messengers and partners to get the word out, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=11.52s)]
*  to get help, to get shots in arms. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=17.12s)]
*  Ten minutes before the top of the hour, President Biden speaking yesterday at the White House [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=20.64s)]
*  on the CDC's approval of COVID vaccines for kids under five years old. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=24.54s)]
*  Earlier, the president and first lady visited a COVID vaccination clinic in Washington, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=30.7s)]
*  D.C. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=36.06s)]
*  Joining us now is the chairman and CEO of Pfizer, Albert Borla. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=37.18s)]
*  And we'll talk about the vaccine for children under five in just a moment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=42.14s)]
*  But first, you're here to make somewhat of a special announcement. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=46.3s)]
*  You know, when the war in Ukraine began, when Russia's invasion began, a lot of companies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=50.54s)]
*  pulled their business out of Russia. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=56.7s)]
*  Healthcare companies still wanted to deliver healthcare to Russian, whether it's a Russian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=60.06s)]
*  child that has cancer is no different than a child anywhere else. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=66.02s)]
*  And Pfizer continued to serve the people of Russia. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=70.58s)]
*  But you're here to announce sort of a move that really balances the work that you're [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=75.1s)]
*  doing in Russia with what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=81.38s)]
*  Can you tell us about it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=84.78s)]
*  Of course, Mika, thank you very much for having me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=85.78s)]
*  And you know, always for humanitarian reasons, medicines are excluded for all types of sciences. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  And rightly so, because it's not the same to stop sending cars or computers or telephones [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=95.58s)]
*  and then stop sending medicines for leukemia in children, for example. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=102.89999999999999s)]
*  But we didn't want to use this as an excuse to do business as usual in Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  So we decided that we will continue sending our medicines to those kids and patients that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=111.14s)]
*  they were unfortunate to be born maybe the wrong time in the wrong place. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=115.5s)]
*  But we will not profit from it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=119.74s)]
*  So all our profits from the Russian subsidiary are going to be donated to humanitarian causes [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  directly in Ukraine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=129.06s)]
*  So today we are announcing that the first installment of this for the year, five million [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=131.06s)]
*  dollars, will be given to aid humanitarian organizations in Ukraine, including Red Cross [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=136.9s)]
*  of Ukraine, UNICEF of Ukraine, and etc. etc. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=142.86s)]
*  So tell us what was behind this decision, this sort of unusual sort of serving serving [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=147.02s)]
*  in terms of medical needs, but then again, supporting Ukrainians against the Russians. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=155.38s)]
*  Our main purpose, it is breakers that change patients lives. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=162.3s)]
*  You can't differentiate if this patient was born in Russia or Ukraine or Iraq or North [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=165.74s)]
*  Korea for that purpose. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=171.62s)]
*  But what we can do it is not continue doing business as usual. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=173.82s)]
*  So we can achieve both. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=178.0s)]
*  Not only we can save lives of kids that they had nothing to do with what is happening, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=180.12s)]
*  but also help use all these profits to save lives of kids that also had nothing to do [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=185.72s)]
*  that were born in Ukraine and they're suffering the Russian aggression. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=191.06s)]
*  Dr. Borlaz, Walter Isaacson, good to talk to you again. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=194.56s)]
*  Your company with your partner BioNTech and Moderna, the other company, have both pioneered [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=199.22s)]
*  the use of messenger RNA, which can easily be reprogrammed every time the spike protein [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=204.88s)]
*  of a coronavirus evolves or changes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=211.2s)]
*  Do you think we're going to get updated mRNA vaccines every season that will be directed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=214.96s)]
*  to each new variation of the coronavirus and will we have to take those shots every year? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=221.92s)]
*  I'm almost certain about it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=227.92s)]
*  I say almost certain because, of course, regulators have the final say in all of that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=229.72s)]
*  But that's the beauty of mRNA. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=234.14s)]
*  You can adopt your vaccine just by changing the sequencing, which is a very minor change, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=236.5s)]
*  either manufacturing or in the properties of the vaccine, safety or efficacy, but can [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=242.1s)]
*  make a huge difference in the way that responds to the virus. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  So for this reason, I'm very confident that we'll be able to respond very, very fast to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=249.0s)]
*  every new variant. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=254.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=255.14s)]
*  Let's turn to Mike Barnacle, who had a question yesterday about the COVID vaccine that he [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=256.14s)]
*  couldn't get an answer to. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=260.98s)]
*  So we saved it for today, Mike. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=262.34000000000003s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=265.02s)]
*  Dr. Borla, the question that I was seeking an answer to is pretty simple. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=266.02s)]
*  The vaccines for children five and younger, is the composition of that vaccine different [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=270.62s)]
*  than the Pfizer vaccine for adults? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=277.14s)]
*  The composition is not different, but the dosage is very, very different. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=280.8s)]
*  The kids are getting one tenth of the dose that an adult will get. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=286.0s)]
*  One tenth, I repeat. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=291.12s)]
*  That's in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, of course. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=292.2s)]
*  So it's three micrograms instead of 30 that the adults are getting. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=295.28s)]
*  And we were able to be able to demonstrate that with this very minimal dose, we are having [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=299.8s)]
*  very good tolerability profiles. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=305.72s)]
*  So we are minimizing fevers or other reactions that vaccines can create to kids. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=307.72s)]
*  We create very minimal this type of reaction. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=315.36s)]
*  And at the same time, we are giving very, very good protection. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=317.44s)]
*  Dr. Borla, obviously the Omicron and its various variants have become the dominant strains [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  of COVID over the last handful of months. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=327.76s)]
*  It looks to continue that way, at least for now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=330.64s)]
*  Give us an update, if you will, about Omicron specific vaccines. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=333.04s)]
*  Is that what we're going to see going forward? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=336.6s)]
*  And how are you trying to stay one step ahead of a virus that is mutating constantly? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=339.66s)]
*  We are going to see Omicron specific vaccines. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=345.68s)]
*  The FDA has called the major committee of experts for a meeting on this month, June [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=347.88s)]
*  28. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=354.88s)]
*  Those experts, together with FDA, we will also present our positions over there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=355.88s)]
*  They will make some decisions as to what they think is the best for public health to see [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=360.2s)]
*  in the next vaccines. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=366.56s)]
*  Whatever the decisions that we'll make or whatever the possible, I think, options that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=369.08s)]
*  they're going to elaborate, we are ready for them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=372.52s)]
*  We have developed monovalent vaccines and multivalent vaccines in higher doses, lower [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  doses, and they are all waiting so that we can hear what they think is the best way to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=380.08s)]
*  forward so that we can provide the vaccine that it is way better than the current one. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=387.44s)]
*  Pfizer CEO Albert Borla, thank you very much again, Pfizer, announcing right here on Morning [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=393.12s)]
*  Joe that they will donate all of the profits they make in Russia to Ukrainian relief efforts. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=399.44s)]
*  Sir, thank you very much for being on the show with us this morning. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9Me9Oc78k&t=405.96s)]
