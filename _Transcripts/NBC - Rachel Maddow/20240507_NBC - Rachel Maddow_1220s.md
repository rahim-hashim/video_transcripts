# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo)
*  The rule of law is mortal, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=0.0s)]
*  It can be killed. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=3.2s)]
*  It is wounded when the people involved in the judicial system [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=5.2s)]
*  and the adjudication of alleged crimes are being threatened [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=8.72s)]
*  and harassed and intimidated and pressured out of their jobs [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=11.72s)]
*  for doing that work. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=14.24s)]
*  Today, Justice Juan Marchand in New York said, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=16.36s)]
*  jail is what is coming next if Trump continues [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  to disobey court orders. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=22.6s)]
*  And do you think he's going to continue to disobey [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=25.32s)]
*  these court orders? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=27.2s)]
*  Justice Marchand today said, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=29.88s)]
*  I worry about the people who would have to execute that sanction, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=32.32s)]
*  the court officers, the correction officers, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=36.24s)]
*  the Secret Service detail, among others. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=38.4s)]
*  I worry about them and about what would go into executing such a sanction. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Of course, I'm also aware of the broader implications of such a sanction. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=44.44s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I have a job to do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=48.16s)]
*  Your continued violations of this court's lawful order [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=51.0s)]
*  threaten to interfere with the administration of justice. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=54.04s)]
*  Constant attacks which constitute a direct attack on the rule of law, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=56.6s)]
*  I cannot allow that to continue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=60.0s)]
*  As much as I don't want to impose a jail sanction [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=61.88s)]
*  and I've done everything I can to avoid doing so, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=64.56s)]
*  I want you to understand that I will. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=67.2s)]
*  I will do it if I have to. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=70.64s)]
*  Your direct attack on the rule of law cannot be allowed to continue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=72.4s)]
*  Just a signal moment in American history today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's sort of clearer to me on this day, at this moment, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=80.92s)]
*  than it's ever been in my lifetime, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=86.32s)]
*  that the rule of law isn't just a bumper sticker, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  It isn't an abstract thing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=93.24s)]
*  It doesn't float in like a miasma and suffuse the atmosphere. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=94.88s)]
*  The rule of law is specific stuff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=99.08s)]
*  In a day to day way, it means, for example, that court orders must be obeyed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=101.44s)]
*  And if you don't obey them, the court will punish you for that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  It means, for another example, that people who are part of the judicial system, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=108.44s)]
*  judges, court personnel, juries, witnesses, defense lawyers, prosecutors, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  it means they're also able to do their work [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  without being threatened or intimidated or being harassed or fired [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  by people who are associated with the accused. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=125.2s)]
*  That's law and order, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=127.92s)]
*  That's the rule of law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=129.52s)]
*  That's a nuts and bolts concrete thing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=130.56s)]
*  And it is under intense, incredible pressure. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=133.6s)]
*  It is having trouble right now in our country [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=136.52s)]
*  because as the judge in Trump's first criminal trial [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=139.32s)]
*  is trying to stand up for the rule of law today, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=142.76s)]
*  as he said in this warning to Trump, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=145.48s)]
*  This cross the Rubicon moment in court today where he'd warned Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=148.04s)]
*  he really is making plans to jail him if he keeps violating the court's order. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=151.28s)]
*  While that is happening, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=156.12s)]
*  simultaneously, the Republican controlled Senate in the state of Georgia [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  is moving forward on what appears to be their plans to subpoena the prosecutor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=164.0s)]
*  who's leading the criminal case against Trump in the state of Georgia. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  District Attorney Fannie Willis is leading that prosecution. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=171.48s)]
*  As soon as she opened that investigation, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=174.96s)]
*  the Republican-led legislature in Georgia started moving to try to curtail her authority, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=177.24s)]
*  to give themselves the ability to fire her as a prosecutor. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=182.72s)]
*  That process has been weaving and wending through legal obstacles for months now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=187.12s)]
*  But now they are planning to haul the prosecutor, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=192.72s)]
*  to haul Fannie Willis into the state Senate and force her to turn over evidence [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=196.0s)]
*  and testify herself under oath while she continues to try to lead that prosecution. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=200.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, simultaneously on Capitol Hill, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=207.52s)]
*  we've now got the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=210.32s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan, launching apparently some kind of new investigation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=213.0s)]
*  into one of the assistant district attorneys who is in court today [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=217.52s)]
*  leading the prosecution of Trump in his New York case. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=221.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, simultaneously, this weekend, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=225.2s)]
*  the former president hosted a high-dollar fundraiser at his home in Florida, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  in which he unbidden brought up the federal prosecutor [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=231.92s)]
*  who's overseeing his classified documents, Espionage Act prosecution in Florida, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  and also his overthrow the government case in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  According to a recording of those proceedings reviewed by NBC News, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=245.2s)]
*  Trump said at this fundraiser, quote, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=249.16s)]
*  Take a look at the deranged. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=257.8s)]
*  And he's perfect because you look at him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not attractive, both inside and out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=263.0s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't get a better guy if you're trying to make the devil that deranged. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=265.52s)]
*  Yes, this is one unattractive dude. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=270.12s)]
*  That's why, and the former president reportedly said, fricking expletive. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=272.68s)]
*  So that was Saturday afternoon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=282.36s)]
*  That was not long after he had posted this in all caps online on his social media company, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=283.68s)]
*  quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=288.88s)]
*  Again, the rule of law is not an abstract feeling or sense of being. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=294.92s)]
*  It's not something you just proclaim to be true and then set it and forget it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=299.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=304.08s)]
*  Terrorizing judges and juries and witnesses and prosecutors [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=304.64s)]
*  is something that breaks the rule of law. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  If those people are intimidated and harassed and threatened, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=312.24s)]
*  the rule of law has been broken. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  This past Friday, California man was criminally charged with making death threats [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=319.48s)]
*  against Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=323.48s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a man in New York was charged with threatening New York's attorney general, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=326.32s)]
*  Tish James, and Judge Arthur Engoran, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=330.04s)]
*  who was overseeing the civil case brought against Trump's business by New York attorney general Tish James. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  In February, a woman from Texas was sentenced to three years in prison [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=338.0s)]
*  for threatening the judge overseeing Trump's classified documents case in Florida. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=341.72s)]
*  Not long before that, a different Texas woman was charged with threatening the judge [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=346.0s)]
*  who's overseeing Trump's other federal criminal case, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=349.88000000000005s)]
*  the overthrow of the government case in federal court in Washington. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=352.24s)]
*  Not long before that, the FBI fatally shot a man [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=355.36s)]
*  who had threatened to kill the New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=359.12s)]
*  who has brought the case that's currently being argued in criminal court in New York. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=362.68s)]
*  This stuff has consequences and this stuff is consequences. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=368.6s)]
*  We are not looking at some vague future threat to the rule of law. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=373.56s)]
*  What you're seeing here is actively and currently damaging the rule of law right now [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=379.08s)]
*  because people are intimidated and terrorized. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=384.72s)]
*  People who work in the legal system as these alleged crimes are adjudicated there are being harassed, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=387.4s)]
*  threatened with firing, and intimidated and threatened. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=392.68s)]
*  And it is happening in all the criminal cases that surround Trump. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=399.48s)]
*  You might remember this lead in a recent special report from Reuters, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=403.48s)]
*  quote, District Judge Royce Lamberth has been threatened by angry criminals, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=408.32s)]
*  drug cartels, even Al Qaeda. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=414.08s)]
*  But nothing, Lamberth says, prepared him for the wave of harassment [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=417.04s)]
*  after he began hearing cases against supporters of former President Donald Trump, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=420.24s)]
*  who attacked the U.S. Capitol in a bid to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=424.04s)]
*  Lamberth, who was appointed to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=427.68s)]
*  was painted by right wing websites as part of a deep state conspiracy to destroy Trump and his followers. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=431.08s)]
*  Calls for his execution cropped up on pro-Trump websites, quote, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=436.84000000000003s)]
*  Traders get ropes, said one. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=440.8s)]
*  After he issued a prison sentence to one Idaho woman who pled guilty to joining the January 6th riot, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=444.0s)]
*  Lamberth's chambers voicemail filled with death threats. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=449.2s)]
*  One man found Lamberth's home phone number and called repeatedly with graphic vows to murder him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=454.44s)]
*  Lamberth told Reuters, quote, I could not believe how many death threats I got. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  This is, again, not some future potential threat to the rule of law. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=468.96s)]
*  This is damage to the rule of law, and it is here already. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=473.84s)]
*  When participating in the adjudication of alleged crimes by a political figure and his followers bring you death threats, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=478.32s)]
*  the rule of law has been bent. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  The rule of law has been broken. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  Those harms to the rule of law, that damage to the rule of law has been inflicted already. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=493.96s)]
*  The prospect of jail for the Republican Party's active presidential nominee, that is here already. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  He got his face-to-face warning in court today in New York. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  One more violation of the court's order, banning him from speaking about the jury or witnesses in his case, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  and he will be put in jail with Secret Service detail. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=515.24s)]
*  That time is now here, which means we are about to find out what it's like to be a country that has a presidential candidate [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=519.04s)]
*  and former president in jail because he refuses to follow court orders. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=526.36s)]
*  It's not a thought experiment anymore. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=530.52s)]
*  It's not the future. It is here. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=532.32s)]
*  Are we ready? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=533.92s)]
*  And so what do we do about that? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=537.28s)]
*  One way to start dealing with that is to stop pretending that it's not happening. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=540.96s)]
*  Threats to the rule of law are not a theoretical prospect looming sometime in the future. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=545.44s)]
*  They are here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=549.88s)]
*  Prosecutors and judges and jurors and witnesses need defending right now, right now, because they're being threatened right now. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=550.92s)]
*  Who, for example, who is defending Fannie Willis in Georgia right now? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=561.52s)]
*  The Republican-led legislature in Georgia is trying to destroy her and remove her in order to stop her from prosecuting the alleged [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  crimes of former President Donald Trump. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=576.76s)]
*  Who is defending her? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=579.36s)]
*  As the rule of law has bent and been broken by Trump and his movement, we've also seen the Democratic system bend and get [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=582.76s)]
*  broken by Trump and his movement. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=590.8s)]
*  Obviously, we did not have a peaceful transfer of power the last time he competed in and lost an election. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  There is no commitment at all, no expectation at all by anyone that he and his followers will allow for a peaceful transfer of power [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  this next time. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=608.04s)]
*  If he loses this next election as well. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  He's not even giving lip service to the idea that they will allow for a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=614.6s)]
*  He won't even say it and not mean it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=619.64s)]
*  And even more importantly than that, just coming out of his face in his Republican Party, accepting that his followers will not [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=623.52s)]
*  abide the results of the next election. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=633.48s)]
*  And neither will the Republican Party in all of its power, in all of its resources, accepting that is now the price of admission to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=637.16s)]
*  power in that party. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=643.52s)]
*  In March of this year, the Republican National Committee hired two new lawyers to oversee the party's election year legal efforts. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=645.56s)]
*  Now, just just two months after that, of those two lawyers, one of them has been indicted for helping in the effort to keep him in [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  power illegally after he lost the last election. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=660.4s)]
*  And the second one of those two lawyers has just been pushed out of his job at the RNC, reportedly because he's not willing to do the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=663.24s)]
*  same thing. Quote, Trump originally approved of the hiring, one source told CNN. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=669.04s)]
*  But sources said Trump was then angered after his allies pointed to clips of the lawyer criticizing the false claims that the 2020 [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=674.16s)]
*  election was stolen. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=682.04s)]
*  So two lawyers hired by the RNC to oversee legal efforts around the 2024 election, one of them herself now under indictment. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=684.28s)]
*  The other one reportedly fired. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  Forecasting doubt that the last election was stolen for suggesting that the real election results were a real thing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=698.6s)]
*  Think about that for a second. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=705.12s)]
*  The chief counsel of the National Republican Party just fired reportedly because he was insufficiently enthusiastic about [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=706.6s)]
*  falsifying election results, about working to throw out real election results and get Trump into power despite them. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=713.24s)]
*  I know this feels like, you know, like an incremental update on the day's news, but just step back from this for a second. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  If it is now the de facto position of the mainstream Republican Party that we are not going to use the real results of elections to [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=729.24s)]
*  decide who is in power. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=737.6400000000001s)]
*  If in order to be in a position of authority in the Republican Party now, you must now pledge to reject election results. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=739.48s)]
*  Then tell me, how are we going to decide who is in power in this country? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=747.44s)]
*  What's the other mechanism we're going to use if it's not real election results? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  Democracy is mortal. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=757.24s)]
*  It can be killed. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=759.48s)]
*  It doesn't go away by someone, you know, one day proclaiming we are no longer here by a democracy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=760.96s)]
*  It goes away when there stops being an expectation that we are governed by democratic means, when there stops being an expectation that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=766.44s)]
*  elections are how we decide who's in power. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=773.48s)]
*  The way you lose your democracy is by losing the expectation that we are participating in an election because all sides in that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=777.48s)]
*  election plan to accept the result, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=786.92s)]
*  To go home if they lose and to go into office if they win. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=789.4s)]
*  Once we no longer expect that, we are no longer in a democratic system of government in many important respects. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=792.8s)]
*  Once one of the two major governing parties no longer believes elections are binding, then in many important ways, the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=801.88s)]
*  democracy ship has sailed because they are no longer competing on democratic grounds. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=809.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=815.92s)]
*  Once one of the two major parties is no longer pledging that they will abide by the election results, whether they win or lose, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  the democratic system of government is not threatened with harm. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  It is wounded already. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=829.3199999999999s)]
*  Threats to a democracy are not a theoretical prospect that looms sometime in the future, just like threats to the rule of law. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  Threats to democracy are also here now. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  Poll workers and election workers have been chased out of those jobs by the thousands, by violence and harassment and threats that are [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=841.2800000000001s)]

*  Who is going to stand up and say, OK, well, I'm capable. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=850.2s)]
*  I'm brave. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=855.32s)]
*  I'm willing to do something hard for my country this year, and I can take one of those jobs. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=856.1600000000001s)]
*  I can take one of those seats. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=860.0s)]
*  I can drive people to the polls and door knock for a campaign that I wasn't planning on working for. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=861.6400000000001s)]
*  I will work at a polling place. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=867.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=869.4s)]
*  Who's going to stand up and do that? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=869.5999999999999s)]
*  Because thousands of experienced poll workers have been chased from their jobs because an anti-democratic movement in this country led by the former [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  president has produced such an environment of threat and harassment and violence around those very low level jobs in the technical part of our [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  democracy that those jobs are unfilled. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=889.76s)]
*  Who will fill those jobs? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=892.76s)]
*  Who will do that work? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=893.76s)]
*  It's not an esoteric thing. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=895.52s)]
*  It is a practical thing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=896.8s)]
*  And the time is now. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=898.12s)]
*  It's here. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=899.96s)]
*  And I think the other part of it is recognizing that there is a reason that this is all happening. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=903.88s)]
*  And this, to me, is the opposite of enervating. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=909.6s)]
*  To me, this is energizing, understanding why it's happening, understand the sort of larger plot this is part of. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=911.92s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning historian Ann Applebaum said, I'm going to stand up and do this. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=919.08s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning historian Ann Applebaum is here with us tonight. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=923.36s)]
*  We're going to be speaking with her in just a few moments. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=926.36s)]
*  She's just written this in The Atlantic, which I think is really important. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=929.36s)]
*  The title is Democracy is Losing the Propaganda War. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=934.36s)]
*  Autocrats in China, Russia and other places around the world are now colluding with MAGA Republicans to discredit liberalism and freedom everywhere. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=938.36s)]
*  Applebaum writes that autocratic regimes have slowly turned their repressive mechanisms outward into the democratic world. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=947.4s)]
*  If people are naturally drawn to the image of human rights, to the language of democracy, to the dream of freedom, then those concepts have to be poisoned. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=956.4s)]
*  That requires more than a political system that defends against liberal ideas. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=964.4s)]
*  It also requires an offensive plan, a narrative that damages the idea of democracy everywhere in the world. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=969.4s)]
*  And the tools to deliver it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=975.4399999999999s)]
*  She says, quote, here is a difficult truth. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  A part of the American political spectrum is not merely a passive recipient of the combined authoritarian narratives that come from these authoritarian countries that are working to discredit democracy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=982.4399999999999s)]
*  But a part of the American political spectrum is an active participant in creating and spreading these narratives. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=992.4399999999999s)]
*  Like the leaders of those authoritarian countries, the American MAGA right also wants Americans to believe that their democracy is degenerate, their elections illegitimate, their civilization dying. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1001.48s)]
*  The MAGA movement's leaders also have an interest in pumping nihilism and cynicism into the brains of their fellow citizens and in convincing them that nothing they see is true. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1015.48s)]
*  Their goals are so similar that it is hard to distinguish between the online American alt-right and its foreign amplifiers, who have multiplied since the days when this was solely a Russian project. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1025.52s)]
*  One could call this a secret authoritarian plot to spread anti-democratic conspiracy theories. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1037.52s)]
*  Except that it's not a secret. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1044.52s)]
*  It's all visible right on the surface. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1046.52s)]
*  Authoritarian regimes working with Americans to discredit democracy, to undermine the credibility of democratic leaders, to mock the rule of law. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1047.56s)]
*  They do so with the goal of electing Trump, whose second presidency would damage the image of democracy around the world, as well as the stability of democracy in America even further. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1056.56s)]
*  I'll speak with Anne Applebaum in just a moment. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1070.56s)]
*  I'll just say there is a reason why the damage to the rule of law in our country, the damage to democracy in our country, which we have already started living with. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1072.6s)]
*  There's a reason why it is coincident with a rise in authoritarianism around the world. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1083.6s)]
*  And it's because we as a country are not immune to the same pro-authoritarian, anti-democratic winds that blow through Europe and all over the rest of the world right now, too. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1088.6s)]
*  Our democracy is mortal, too, just like every other democracy in history has ever been. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  Being real about the harm that has been done to us already, being clear-eyed about the fact that we can see some of these same dynamics that work in other countries, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1101.6399999999999s)]
*  tuning into the fact that the right under Donald Trump is admiring of and openly emulating the way other countries have destroyed their democracies, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  recognizing they are willingly part of the same system, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  that to me is energizing. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1121.68s)]
*  I feel like that at least should put some steel in our spine, because it should tell us the part that we have to play here. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1124.68s)]
*  It should at least give us real, grounded, practical expectations of where this is all going to go next and where our efforts are most needed to stand up for who we are. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1132.68s)]
*  It should give us a clear sense of what we're going to need to defend and protect very soon when the leader of our country's branch of this movement, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1141.72s)]
*  sometime very soon, almost inevitably is going to break that court order again and is now, we know today, going to be ordered into a jail cell. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUWWUzOnwo&t=1149.72s)]
