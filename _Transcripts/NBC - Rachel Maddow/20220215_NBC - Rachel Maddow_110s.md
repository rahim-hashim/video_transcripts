# Pentagon All Ears For Ideas On How Bunny Penetrated Security To Access Inner Courtyard
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk)
*  The Pentagon is one of the most secure locations on earth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=0.0s)]
*  Even just to tour the building, you have to make a reservation at least 14 days in advance. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=4.0s)]
*  Then you have to arrive at least an hour in advance to get through all of the security. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=10.0s)]
*  And the tour itself is led by active duty military personnel who never leave your side. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=14.0s)]
*  But Arlington Now News is reporting that somehow yesterday, this bunny infiltrated the Pentagon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=19.0s)]
*  The rabbit somehow got all the way to the courtyard at the very center of the building, which is a crazy feat. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=27.0s)]
*  Pentagon is the largest low rise office building in the world. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=34.0s)]
*  So it's not exactly like the bunny could just hop over the side of the building. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=38.0s)]
*  And even those super secure tours that usually run through the Pentagon, those have been shut down because of covid. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=43.0s)]
*  So it is not like someone snuck the bunny in the building. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=48.0s)]
*  Two weeks ago, a chicken was caught sneaking around the security checkpoint area of the Pentagon. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=52.0s)]
*  Now, the chicken didn't get nearly as far as the bunny. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=57.0s)]
*  At the moment, we do not know if it was planning a coup or why it crossed the road. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=61.0s)]
*  The chicken was apparently winging it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=67.0s)]
*  As for how exactly the bunny hopped over the largest low rise office building in the world into its center courtyard, the prevailing theory is that it was dropped by a hawk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=71.0s)]
*  At present, there is no reason to believe this is foul play, but we will, of course, follow this story down whatever rabbit hole it may lead. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=80.0s)]
*  . [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60NaPJV2Glk&t=110.0s)]
