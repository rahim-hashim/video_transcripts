# Banker Who Tried To Buy His Way Into Trump Administration Gets A Year In Prison
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc)
*  One more thing before we go tonight. Let's call it a trip down memory lane. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's the email that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort received 11 days [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=4.64s)]
*  after the 2016 election from a Chicago banker subject quote Stephen M. Kalk candidate for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=8.88s)]
*  SEC army. The attachment says quote perspective roles in the Trump administration in rank order. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=15.52s)]
*  Yes that is roles as in job functions and not the things into which I put my chicken salad. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=22.16s)]
*  He goes on to list them quote one secretary of the army two deputy secretary of treasury three [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=27.28s)]
*  secretary of commerce. That email about Stephen Kalk by the way was from Stephen Kalk this guy [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=32.96s)]
*  the former CEO of a Midwestern bank called the Federal Savings Bank and that was not any ordinary [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=38.08s)]
*  pitch email from someone trying to curry favor with the incoming administration. It was in fact [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=44.24s)]
*  a bribe. You see in July of 2016 Paul Manafort who was at the time Trump's campaign manager [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=50.08s)]
*  came to Stephen Kalk's bank seeking a multi-million dollar loan. The one glaring problem was that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=57.12s)]
*  Manafort had a lot of red flags on his financials. He was deep in debt. He had multiple properties [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  facing for foreclosure and he needed the money and he needed it fast. So he struck a deal with Kalk. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=68.32s)]
*  Kalk ignored the red flags on Manafort's financials and ended up securing Manafort two loans [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=75.36s)]
*  totaling a whopping 16 million dollars. Days after approving the first loan for Manafort, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=81.12s)]
*  Kalk was appointed to the Trump campaign's economic advisory council. When Manafort needed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  that multi-million dollar second loan this time Kalk approved it and shortly thereafter sent [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  Manafort a list of administration jobs that he wanted. Manafort did end up getting Kalk an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=99.76s)]
*  interview in Trump Tower for undersecretary of the army but Kalk never got the job. He did eventually [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=106.48s)]
*  get indicted for that scheme by federal prosecutors in New York City. He was convicted in July of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  financial institution bribery and conspiracy and yesterday nearly six years after the start of that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=118.08s)]
*  bribery scheme Kalk was finally sentenced. The Department of Justice aptly puts the news in its [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  headline announcing the news quote bank CEO Stephen M. Kalk sentenced to one year and one day [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=130.32s)]
*  for corruptly soliciting a presidential administration position in exchange for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=136.48s)]
*  approving 16 million dollars in loans. In addition to spending 366 days in prison, Kalk must pay over [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  1.2 million dollars in fines, complete 800 hours of community service and undergo two years of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=148.56s)]
*  supervised release. As for Manafort, he too was convicted of multiple felonies and other schemes [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=155.12s)]
*  including bank fraud and filing false tax returns but he is free of course because Donald Trump [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=160.96s)]
*  pardoned him right before he left office. Nice work if you can get it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=167.76s)]
*  you [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A2qeOGu9Bc&t=185.12s)]
