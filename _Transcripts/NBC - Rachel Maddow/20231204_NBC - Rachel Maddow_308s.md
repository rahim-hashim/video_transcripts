Video Description: Rachel Maddow lays out her personal political profile as it relates to Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, which is the exact polar opposite on pretty much every issue. And yet, Maddow notes, the vast distance between them politically is insignificant against the size of the threat Donald Trump poses to the future of the United States. And so on that one matter they have found common ground.

# Maddow: Alignment with polar opposite Liz Cheney shows seriousness of Trump threat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs)
*  So here's the thing about tonight's show. I disagree with Liz Cheney about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=0.0s)]
*  everything. My whole adult life on everything in politics, I would not just [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=7.12s)]
*  say that Liz Cheney and I were on different proverbial teams, I would say [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=13.32s)]
*  we are from different proverbial planets and they are planets that are mostly at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=17.6s)]
*  war with each other. And she's a politician, I'm not a politician, I'm [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=22.96s)]
*  just a person, but I am definitely a liberal and she is definitely a hardcore [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=27.9s)]
*  conservative and I disagree with Liz Cheney on like really on everything you [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=33.26s)]
*  can think of, on the environment, on abortion rights profoundly. I think she's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=39.5s)]
*  not just wrong on abortion, she is capital W wrong on abortion in a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  terrible way. I disagree with her vehemently on voting rights and on the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=49.58s)]
*  Iraq War and the Afghanistan War and our relationship or lack thereof with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=55.18s)]
*  Iran and our approach to terrorism and torture and guns and like mining and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=60.38s)]
*  intellectual property and the rules of the House of Representatives. Honestly I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=67.14s)]
*  once even got mad at Liz Cheney about fishing and it's the one thing you think [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=71.98s)]
*  we'd have in common, right? Even on fishing I got mad at her about something. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=76.38s)]
*  We are opposites and again in some ways this is funny and dumb but it is also, I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=80.74s)]
*  have to tell you in being truly honest, it has been a serious thing to me. It has [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=89.82s)]
*  been part of how I understand myself in my political time as an American that I [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=96.86s)]
*  am someone fundamentally opposed to the politics of Liz Cheney and her father [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  Dick Cheney who was White House Chief of Staff and Defense Secretary before he [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=106.58s)]
*  was Vice President and what I still believe was the fundamentally disastrous [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=110.54s)]
*  George W Bush administration in which Liz Cheney also served. I literally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=114.06s)]
*  started writing books in the first place more than a decade ago because I had so [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=118.42s)]
*  much to get off my chest about what I thought was wrong with the Cheney family [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=123.5s)]
*  approach to war and foreign policy. The first book I ever wrote was inspired by [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=128.02s)]
*  Dick Cheney's minority report in the Iran Contra scandal during the Reagan [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=132.22s)]
*  administration. That first book I ever wrote is literally dedicated to him, to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=136.46s)]
*  former Vice President Dick Cheney, oh please let me interview you and that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=142.3s)]
*  feeling extended to his daughter who is his political descendant both literally [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=146.94s)]
*  and proverbially in every way and you want one more level of it there's one [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  more level of it. As dedicated as Liz Cheney is to her father, Dick Cheney, they [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=158.58s)]
*  are profoundly close as father and daughter. She was profoundly loyal to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=164.98s)]
*  him. There is not room for a piece of paper to slide between them on policy as [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=168.7s)]
*  close as they are as much as she reveres her dad. I feel the same way about my [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=173.17999999999998s)]
*  dad. I wear one piece of jewelry, I wear my dad's high school ring. My dad is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=179.62s)]
*  brilliant and kind and as far as I can tell he is right about absolutely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=186.42s)]
*  everything. He's an Air Force veteran, he's a very careful lawyer and my whole [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=190.9s)]
*  life my dad was kind of the soul of moderation when it came to politics [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=196.62s)]
*  until Liz's dad. The Dick Cheney vice presidency had the effect of an almost [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=201.78s)]
*  religious conversion on my own dad moving his politics what seemed to be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=208.5s)]
*  about 50 points west of where they had ever been before so vehemently did he [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=212.82s)]
*  object as did I to Cheney brand republicanism during the George W. Bush [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=218.22s)]
*  era. So it's weird like they're the big I think the Cheney family is the biggest [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=223.54s)]
*  touchstone that I have in American politics in my lifetime. It is a funny [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=229.74s)]
*  thing but it's also personal and real and it is a thing that matters to me and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=235.02s)]
*  I say this tonight not for the just the gee whiz factor of me having Liz Cheney [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=240.46s)]
*  here tonight. Me having somebody here tonight who you'd never expect. I say [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=247.18s)]
*  this not for just the you know man bites dog weirdness of this. I say it because I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=250.94s)]
*  think in civic terms and sort of American citizenship terms I think it's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=257.58s)]
*  really important how much we disagree. It's important how far apart we are in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  every policy issue imaginable. It is important that Liz Cheney is infinity [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  and I am negative infinity on the ideological number line. It's important [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=270.94s)]
*  because that tells you how serious and big something has to be to put us to put [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=275.46s)]
*  me and Liz Cheney together on the same side of something in American life. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=280.78s)]
*  you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otVhpZeR1Bs&t=305.46s)]
