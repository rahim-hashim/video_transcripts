# 'All the little mysteries': Cohen testimony fills long-standing gaps in Trump hush money scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk)
*  Big night, you guys. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's proceedings, unexpectedly to me, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=1.74s)]
*  were like that helpful moment in the old Agatha Christie-style [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=6.38s)]
*  British detective story, right? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=10.64s)]
*  You've been following along more or less. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=12.34s)]
*  You know who most of the characters are. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=14.58s)]
*  You can at least remember most of their names. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=16.48s)]
*  You know the basic plot of this mystery. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=20.12s)]
*  But then there is this kindness, this great helpful moment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=23.12s)]
*  in the story where the detective sits down under some stupid [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=27.46s)]
*  pretense with some other character, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=31.66s)]
*  and in their conversation, they give you all the answers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=34.3s)]
*  It's okay you haven't been paying close attention all along. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=37.94s)]
*  They, in this conversation, are going to recap the whole story. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=41.24s)]
*  And not only will they get to the big answer, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=44.94s)]
*  the big who done it, they will also give you the solutions [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  to all the other little mysteries and red herrings [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=50.94s)]
*  that popped up over the course of the story. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=54.08s)]
*  That was Michael Agatha Christie Cohen today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=57.22s)]
*  So, for example, why did Michael Cohen make the hush money payments [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  to Stormy Daniels from his home equity line of credit [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=65.92s)]
*  rather than from, I don't know, his bank account? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=69.6s)]
*  Ah, we learned today it's because that account was paperless. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=73.1s)]
*  No statements related to that home equity line of credit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=77.7s)]
*  were going to be mailed to his house. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=81.44s)]
*  So Michael Cohen's wife was never going to see [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=83.5s)]
*  some inexplicable $130,000 payment on a statement [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=86.5s)]
*  and question him as to what he was up to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=90.44s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=93.14s)]
*  Also, why, when the reimbursement was made to Michael Cohen [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=94.42s)]
*  for him paying for Stormy Daniels' hush money, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  why did that include not just the Stormy Daniels reimbursement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=101.12s)]
*  but a bunch of money for a bunch of other things? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, we learned today that this was going to be the last money [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=109.38s)]
*  Michael Cohen ever received from the Trump Organization. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=114.18s)]
*  In these payments, they included everything he was owed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=117.96s)]
*  They were zeroing him out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=121.42s)]
*  He was leaving the company. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=123.0s)]
*  And why was he doing that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=124.36s)]
*  Because if Michael Cohen was still a Trump Organization employee [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  like he had been, it wouldn't make sense for him [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=129.9s)]
*  to be getting checks as a retainer for legal services. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=132.54s)]
*  He would just be getting a salary [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  like he had been for years before. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=138.16s)]
*  So instead, Cohen leaves the Trump Organization, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=140.6s)]
*  becomes the personal attorney to the president, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  which makes the legal retainer checks look like [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=147.68s)]
*  that was how Trump was paying for Cohen's services [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=150.28s)]
*  as his personal attorney. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=152.72s)]
*  In reality, Cohen was never paid anything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=155.02s)]
*  for being personal attorney to the president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=158.32s)]
*  That's just what they called it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  That's just what they called him so it wouldn't look so weird [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=162.32s)]
*  that Trump was paying him $35,000 checks every month. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=165.18s)]
*  Oh, now that makes sense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=169.42s)]
*  Also, why did prosecutors go out of their way [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=171.46s)]
*  to point out that Ben Roethlisberger, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=174.16s)]
*  the former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=176.76s)]
*  had been at the golf event with Donald Trump [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=179.4s)]
*  at the time of the Trump-Stormy Daniels sex, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=181.94s)]
*  alleged sexual encounter? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=186.2s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=188.78s)]
*  Contrary to Trump's denials [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=190.44s)]
*  that he had sex with Stormy Daniels, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=192.32s)]
*  Michael Cohen testified today that when he asked Donald Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  if anything had happened between him and Stormy Daniels, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=198.24s)]
*  Trump bragged to Michael Cohen that, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  yeah, even though he was there at this golf event [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  with Big Ben Roethlisberger, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  the women there, like Stormy Daniels, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  they wanted him more than they wanted Big Ben. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=213.08s)]
*  All the little mysteries that have popped up [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  over the course of us learning about this scandal, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=223.04s)]
*  all the little mysteries that have popped up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=226.12s)]
*  are inexplicable sort of sidebars and detours [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=228.52s)]
*  that we didn't necessarily understand [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=231.56s)]
*  as the prosecution has laid out its case thus far. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=233.96s)]
*  Michael Cohen today provided the all-is-revealed scene [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=236.8s)]
*  in this detective story, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=241.6s)]
*  tying up the loose ends, filling in the gaps in the story, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=243.08s)]
*  and yes, bringing us to the main event, the big whodunit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  Michael Cohen, longtime lawyer, enforcer, bully, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=251.78s)]
*  quote unquote, fixer for former President Donald Trump, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=257.74s)]
*  the man who, in the mob analogy, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=260.66s)]
*  was not so much the hit man as he was the underboss, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=262.58s)]
*  the man who testified today about, for example, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=265.66s)]
*  telling suppliers and contractors and vendors [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=268.02s)]
*  to Trump University that they would get 20% [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=270.26s)]
*  of what they invoiced Trump University for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=273.5s)]
*  or they'd get nothing and they'd like it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=275.94s)]
*  Michael Cohen gave testimony today [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=279.22s)]
*  that Donald Trump was in the room where it happened, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=281.54s)]
*  in the worst possible way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p32w5yfntFk&t=286.14s)]
