# GOP Rep. Ralph Norman Called For Military Takeover To Keep Trump In Power: Report
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8)
*  So, this was January 17th last year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=0.0s)]
*  On January 17th last year, just to get your head around what was going on on that date, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=5.94s)]
*  that was just three days before Joe Biden was set to be inaugurated as the new president [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=10.76s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=15.36s)]
*  Inauguration day was January 20th. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=17.36s)]
*  This was January 17th. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=18.54s)]
*  Eleven days before January 17th was January 6th, when the pro-Trump mob stormed into Congress [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  to try to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election as the new president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=28.72s)]
*  So on January 17th last year, it is a week and a half since January 6th, and it is three [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=34.04s)]
*  days until the inauguration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=39.8s)]
*  And on that date, January 17th, here is a text message that was sent to Donald Trump's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=42.36s)]
*  White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=47.28s)]
*  It says, quote, Mark, in seeing what's happening so quickly and reading about the Dominion [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=49.84s)]
*  lawsuits attempting to stop any meaningful investigation, we are at a point of no return [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=55.24s)]
*  in saving our republic. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=60.84s)]
*  Exclamation point, exclamation point. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=63.0s)]
*  Our all caps last hope is invoking martial law. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=64.8s)]
*  Please urge to president to do so. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=71.08s)]
*  So it's three days before Joe Biden's inauguration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=75.2s)]
*  White House chief of staff is getting this text message urging urging President Trump [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=77.6s)]
*  to invoke martial law spelled M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L misspelled as if the person sending this law [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=81.28s)]
*  thinks there's a Marshall's law and maybe also a Ross dress for less law, possibly a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=88.28s)]
*  TJ Maxx law that could be invoked as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=92.84s)]
*  What he means is martial law, M-A-R-T-I-A-L, as in suspend the Constitution and put the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=95.44s)]
*  military in charge to rule by force. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=101.4s)]
*  Our last hope is invoking martial law. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=105.0s)]
*  Please urge to president to do so. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=108.84s)]
*  This is three days before the inauguration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  Call out the troops, use military force, use weapons of war against the American public [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=115.4s)]
*  in order to stop the inauguration of the new president and instead put Trump in power. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  And you know, this is a message not sent by the White House chief of staff. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=128.08s)]
*  It's a message sent to him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  And so maybe you're thinking, you know, I bet the White House chief of staff gets all [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=132.76s)]
*  kinds of weird spam text messages from over eager Trump supporters. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=136.48s)]
*  I mean, whoever sent this doesn't even know how to spell martial law. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=140.12s)]
*  So how serious could this be? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=144.64s)]
*  But this text message was not from some rando who just guessed the phone number of the White [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=148.24s)]
*  House chief of staff. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=152.88s)]
*  No, this text message was from a sitting member of the United States Congress, Republican [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=153.88s)]
*  Congressman Ralph Norman of South Carolina. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=159.04s)]
*  On January 17th last year, three days before Biden's inauguration, Congressman Ralph [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=163.32s)]
*  Norman was texting Trump's White House chief of staff to urge President Trump to call out [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=168.92s)]
*  the U.S. military to use the military against civilians. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=174.04s)]
*  In order to keep Trump in power. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=180.26s)]
*  Congressman Norman was a sitting member of Congress when he sent that he is still one [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=183.24s)]
*  now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=187.0s)]
*  Ralph Norman was just reelected to Congress in South Carolina's 5th congressional district [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=188.0s)]
*  and he was reelected by a lot. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=192.0s)]
*  He was reelected by like a two to one margin. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=193.16s)]
*  And marveling about the seditious radicalism of a member of Congress. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=197.0s)]
*  Somebody who wants to suspend the Constitution and keep their guy in power by force using [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=204.72s)]
*  military force to do it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=208.82s)]
*  I mean, marveling at some member of Congress being that far out there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's something we all get to do from time to time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=214.92s)]
*  Right now, knowing this is what Ralph Norman was advocating for to the White House, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=219.32s)]
*  Suspend the Constitution, put troops in the streets, take power by force. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  Knowing he was advocating that is one thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  Knowing that he and his party are going back to Congress as the new majority party there [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  for next year. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  That feels like something different. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=236.68s)]
*  Because what are they going to do with their real power when they really have it? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Fs2Lg8in8&t=238.64s)]
