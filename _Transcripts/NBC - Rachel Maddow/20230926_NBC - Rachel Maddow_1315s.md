# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Sept. 25
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo)
*  Ms. Hutchinson, it's nice to meet you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=2.64s)]
*  This is the first live interview you've done in the media. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=3.92s)]
*  It is the second live interview you have done in life. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=9.36s)]
*  The first one was your testimony. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=12.48s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=14.92s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=16.04s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=18.36s)]
*  And it's an honor to have this as my first live interview. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=19.84s)]
*  Well, second live interview, I guess. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=24.0s)]
*  Second live interview. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=25.44s)]
*  The first one, much more consequential than this one. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=26.28s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=28.04s)]
*  I mean, it's been 15 months since that testimony. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=29.84s)]
*  Your life has changed dramatically since then. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=32.24s)]
*  I said, based on what I read in your book, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=34.92s)]
*  but I didn't ask you about this ahead of time, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=37.8s)]
*  I said in my introductory remarks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=39.56s)]
*  that a lot of the reason that people haven't heard from you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=41.0s)]
*  or seen you out in the world in the last 15 months [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=43.56s)]
*  is at least in part because of concerns about your security. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=45.6s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=49.64s)]
*  Is that still a real life concern for you? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=50.44s)]
*  That's a fair assessment, yes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=52.16s)]
*  How are you taking care of yourself in that regard? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=54.28s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to tell me anything I shouldn't know. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  No, you're fine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=58.16s)]
*  Open book. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=59.28s)]
*  It's been difficult in a lot of ways. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=61.04s)]
*  It's also, it's open, this year has been a, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=64.04s)]
*  has helped me open my eyes to the dangers [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=67.12s)]
*  that Trump actually poses on people in these situations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=69.16s)]
*  And I'm not the only one. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=73.52s)]
*  And I wish I could say I'd be the last person, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=74.72s)]
*  but unfortunately I won't. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=77.72s)]
*  And that's what he does to people that he thinks [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=79.04s)]
*  that speak out against him or that detract from him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=83.0s)]
*  And it's one of the more dangerous things [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=86.72s)]
*  about Donald Trump too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=88.4s)]
*  This is something that we've seen time and time again, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=89.48s)]
*  and it shouldn't have to be like this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=91.84s)]
*  You write about in the book repeatedly about your regret [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  as for having not supported him, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=98.56s)]
*  but specifically for having facilitated [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=102.28s)]
*  some of the political attacks that he launched as president [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  on people that were designed the way he designs them, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=108.56s)]
*  to hurt people maximally, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=112.2s)]
*  and in some cases to expose them to danger. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=113.44s)]
*  Did that give you any insight into why he needs politics [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  to work that way for him? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=120.68s)]
*  And any insight into how to combat it? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=121.76s)]
*  It gave me an insight into his psyche [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=125.52s)]
*  while I was writing the book [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  and helping understand my circumstances with it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=129.96s)]
*  and what I dealt with after I testified. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=133.44s)]
*  But with that said, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=137.72s)]
*  it helped also open my eyes to what he wants from people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=141.0s)]
*  He wants to know that he's getting a reaction. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=145.56s)]
*  He thrives when he has an audience. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=147.88s)]
*  It could be a negative audience. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=150.4s)]
*  It could be an audience that he likes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=151.68s)]
*  It could be his base. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=153.8s)]
*  But what he needs is to hear people reacting to him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=155.12s)]
*  And that's when he knows in his mind [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=158.28s)]
*  that he has been successful to something. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=160.04s)]
*  Is that why you've never responded to his attacks on you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=162.16s)]
*  I've never responded to his attacks on me [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=164.88s)]
*  because I don't need to give them oxygen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=166.52s)]
*  He is going to say what he's going to say. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=168.36s)]
*  And he said much worse things [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=170.28s)]
*  about much better people than I am. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=171.6s)]
*  The kind of pressure that you describe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=174.4s)]
*  experiencing to protect Mr. Trump, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=177.4s)]
*  I mean, some of it was self-directed, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=180.0s)]
*  You say at one point in the book, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=183.12s)]
*  and it struck me you said that you adored him at one point, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=185.4s)]
*  that you were and are very much still a Republican, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=188.52s)]
*  that you believed in what he was trying to do for the country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=191.6s)]
*  You wanted to be a good staffer. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=194.24s)]
*  You wanted to serve the White House. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  You wanted to do right by your colleagues. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  And that sort of easily leads [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=199.32s)]
*  toward the next post-presidential project for him, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=202.04s)]
*  which is protecting him from all the investigations [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=204.8s)]
*  around January 6th and everything else. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=207.44s)]
*  But that pressure not only came from you, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=210.08s)]
*  it also came from his world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=212.32s)]
*  You didn't have financial resources to hire your own lawyer. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=214.72s)]
*  You didn't have access to a lawyer at the outset [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=217.0s)]
*  who would represent you for free. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=219.24s)]
*  You ended up with a Trump world lawyer [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=221.12s)]
*  who you describe as having not told you to lie, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=223.24s)]
*  but encouraged you to not tell everything that you knew. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=228.0s)]
*  That pressure is very, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=234.36s)]
*  it's not just a Cassidy Hutchinson biographical detail. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=235.92s)]
*  It is a live issue for a lot of people right now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=238.24s)]
*  It's a lot of people in multiple jurisdictions [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=240.36s)]
*  deciding how they're gonna respond to a subpoena, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=242.12s)]
*  what they may testify to in court, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=245.72s)]
*  what they're gonna do about their legal representation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=247.72s)]
*  This is a live issue for a lot of people right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=249.68s)]
*  And some of them may be watching right now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=253.2s)]
*  What would you say to them [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=255.68s)]
*  about how to balance the equities [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=257.2s)]
*  in that kind of a calculation? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=258.96s)]
*  In my opinion, I don't know if there really is a way [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=263.44s)]
*  to balance the equities. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=267.24s)]
*  If you have a self interest [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  of being completely forthcoming and truthful [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=272.96s)]
*  in what you're witnessing that could potentially hurt [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  or damage Mr. Trump, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=278.64s)]
*  and not even speaking to the issues of legal counsel, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  just as a person knowing what I experienced. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=285.6s)]
*  And like you said, some of it was self-inflicted for me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=288.36s)]
*  I did, I knew what I wanted to do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  I knew how I felt about these circumstances [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  surrounding January 6th, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=296.44s)]
*  but I also was scared to be frank. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=298.36s)]
*  I was scared at times to make that break. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=300.8s)]
*  I had seen what happened to some of my former colleagues [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=303.92s)]
*  who had made that break [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  and how they became the subjects of the vitriol [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=307.48s)]
*  and the vile rhetoric that comes out of Mr. Trump [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=310.04s)]
*  and his associates when you break with him. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=314.16s)]
*  If I were to say anything to the people though, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=317.56s)]
*  that may be finding themselves in a similar situation [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  to the situation that I found myself in, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=323.88000000000005s)]
*  or just that they want to make that break, it's possible. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=325.88000000000005s)]
*  We can't, and what I think is, in my opinion, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=331.0s)]
*  and what I think is damaging in ways [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=334.68s)]
*  is isolating the people that come out [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=337.12s)]
*  and then questioning why they did. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=340.56s)]
*  It is hard to come out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=342.64s)]
*  It was hard to find my way out because of what we said. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  I had financial limitations and I did have other counsel, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=347.68s)]
*  but it was also hard coming out on the outside [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=352.28s)]
*  because I didn't know if I'd be welcomed by people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=354.28s)]
*  So I think that if we can create and foster an environment [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=357.68s)]
*  where people feel that they're welcomed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=361.8s)]
*  and that there is a life on the other side, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=364.32s)]
*  which is one of the more eye-opening parts [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  of this experience for me too, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=369.44s)]
*  is that there are good people in this world [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=370.76s)]
*  that want to help and that are there [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=373.84s)]
*  and that have similar interests that we do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  We all want the republic to survive. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=378.12s)]
*  We all should want the republic to survive. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=380.12s)]
*  But in the way that Mr. Trump's trajectory currently is going, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=383.52s)]
*  I'm not confident that he will have it survive. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=388.12s)]
*  And I would just encourage them to think about that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=392.56s)]
*  When you say that, we speak at a moment [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=396.92s)]
*  when Mr. Trump is dozens of points ahead [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=399.08s)]
*  of his nearest opponent in the Republican presidential primary. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=401.08s)]
*  The tone in the political press about what's happening [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=404.68s)]
*  in the Republican presidential primary [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  is that even people who support his competitors [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  are effectively conceding that he's going to be the nominee. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  Republicans seem poised to choose him again, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  even after what happened the last time [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=418.24s)]
*  and specifically what you were able to tell the country [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=421.4s)]
*  about what it was like inside the White House. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=424.2s)]
*  I was struck in the book, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=426.76s)]
*  not just about what you said about January 6th, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=428.52s)]
*  but some of the other ways that you described [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=430.52s)]
*  what was bad about him as a president. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  On COVID, you said, I doubt any politician [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=436.4s)]
*  could have led the country through the deadliest pandemic [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  in 100 years without making errors of judgment and execution. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=440.8s)]
*  But of all the people in the world, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=444.0s)]
*  President Trump was uniquely unsuited to the challenge. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=445.96s)]
*  He lacked empathy and was stubborn and impatient. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=449.2s)]
*  You said he had a restless, impulsive personality. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  You described his attention span [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=456.52s)]
*  not being up to an average meeting. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=460.44s)]
*  I noticed that his eyes often wandered the room [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=462.56s)]
*  when the meetings outlasted his attention span. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  Ultimately, you described what happened on January 6th [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  as from him at a minimum, a shocking dereliction of duty. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=469.68s)]
*  I mean, all of the things that you described [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=473.12s)]
*  from having seen him up close are public record now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=475.4s)]
*  None of these things are secrets. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=478.68s)]
*  Why do you think your fellow Republicans [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=480.84s)]
*  want him more than they want anybody else [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=484.32s)]
*  as their next candidate for the White House? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=487.68s)]
*  I can't speak to the psyche of my, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=490.64s)]
*  I won't say my fellow Republicans [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=493.52s)]
*  because I do not think that we are a part [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=494.92s)]
*  of the same Republican Party. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=497.64s)]
*  I still consider myself a Republican. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  I consider myself a Republican in the sense of Senator Mitt [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  Romney and the Reagan Republican Party. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=506.24s)]
*  I believe that the Republican Party [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=509.32s)]
*  needs a strong conservative party. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=510.8s)]
*  I do not believe that Mr. Trump is a strong Republican, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=513.24s)]
*  but in this next election cycle, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  in my opinion, it's the make or break moment [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=520.88s)]
*  for the Republican Party. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=522.84s)]
*  Now is the time if these politicians, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=524.76s)]
*  these men and some women that are currently in Congress [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=527.5200000000001s)]
*  want to make the break and want to take the stand, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  they have to do it now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=534.08s)]
*  We can't wait any longer for them to do it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=536.6s)]
*  I don't know why they're so willing to support him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=539.12s)]
*  I think it's extremely disappointing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=543.36s)]
*  and it is not a hard issue to take. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=545.08s)]
*  It's we're talking about a man who at the very essence [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=547.2s)]
*  of his being almost destroyed democracy in one day [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  and he wants to do it again. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=555.88s)]
*  He wants to run for president to do it again. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  He's been indicted four times since January 6th. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=560.32s)]
*  I would not have a clear conscience [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  and be able to sleep at night [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=565.88s)]
*  if I were a Republican in Congress [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=566.96s)]
*  that supported Donald Trump. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=569.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think that if they're not willing to split with that, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=571.8s)]
*  then we're in serious danger for the party. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=576.12s)]
*  Ms. Hutchinson, one of the claims in your book [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  that received some attention ahead of publication [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=582.52s)]
*  is an allegation you make [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=587.0s)]
*  that Rudy Giuliani effectively groped you [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=588.52s)]
*  at the Trump rally on January 6th. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=591.68s)]
*  You say that he reached his hand under your blazer [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=594.04s)]
*  and then under your skirt. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=596.92s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani's spokesperson has called this [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=599.28s)]
*  a disgusting lie against Mayor Giuliani. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=601.92s)]
*  He gave us that statement again himself tonight. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=604.96s)]
*  But I was struck by the fact that he was not the only one. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  Page 52 of the book, you say that John Boehner, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  of all people, looked down at my cranberry vodka [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=613.84s)]
*  and whispered dark liquor or red wine from now on. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=617.48s)]
*  Then he tugged on the ends of my hair saying, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=620.48s)]
*  and lose the ponytail. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=623.72s)]
*  You describe one man who worked in the White House, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  Mike McKenna, as having a tendency [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=629.04s)]
*  to publicly single out women [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=630.6s)]
*  with crude and demeaning comments. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  You describe the president, and this is not groping, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=635.0s)]
*  this is not physical, but you describe him [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=637.36s)]
*  as telling you to add blonde highlights to your hair, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=640.04s)]
*  which you then went home and did and came back to them [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=642.92s)]
*  to the White House the next day. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=644.8s)]
*  That doesn't happen in normal workplaces. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=646.52s)]
*  I'm just telling you now, sorry. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=648.4s)]
*  I learn a lot on the outside. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=650.76s)]
*  Yes, there's a whole world out there [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=652.12s)]
*  when guys get fired for doing stuff like that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=656.92s)]
*  Well, it shouldn't be unbelievable. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=658.12s)]
*  Shouldn't be unbelievable. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=660.0s)]
*  But there's also a couple of instances [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=661.16s)]
*  involving Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=664.56s)]
*  I will omit most of the context here, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=667.52s)]
*  but I'll tell you the lines that have kept me [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=668.9599999999999s)]
*  up and uncomfortable. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=671.36s)]
*  He chuckled and brushed his thumb across my chin. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=673.28s)]
*  Has anyone ever told you you're a national treasure? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=675.92s)]
*  You describe a night at Camp David [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=679.4s)]
*  when he was leaning against the door frame [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=681.52s)]
*  while somebody answered the door to another cabin. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=685.16s)]
*  Matt straightened his posture when Kevin McCarthy [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=688.04s)]
*  asked him what he wanted. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=690.36s)]
*  He explained he had seen my golf cart parked outside [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=691.3199999999999s)]
*  and thought this was my cabin. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=693.92s)]
*  Embarrassed, I got up and asked Mr. Gaetz what he needed. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  He explained that he was lost and asked me [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=698.04s)]
*  to escort him to his cabin. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=700.68s)]
*  I told him to proceed around the circle drive. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=702.48s)]
*  All the cabins are clearly marked. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  It's impossible to get lost. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=706.48s)]
*  He asked me one more time to leave with him. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=707.92s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy then said, quote, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=710.56s)]
*  get a life mat and shut the door. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=712.04s)]
*  Now, Mr. Gaetz, we asked him for comment [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  on these allegations tonight. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=717.76s)]
*  He told us, I don't remember either of these events [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=719.04s)]
*  and based on Cassidy's prior false statements, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  I doubt they occurred. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=724.8s)]
*  I did date Cassidy for a few weeks [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=726.1999999999999s)]
*  when we were both single years ago. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=729.3199999999999s)]
*  We parted amicably and remained friends thereafter, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=731.9599999999999s)]
*  even during President Trump's post presidency. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=734.8s)]
*  And then he goes on to make other unrelated claims. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=738.76s)]
*  I'm sorry to ask you if you want to respond to that, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=743.12s)]
*  but I'm going to ask you if you want to respond. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=745.32s)]
*  I would love to respond to that, Rachel. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=746.44s)]
*  Thank you for giving me the option. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=748.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=749.8000000000001s)]
*  I will give Matt credit in his part of the statement [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=751.52s)]
*  that we did have an amicable working relationship [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=753.84s)]
*  and we were good friends at points. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=756.88s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, in my opinion, is somebody [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=761.88s)]
*  that I personally do not hold in high regards [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=764.24s)]
*  in terms of trust. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=767.48s)]
*  And I do not think that Matt Gaetz [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=769.4000000000001s)]
*  has the best track record for relationships [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=770.24s)]
*  and condoning his relationships [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=773.48s)]
*  how he thinks that they might be defined. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=776.84s)]
*  I will say on behalf of myself, I never dated Matt Gaetz. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=779.1600000000001s)]
*  I have much higher standards in men [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=783.5200000000001s)]
*  and Matt, frankly, is a very unserious politician. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  We see that today with the ruckus [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=789.44s)]
*  that he is causing on Capitol Hill [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=791.96s)]
*  with the spending negotiations. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  And I don't really have much else to say [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=795.44s)]
*  to somebody that is more concerned about a soundbite [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=797.88s)]
*  than actually passing legislation. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=800.32s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani's remark in response to your allegation [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=803.2s)]
*  about him, which was graphic and gross, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=806.84s)]
*  was that this was a disgusting lie against him. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you stand by that statement despite his pushback? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=812.64s)]
*  I stand by my statement and what I described in the book [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=814.72s)]
*  and I agree that it was gross. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=818.16s)]
*  Cassie Hutchinson, you have been through a lot, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=821.96s)]
*  particularly as a very young woman [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=824.04s)]
*  who had to do a lot of this on her own. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=825.64s)]
*  The record that you've given us is much, much, much more complete [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  than anybody else could have given us [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=830.92s)]
*  and it took a lot of bravery to get there. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=832.52s)]
*  This has been a hard time in your life, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=834.52s)]
*  but you've done a service to your country [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=837.16s)]
*  and I hope that good things happen for you. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=838.64s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=840.64s)]
*  Congratulations. Thank you. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=841.92s)]
*  All right. Former White House aide Cassie Hutchinson [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=843.04s)]
*  has a new book. It is called Enough. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=846.28s)]
*  It's out tomorrow. It is full of news. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=848.76s)]
*  You should read it. Back with us once again [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=850.9599999999999s)]
*  is Cassie Hutchinson. Her new book is called Enough. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=853.88s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. Thank you again for being here. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=856.36s)]
*  You write in the book in detail about your interactions [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=859.52s)]
*  with the January 6th committee. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=863.84s)]
*  You did six interviews with them plus the live testimony. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=864.88s)]
*  But then you also say that you met, I believe, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=868.52s)]
*  three times with Justice Department personnel [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=870.64s)]
*  and prosecutors and once with the Fulton County grand jury. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=872.96s)]
*  Is that all correct? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=875.88s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=877.4s)]
*  Do you expect to be called to testify [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=878.32s)]
*  in any of the Trump trials? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=881.0s)]
*  I have fully complied with all government investigations [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=883.0s)]
*  in all entities thus far and I will continue to do so. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=886.2s)]
*  You can't talk about whether you're going to testify. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=889.6400000000001s)]
*  If or when I am asked to testify, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=892.12s)]
*  I will comply as fully as I have in the past. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  Did prosecutors involved in any of those conversations [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  or any of the live cases [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=902.24s)]
*  ask you to leave certain topics out of the book? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=904.0s)]
*  No. No. Everything that is in the book [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=907.5600000000001s)]
*  is also consistent with my transcripts [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=911.6s)]
*  that are on the record with the January 6th committee. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=913.36s)]
*  Well, everything pertaining to the election fraud. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=917.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  And Mr. Trump's attempt to overthrow the government [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=921.08s)]
*  to stay in power, all in the public record. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=924.24s)]
*  One of the things that you describe in some detail [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=928.32s)]
*  in the book that I don't just quite know what to make of [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=930.6400000000001s)]
*  involves your direct boss, Mark Meadows. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=933.8000000000001s)]
*  I've been describing you with the shorthand [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  and you use this in the book. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=939.24s)]
*  You say sort of chief of staff to the chief of staff. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=940.2s)]
*  You're essentially the top staffer to Mr. Meadows. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=942.12s)]
*  So you're with him a lot of the time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  You definitely know what's going on in his life. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=945.84s)]
*  You're close to him in the work sense [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=948.24s)]
*  every day that he's in the office. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=952.24s)]
*  And yet there is some mystery that I don't totally understand [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  as to what he was burning in his fireplace [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=958.44s)]
*  and to what he was doing with either classified [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=961.84s)]
*  or previously classified documents [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=965.32s)]
*  related to crossfire hurricane, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=967.28s)]
*  related to the Russia investigation. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=968.92s)]
*  Are you describing what appeared to you [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=972.28s)]
*  to be either mishandling of classified information [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=975.64s)]
*  or mishandling of presidential records, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  destruction of presidential records, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=981.6s)]
*  which of course is not allowed? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=983.0s)]
*  The final days, it obviously was chaotic in a number of ways. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=986.4s)]
*  I was under the impression, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=992.08s)]
*  and I know there were several of my colleagues [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=993.76s)]
*  that were under the impression that how classified documents [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=995.5600000000001s)]
*  were being handled was not within proper protocol. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=998.64s)]
*  Now, with saying that, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1004.12s)]
*  I think it speaks also just to how reckless and careless [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1007.44s)]
*  much of the administration was [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  not taking classified document protocol seriously a lot of the time. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1014.76s)]
*  We've seen that with Mr. Trump as well. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1019.12s)]
*  But specific to my experience with Mr. Meadows [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1021.44s)]
*  in the final days of the administration, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1025.24s)]
*  I talk about it a lot in the book to shed light [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1028.28s)]
*  on how chaotic things were. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1030.56s)]
*  But I can't really speak to what he was doing. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1033.04s)]
*  I would leave that as a question to him. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1035.96s)]
*  I mean, it does sound like there were confrontations [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1039.04s)]
*  in the White House, including those that involved you, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1041.56s)]
*  related to perceived mishandling of sensitive information. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1044.0s)]
*  I dropped the bag on Pat Cipollone's floor. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1049.84s)]
*  Here are your classified documents [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1052.36s)]
*  back from the reporter's mark. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1053.96s)]
*  I didn't hide my contempt, my words rife with sarcasm. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1056.12s)]
*  Mark and Mr. Cipollone peered into the bag. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1059.48s)]
*  I saw Mark swallow hard. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  Pat shot me a piercing look. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1063.6s)]
*  Overwhelmed, Pat agonized. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1065.52s)]
*  Seriously, seriously, we do not have time for this. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1067.12s)]
*  I was already walking out of his office. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1070.0s)]
*  You then describe Mr. Meadows at 11.45 a.m. on Inauguration Day, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1073.08s)]
*  asking the Secret Service how quickly they can get [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1077.56s)]
*  to the Justice Department [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1080.04s)]
*  because he wants to try to declassify something, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1081.48s)]
*  literally in the last 15 minutes [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1084.04s)]
*  when Donald Trump is president. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1085.96s)]
*  Joe Biden's about to get sworn in, so yes. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1090.12s)]
*  What was he trying to do? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1091.76s)]
*  That specific binder was pertinent to Crossfire Hurricane, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1093.44s)]
*  which, for the record, at the time, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1097.84s)]
*  I had no idea what Crossfire Hurricane was. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1099.32s)]
*  But looking at the bigger picture here, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1102.92s)]
*  bringing it back to next year's election, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1106.24s)]
*  these people very well could be in power again. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1109.52s)]
*  And do we want people who have already shown [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1112.32s)]
*  that they're willing and want to overthrow an election, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1115.76s)]
*  for a duly elected president, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1121.72s)]
*  which is the pinnacle of our democracy, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1124.12s)]
*  do we want to put people like that back in power? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1126.4399999999998s)]
*  Do we want to put people back in power that have mishandled [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1128.9199999999998s)]
*  and have been shown to mishandle [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1133.32s)]
*  the most sensitive national security secrets [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1135.72s)]
*  that our nation has? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1137.9199999999998s)]
*  That's the question that we need to ask ourselves. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1140.1599999999999s)]
*  We got a statement from a spokesperson [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1142.6s)]
*  for Mr. Meadows tonight, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  not sort of just vaguely casting aspersions at you, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1148.6399999999999s)]
*  so most of the statement, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1151.28s)]
*  but then saying much of her claims in this book [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1152.7199999999998s)]
*  about Mr. Meadows or otherwise are filled with half-truths, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1155.12s)]
*  falsehoods, and purposefully omitting context to sell books. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1159.6399999999999s)]
*  Mr. Meadows is essentially just casting aspersions [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1165.0s)]
*  on your character. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1167.6799999999998s)]
*  He's saying that you are making things up out of whole cloth [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1170.3600000000001s)]
*  in order to make money. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1172.56s)]
*  You worked so closely with him for a long time, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1174.56s)]
*  but you also describe in the book [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1178.4s)]
*  that you never really trusted him, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1179.52s)]
*  and there are several instances you described [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1180.76s)]
*  in which he flat out lied to you, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1182.2s)]
*  even on that close working matters [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1183.92s)]
*  where you should have been on the same side. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1185.88s)]
*  I should just ask for a response to you for that statement [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1189.4s)]
*  and ask you what you think happened [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1192.48s)]
*  between you and Mark Meadows. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1193.84s)]
*  I don't think there was anything [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1195.56s)]
*  necessarily negative to happen between me and Mark Meadows. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1198.8s)]
*  I was very outspoken after January 6th [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1202.52s)]
*  about how I felt about it. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1205.2s)]
*  Mark and I also knew that we were two different people, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1206.8s)]
*  and that's okay. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1209.68s)]
*  You know, we regularly talked about it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1210.52s)]
*  We would regularly joke about it, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  that I was more moderate than he was, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1213.84s)]
*  but we did in large part work well together. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1215.68s)]
*  More ideologically moderate. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1218.04s)]
*  Yes, yes, ideologically moderate, more so than he was, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1219.2s)]
*  but putting that aside, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1222.4s)]
*  in an environment like that, that doesn't matter as much. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1225.44s)]
*  In terms of his statement, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1229.64s)]
*  I would encourage him to go testify under oath [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  if he thinks that what is in the book [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1233.3200000000002s)]
*  and what I have testified to under oath, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1235.76s)]
*  which is consistent with what is in the book, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1238.0s)]
*  he can go testify under oath [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1241.68s)]
*  if he has strong feelings about that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1243.0400000000002s)]
*  Were you disappointed that the Justice Department elected [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1245.16s)]
*  not to prosecute him for contempt of Congress [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  when he ignored the congressional subpoena [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1249.3600000000001s)]
*  that you responded to from the January 6th investigation? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1252.8s)]
*  I'll leave it to Mr. Meadows and his team to respond to that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1256.9199999999998s)]
*  What I will say is I hope that Mark [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1259.9599999999998s)]
*  is now doing the right thing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1263.04s)]
*  What I define as the right thing, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1266.32s)]
*  which is coming forth and honoring your oath [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1268.36s)]
*  is work to protect your country, not your president. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2u-2MIOxwo&t=1271.3999999999999s)]
