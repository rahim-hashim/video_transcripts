# Russia's Last Independent TV Channel Shutters Amid Putin's Crackdown On Media
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8)
*  Among those fleeing are journalists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=0.0s)]
*  After Russia blocked its last independent TV channel, TV Reign, and the network made [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=2.0s)]
*  the decision to shut down, several of its leaders fled the country in fear for their [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=6.48s)]
*  safety. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=10.68s)]
*  For the station's final broadcast today, those staffers remaining in the studio gathered [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=11.68s)]
*  for a farewell at the anchor desk. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=15.48s)]
*  While others waved goodbye over Zoom, the broadcast included an emotional farewell from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  TV Reign's editor-in-chief, who told his colleagues, quote, we are on the right side [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=23.64s)]
*  of history. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=29.24s)]
*  This is TV Reign's editor-in-chief just a week ago, interviewing top American State [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=30.6s)]
*  Department official Victoria Nuland on his network. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=34.4s)]
*  Now that network, that network bringing information to people inside of Russia is shut down. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=37.4s)]
*  And he has been forced to flee Russia for his safety. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=44.04s)]
*  Joining us now is Tikhon Zidako, editor-in-chief of TV Reign, Russia's last independent TV [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=48.8s)]
*  station. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Tikhon Zidako, thank you so much for joining us and being here with us, especially under [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=55.64s)]
*  these difficult circumstances and conditions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=59.28s)]
*  I know that you and your colleagues at TV Reign have left Russia because you felt that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  staying there posed a personal safety risk for you, your teams, your families. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=67.88s)]
*  We know that the Kremlin has severely restricted media freedom in Russia this week, but have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=73.0s)]
*  there been specific threats made against you and your colleagues at TV Reign that you can [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=78.2s)]
*  tell us about? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, yes, that's correct. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=84.68s)]
*  Three days ago, me and the two of my colleagues, we started to receive threats in texts on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=87.64s)]
*  our phones and in the messages in social media. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  This is something which has been happening all the years when your phone number is published [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=102.0s)]
*  somewhere, and usually you don't pay a lot of attention to it because it's some part [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=111.16s)]
*  of an information war, I would say. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=116.28s)]
*  But now, in these circumstances, it is completely different. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=120.16s)]
*  In this atmosphere, you start to think differently about it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I consider these texts pretty serious. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=130.88s)]
*  You describe the text and the threats and how you're taking them serious, but can you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=137.4s)]
*  just tell us about the last week in terms of working as a journalist in Russia? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=141.2s)]
*  Can you describe for us the kind of environment that you and your team were working in specifically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=145.72s)]
*  after Putin launched this war against Ukraine? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=151.28s)]
*  Well, on last Thursday, the world changed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=154.6s)]
*  I was heading to the office because I had a show in the morning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  But on my way to the TV station in the cap, my producer called me and told me that Vladimir [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  Putin announced that he started a war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=178.76s)]
*  So everything changed afterwards. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  We changed our normal programming. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  So we became almost nonstop on air shows. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=189.4s)]
*  And we've been working 24 to 7 as normal journalists. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=197.76s)]
*  We had journalists in Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=202.44s)]
*  We were talking to them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=205.68s)]
*  We were talking to politicians in Russia, in Ukraine, in the West, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=207.68s)]
*  But then the situation started to change. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=214.32s)]
*  First, there was this huge problem with the military censorship in Russia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  It is a very interesting situation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  The Russian government does not admit that there is a war. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=226.8s)]
*  The Russian government even forbids to use the word war. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=230.0s)]
*  It says to use the word special military operation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=237.0s)]
*  But at the same time, there is no war, but there is a military censorship. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=241.96s)]
*  So first, we, I mean TVRain and some other medias, we get a warning from the Russian [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  government that we have to use only official information from the Ministry of Defense. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=255.4s)]
*  And of course, it's impossible if you use only this information. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=261.4s)]
*  You become part of the state propaganda. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=265.16s)]
*  And in several days after it, our website was blocked. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  And the website, as you mentioned, the website of Echo Moskvy and some other medias. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=276.76s)]
*  Just two days ago, just two hours ago, the website of Medusa, it is a very popular, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  independent website, was blocked as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=289.0s)]
*  And I think, and I saw that Facebook is blocked as well in Moscow. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  So as you mentioned, it is a huge and the strongest crackdown on independent media [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=296.44s)]
*  and the independent mind in Russia. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=304.76s)]
*  It's pretty terrible. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=307.16s)]
*  It is terrible. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=308.2s)]
*  And it is frightening to see this information blackout being imposed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=308.84s)]
*  I just want to ask you really quickly, if I can, your final thoughts, because as I [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=311.88s)]
*  understood it in your remarks to your staff, you said that no matter how bad things get [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=315.32s)]
*  and how many people might be pleased to see your station stop broadcasting, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=320.36s)]
*  your channel will still win. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=325.48s)]
*  How? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  How will you win? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=328.44s)]
*  What does victory look like for you? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, if you maybe you saw that in Russia, we saw the numbers that 62 percent of Russian [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=333.0s)]
*  citizens support the war. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  I do not trust these numbers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=345.24s)]
*  And I know that these numbers are false. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=347.88s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=352.12s)]
*  I know that not a lot of people in Russia support the war. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=353.32s)]
*  And I know that even in the government, not a lot of people support the war, which tells [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=358.04s)]
*  me that somehow one day the situation will end. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=365.8s)]
*  Somehow one day Russia will become a normal country because the majority of Russians want [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=370.92s)]
*  to live in a normal civilized country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=377.56s)]
*  And civilized country means that it has normal media, such as TV rain. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=380.76s)]
*  So I am completely sure that Russian people, they have requests to normalize and they will [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=387.88s)]
*  finally one day they will get it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=395.88s)]
*  I have made this point time and time again. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=399.24s)]
*  The Russian people are not the Russian government. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=401.0s)]
*  They are not Vladimir Putin, Tikhon Zetko, editor-in-chief of TV rain. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=407.8s)]
*  Russia's last independent TV channel. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=408.6s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your time and your insights. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=410.36s)]
*  Stay safe, please. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-RwT-Hgu8&t=411.96000000000004s)]
