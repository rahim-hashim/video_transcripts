# Fake Trump Elector Loses Reelection Bid To Volunteer Poll Worker
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA)
*  We spent a good deal of tonight's show talking about Russian disinformation and anti-democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=0.0s)]
*  behavior. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=5.8s)]
*  Of course, back home in the United States, we've had to contend with our fair share of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=6.8s)]
*  both. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=10.08s)]
*  You may recall the fraudulent electors' scheme conducted as part of Donald Trump and his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=11.08s)]
*  allies' attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=15.52s)]
*  Trump allies in at least seven states, one by President Biden, signed election certification [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=19.6s)]
*  documents falsely declaring themselves the real electors, even though they weren't. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=25.0s)]
*  That fake elector plot overseen by Trump campaign officials, including Rudy Giuliani, is now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=30.9s)]
*  being investigated by the Justice Department. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  At least eight of the 84 Republicans who signed their names falsely listing themselves as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=38.36s)]
*  electors were elected officeholders. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=43.8s)]
*  One of those elected officials was Kelly Rue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=47.36s)]
*  She's an older person for a town in Wisconsin, though she won't be for much longer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=50.0s)]
*  Fraudulent elector Kelly Rue was up for a second term of office as a municipal official [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  in De Pere, Wisconsin. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=60.06s)]
*  It's just south of Green Bay. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=61.7s)]
*  And last night, Rue, just like the former president she supported, lost her bid for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=63.64s)]
*  re-election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=68.62s)]
*  In a triumph for Wisconsin Democrats, Pamela Gantz, a volunteer poll worker, ousted Rue [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=69.74s)]
*  by 118 votes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=75.8s)]
*  The Democratic state party chair tweeted that the victory was, quote, a win in a small election [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=78.42s)]
*  that sends a big message. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=83.28s)]
*  If you try to undermine Wisconsin's democracy, you will be held accountable. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=85.36s)]
*  Voters like democracy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=90.68s)]
*  Gantz herself spoke to a voting rights-focused magazine immediately after her win and told [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  them, quote, I promise not to use my position to influence any national elections or support [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=97.72s)]
*  conspiracies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=103.6s)]
*  I promise to keep it local and promote fair and free elections for our community, end quote. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwBBE9Y3AYA&t=104.6s)]
