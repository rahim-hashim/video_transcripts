# As Putin's Invasion Upends Ukrainians' Lives, A New Enmity Grows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM)
*  Given the opportunity to send their loved ones to safety, it is no wonder that Ukrainian families are living apart. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=0.0s)]
*  And while the pain of that is no doubt immeasurable, today there was a little bit of good news for Ina Sovson and her family. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=6.5s)]
*  This week she made the decision to briefly leave the city to see her son Martin, and today she shared this picture. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=13.5s)]
*  When a two-day curfew was announced in Kyiv, I took it as a sign that I need to go see my son in western Ukraine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=20.0s)]
*  After all, I needed to check if he's doing his maths. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=26.5s)]
*  Joining us now, Ina Sovson. She's a member of the Ukrainian parliament. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=30.0s)]
*  We have many matters to discuss, and we're so grateful that you're back with us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=33.0s)]
*  But the most important question is, has Martin been doing his maths? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=36.5s)]
*  Well, it was time for me to come to make sure that he's doing more. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=42.0s)]
*  So there is the right issues that we needed to discuss. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=45.5s)]
*  Well said. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=49.5s)]
*  That is a good answer from a mother. Bearing in mind that you don't want to disclose, we don't want to disclose where you are. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=52.5s)]
*  But can you describe some of the things that you saw as you journeyed west from Kyiv to reunite with your son? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=58.5s)]
*  What was it like before you left, and what did you see on the way? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=64.5s)]
*  So in order to travel to the western Ukraine, I took a train. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=69.5s)]
*  Now all the trains are free, so you just get to the train station, you take the train, and you ask, like, can I get in? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=73.5s)]
*  You get in. The trains are overcrowded, but not as they were about two weeks ago. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=80.5s)]
*  They don't give you a precise schedule. They just tell you, like, we can be in this city at around this time, but we can be one to two hours late. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=85.5s)]
*  And there are many people who are trying to evacuate fully. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=94.5s)]
*  So there were many people with the bags and cats and dogs and all. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=98.5s)]
*  And on some station, there was the nice part of the journey. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=103.5s)]
*  The train conductors came to the two people and said, like, do you want something to eat? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=107.5s)]
*  And people were not sure if they should pay or not. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=112.5s)]
*  And then they said, this is from volunteers who just have given food to people who are traveling to the west. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=115.5s)]
*  And so that was a very sad journey because I could see many people were just fleeing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=121.5s)]
*  There was a couple from Kharkiv that I was traveling close to, people from Kyiv Oblast, that were trying to escape to some parts of western Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=128.5s)]
*  So that is the story as it is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=137.5s)]
*  And then when I came to the western Ukraine, it is safer than it is in other parts of Ukraine, but they're still getting the sirens here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=139.5s)]
*  So Martin, my son, he first he saw me, he hugged me, and then he said, oh, mom, I'm going to tell you a hilarious story. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=146.5s)]
*  And I was like, OK, go on. And he said, like, yesterday we were playing after school. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=154.5s)]
*  He has online school now. We decided to go outside and we were putting our own clothes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=158.5s)]
*  It took us a while to get ready, so on and so forth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=164.5s)]
*  And the very second we get out of the door, we hear the sirens and we have to go back to the bunker. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=167.5s)]
*  And he was thinking that this is funny because like this happened the very second they went outside. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=173.5s)]
*  I heard that and I thought like, oh, my gosh, I so much hate Putin for the very fact that my son now knows. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=178.5s)]
*  Like then when we hear siren, you have to go back inside and get into the bunker. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=185.5s)]
*  I do want to get your reaction to the news of your hometown of Harkiv, where Russian forces are continuing to bomb the area. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=189.5s)]
*  They've caused a fire at one of those largest street markets, which I'm sure you're familiar with. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=198.5s)]
*  Are you hearing from friends and family in eastern Ukraine who are really suffering this bombardment? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=203.5s)]
*  This large market that you're referring to, actually, my dad worked at that market still 2014 when they moved to Turkey. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=209.5s)]
*  He was in the region. So I know that place so very well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=217.5s)]
*  It's literally one of the hugest street markets in Europe, I believe. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=221.5s)]
*  It's a workplace for many people. It employed many people in Harkiv. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=226.5s)]
*  And it's just one of the new attacks in the key of the story in Harkiv. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=231.5s)]
*  My parents don't live there anymore. But of course, we do have many friends and family members there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=238.5s)]
*  And I was talking to my mom recently and asked her, like, have you been in touch with those people and those people? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=243.5s)]
*  And the majority of people left the city to go like in Harkiv region, some way in smaller villages and all. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=249.5s)]
*  And we had some some family member who was distant relative. Let's put it this way. It's complicated. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=256.5s)]
*  But who was Russian? Like she was ethnically Russian. She had family in Russia. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=262.5s)]
*  And she was always very pro-Russian. She was always claiming that we need to be closer with Russia. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=268.5s)]
*  Those are our friends, our brothers. And I don't understand what is the whole fuss about. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=273.5s)]
*  And now she's in the city being bombarded. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=279.5s)]
*  And apparently her whole view of world and her understanding of world just blew up the very first moment that they heard the bombs exploding in Harkiv. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=283.5s)]
*  And she's extremely confused right now. But now she's not saying that Russians are our friends anymore, just like many other people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=293.5s)]
*  I heard another story again, friend of a friend situation who was again very pro-Russian. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=299.5s)]
*  He now joined the territorial defense and is ready to fight for the city. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=304.5s)]
*  So those those bombardments, they actually changed the understanding of the situation and the geopolitics in Harkiv so rapidly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=309.5s)]
*  Like this is one of the most patriotic and pro-Ukrainian city in Ukraine right now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=316.5s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh5PiMCKMQM&t=323.5s)]
