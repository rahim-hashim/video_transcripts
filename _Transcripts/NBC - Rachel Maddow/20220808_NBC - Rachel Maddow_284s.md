# Trump's Unprecedented Behavior In Office Yields Unprecedented Legal Scrutiny
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg)
*  Tomorrow is the day when you're going to want to buy the physical copy of the newspaper. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=0.0s)]
*  You're going to want to buy it and fold it carefully, maybe put it in a little archival paper or parchment if you don't have that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=4.0s)]
*  Put it away someday. You might, depending on how saucy you're feeling, you might want to just note, perhaps in archival ink in the margin of tomorrow's paper, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=11.0s)]
*  note anniversary of Richard Nixon's resignation as president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=21.0s)]
*  People will get a kick out of that some years down the road. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=26.0s)]
*  I mean, the reason you might buy tomorrow's paper is because if the world doesn't collapse into ash by then, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=30.0s)]
*  your grandkids' grandkids someday are going to look at that old physical newspaper you were able to save from August 9th, 2022, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=38.0s)]
*  and they are going to goggle at the thought of what your life must have been like. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=46.0s)]
*  They are going to goggle at the thought of what it must have been like for you to see something like this happening in your lifetime, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=51.0s)]
*  in real time for the first time ever in American history, having no idea how it would play out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=58.0s)]
*  Nothing like this has ever happened before, and we don't know how this ends. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=64.0s)]
*  Tonight's news that the FBI has raided the home of the immediate past president of the United States. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=69.0s)]
*  It feels both astonishing and sort of inevitable in equal measure. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=74.0s)]
*  Before Republican President Donald J. Trump, we'd never before had a president impeached twice in a single term. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=79.0s)]
*  We'd never had so many members of a president's own party vote not only to impeach him, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=86.0s)]
*  but to convict him and remove him from office and bar him from ever serving in office again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=91.0s)]
*  We had never before had a president reject the results of the election that did remove him from office. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=96.0s)]
*  We'd never before had a president summon his followers to a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=101.0s)]
*  to try to stop the transfer of power to his successor. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=106.0s)]
*  We had never before had a president who was known to tear up official government documents, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=109.0s)]
*  whose chief of staff is reported to have burned government documents in a White House fireplace, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=115.0s)]
*  which would be the most lurid document destruction we've ever heard of in any presidential administration, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=121.0s)]
*  were it not for the fact that the former president himself has repeatedly been credibly accused [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=126.0s)]
*  of flushing government documents down a variety of nearby toilets. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=131.0s)]
*  So even the burning them in the White House fireplace detail is frankly trumped. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=135.0s)]
*  This is a former president who, unlike any other former president in the United States, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=141.0s)]
*  is under active criminal investigation in multiple venues. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=147.0s)]
*  He's under active criminal investigation in the state of Georgia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=150.0s)]
*  His lawyers are reportedly negotiating already with the Justice Department in Washington. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=153.0s)]
*  Witnesses before a federal criminal grand jury have reportedly been asked about his actions. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=157.0s)]
*  The reason the former president was not at his Florida home for today's FBI raid may in fact have been [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=162.0s)]
*  because he was in New York City in preparation for what we're expecting to be a sworn deposition from him very soon [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=168.0s)]
*  in a New York attorney general probe investigating him and his family business on multiple allegations of serious fraud. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=174.0s)]
*  That's a lot of firsts already. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=183.0s)]
*  But today, the former president, Donald Trump, was the subject of an FBI raid on his home in South Florida. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=187.0s)]
*  And historically, it's sort of, you know, it can't be overstated. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=195.0s)]
*  And I do think it is worth pausing and reflecting on the fact today that we do not know where this leads, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=202.0s)]
*  that this is a president who recently, in recent months, has told some of his most rabid followers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=210.0s)]
*  not only that he's still the rightful president of the United States and has been forced out in some sort of unlawful push, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=216.0s)]
*  but he's told them that if any prosecutor anywhere in the country makes an act of furtherance toward him, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=223.0s)]
*  toward potentially prosecuting him for crimes, that he's promised his followers will take to the streets [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=229.0s)]
*  in unprecedented numbers for the kinds of demonstrations the country has never seen before. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=235.0s)]
*  We don't know where this will lead in legal terms. We don't know where this will lead in historic terms. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=240.0s)]
*  We do not know where this will lead in terms of the behavior of the former president and his supporters. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=245.0s)]
*  And that is a moment that is worth appreciating in terms of us being at a historical nexus. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=249.0s)]
*  It is amazing what we have been through with this guy. We have no idea where it goes from here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=259.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uuZprIVKg&t=265.0s)]
