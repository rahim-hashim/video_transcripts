# Focus On Congress To Codify Roe V. Wade Protections Before Rights Are Overturned
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0)
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=0.0s)]
*  She sits on the Judiciary Committee. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=2.96s)]
*  She is absorbing this news just as we all are. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=4.26s)]
*  Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=6.38s)]
*  Let me just get your reaction to this news again. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=8.84s)]
*  The headline tonight in Politico, Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=11.56s)]
*  Draft opinion shows. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=15.76s)]
*  Now, you know, everyone's given you the disclaimers, Rachel, and you—we don't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=17.56s)]
*  know what the final opinion will be. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  But I will say that I have predicted this for a long time based on the court arguments [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=25.6s)]
*  and based on the hearings for these justices. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  I asked Amy Coney Barrett if she thought Roe v. Wade was super precedent. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=33.52s)]
*  She did not think that it was. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And yet, I believe the American people are with us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  So I'd like to focus a bit here on what's going to happen if they do issue this opinion, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=45.52s)]
*  and all signs point to that they will. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=51.08s)]
*  Not just this leak, but what they have said in the past. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=54.32s)]
*  If this is issued, over 20 states, there's a trigger where abortion will automatically [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=60.44s)]
*  be banned. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=66.16s)]
*  So it's no longer going to be a decision between a woman and her doctor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=67.28s)]
*  Basically, I guess Ted Cruz has made this decision for people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=70.92s)]
*  The second thing that we're going to see happen is that you're going to have individual [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=75.32s)]
*  states considering laws banning it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=80.64s)]
*  And meanwhile, in Washington, it's on us now to try to codify Roe v. Wade into law. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=83.28s)]
*  And as you know, we have two Republican senators who are with us when it comes to choice. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=90.4s)]
*  But the question is, with the filibuster in place, which I firmly believe we should reverse, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=97.9s)]
*  could we ever get to 60? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=103.76s)]
*  So this is what we're dealing with right now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=105.72s)]
*  And I cannot overemphasize what a change this is, what a disregard to precedent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=109.27999999999999s)]
*  If this is true, yes, we can be outraged. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  But we also have to plan. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  We are going into election year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  We are going into the fall, where women's rights are going to be on the ballot. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  And so if nothing can get done in Washington because of Republican obstructionism, then [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=129.5s)]
*  the American people and women are going to have to vote and people who believe in choice [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=135.8s)]
*  are going to have to vote like they never voted before, because that's the only way [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=139.76s)]
*  we can change this up or we're going to have a patchwork of laws across the country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=143.74s)]
*  Senator, as you know, one of the things that is most determinative of a woman's economic [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=148.6s)]
*  freedom and self-determination is her ability to make her own decisions about when and if [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=155.56s)]
*  she has kids. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=161.72s)]
*  If that becomes the government's decision, if that is no longer a decision that women [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=163.98s)]
*  are allowed to make for themselves, that fundamentally changes the economic and life and cultural [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=167.72s)]
*  prospects for every woman in the country. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=173.98s)]
*  I wonder if that stark truth about what this does to the future of American womanhood and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=177.38s)]
*  the future of the American family, the future of who we are as a culture, might be enough [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=184.94s)]
*  to scare Republicans in Washington off an effort to do a nationwide ban. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=189.62s)]
*  I mean, as you say, those trigger those trigger laws don't require any action. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=193.74s)]
*  They'll just go into effect in more than 20 states. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=197.22s)]
*  But we have reporting in The Washington Post today that they want a nationwide six week [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=199.58s)]
*  flat ban. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that they might be the dog that catches the car in that case? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  They may be too scared to actually do something that radical. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=207.9s)]
*  Or do you think they just go for it? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, obviously, they're they are not going to be able to pass something like [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=212.06s)]
*  this in the Senate right now because Democrats have the slim 50 50, but we have the majority. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=216.78s)]
*  But I think what you're going to see is a discussion of this in real terms like we've [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=223.26s)]
*  never seen before. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=228.7s)]
*  Back alley abortions, people having to take buses to other states, people not being able, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=230.33999999999997s)]
*  as you said, to make their own economic decisions right as they're coming out of this pandemic, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=235.94s)]
*  where there is so much uncertainty right now and people are just trying to get their grounding. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=241.06s)]
*  And then we're literally stripping the women of this country of their rights. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=246.46s)]
*  If that happens, I think you're going to see repercussions like never before. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=250.62s)]
*  They have basically stacked the court with these judges through various procedural games [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=255.58s)]
*  that they played in the Senate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=261.86s)]
*  And now is the moment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=264.02s)]
*  And the only way this gets decided, if this opinion gets issued as is, it's going to be [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=265.38s)]
*  state by state fights about this with the automatic triggers going in place in many [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=271.38s)]
*  and then is going to be a decision for Congress. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=276.18s)]
*  And it makes the election for the House and the Senate more important than any we've seen [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=279.54s)]
*  in our lifetime when it comes to the protection of women's rights. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=285.54s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Judiciary Committee representing the great state of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  Minnesota. Senator, thank you for your time this evening. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=295.22s)]
*  I know we caught you on short notice. Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=297.38s)]
*  It's great to be on, Rachel. Thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5spx7eQC0&t=299.06s)]
