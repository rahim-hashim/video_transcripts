# 'Astonishing': Search Warrant Reflect's DOJ's Lack Of Trust In Trump: Rosenberg
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70)
*  In the most practical, simple terms, what we know is this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=0.0s)]
*  We know that federal law enforcement authorities would have had to go to a judge and bring [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=3.5s)]
*  to that judge a request for a search warrant. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  In order to get a search warrant from the judge, the authorities would have had to tell [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=12.14s)]
*  the judge where they wanted to search and what they wanted to search for. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=15.56s)]
*  And they would have had to demonstrate to the judge probable cause, that at that location [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  they wanted to search, they would find evidence that a crime was committed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=24.1s)]
*  A federal crime, a specific federal crime, which they would have to spell out in detail [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=28.5s)]
*  to the judge. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=32.82s)]
*  The judge would have to be satisfied in the specificity of the request in terms of the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=34.3s)]
*  location and what they were looking for and in the assertion that there is probable cause [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=37.78s)]
*  to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at that location. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=43.18s)]
*  If the judge was so satisfied, the judge would then agree to sign and authorize the warrant, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=46.7s)]
*  which could then be executed by the FBI within 14 days. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  We know that just as a categorical matter in terms of what today's news implies about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=56.74s)]
*  what's led to this point. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  Now, Kelly O'Donnell reports for NBC News tonight that after the warrant was obtained, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=63.5s)]
*  but before it was served, the FBI notified the Secret Service today that they were going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  to come to Mar-a-Lago today, this morning, in order to execute this search warrant. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=72.62s)]
*  Former President Trump himself tonight confirmed in an online statement that the raid had taken [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=77.9s)]
*  place. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=83.38s)]
*  He also noted in this statement that he felt aggrieved, I guess you'd call it, by the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  search. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  More interestingly, though, he also noted that the execution of the search warrant had [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  included the FBI breaking into his safe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=92.94s)]
*  I mean, depending on the terms of the search warrant, one would expect that a search warrant [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=96.02s)]
*  of this nature might include everything to be found at the property, everything related [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=100.38s)]
*  to the potential crime that the authorities had to assert probable cause about. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=105.78s)]
*  So therefore, breaking into a safe wouldn't be that much more serious and active than [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=111.74s)]
*  the rest of the search itself, but he has volunteered. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  Quote, they even broke into my safe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=118.94s)]
*  So at least if we believe his word, we know that was part of it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=121.5s)]
*  I want to bring now into the conversation Chuck Rosenberg. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=124.14s)]
*  He's a former U.S. attorney, former senior FBI official, and the person who I immediately [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=126.58s)]
*  get in touch with on nights like this to make sure that I've got the legal part of this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  at least under my belt and I can explain it in a way that's going to make sense to other [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=135.48s)]
*  non-lawyers such as myself. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=139.9s)]
*  Chuck, my friend, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=141.5s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=144.02s)]
*  First, let me just get your your top line reaction to this this raid. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=146.66s)]
*  Let me tell me if I've said anything thus far that doesn't strike you as correct in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=151.02s)]
*  terms of the way these procedures work. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=154.74s)]
*  Tell me what you think about the seriousness of this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  So your explanation at the opening of your show was spot on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure why you need me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=162.3s)]
*  I will say this. It's astonishing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=164.46s)]
*  Like, just step back for a moment and recognize that the Department of Justice went to a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=167.22s)]
*  federal judge and got a search warrant for the home of a former president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=171.66s)]
*  I mean, putting aside what's in the affidavit, putting aside what crime they specified, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=176.06s)]
*  putting all that aside, this is not something. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=180.86s)]
*  And this is an understatement that happens lightly at the United States Department of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=183.82s)]
*  Justice. And then one thing I would add, you made this point, but I want to sort of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=188.38s)]
*  amplify it, Rachel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=192.74s)]
*  Two branches of government are involved in a search warrant, the executive branch, the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=194.7s)]
*  FBI and the Department of Justice that asks permission and the judicial branch, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=199.9s)]
*  grants permission. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=204.66s)]
*  So this is not some FBI agent off by herself seeking to search a former president's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=205.98s)]
*  home. Highly scrutinized. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=211.9s)]
*  The most fly-specked affidavit, I suppose, in the history of the United States Department [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=214.42s)]
*  of Justice and then approval by a federal judge. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=219.1s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=223.18s)]
*  Chuck, I started making calls and texting people as soon as the news broke tonight. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=225.1s)]
*  And in addition to yourself, I spoke to another former very high ranking DOJ official who [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=229.5s)]
*  told me a couple of things that I just wanted to run by you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=235.46s)]
*  And this is a person who's not comfortable being identified publicly, but was willing to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=237.62s)]
*  let me characterize their remarks in terms of framing their understanding of what happened [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  here. And the first comment I got from this person jives a little bit with what you just [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=246.98s)]
*  said, that Attorney General Merrick Garland himself would have had to approve this [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=251.86s)]
*  personally. And the official I spoke with also pointed out that Attorney General [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=256.38s)]
*  Garland approving this as a search rather than as a subpoena may be significant in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  that it may mean that the attorney general was convinced that these documents in question [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  were at risk of being destroyed or were potentially at risk of being disseminated to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=274.54s)]
*  third parties, which would further aggravate, worsen the crime here in terms of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=279.26s)]
*  mishandling classified information. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=284.9s)]
*  What do you think about that aspect of this? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=286.86s)]
*  Makes sense to me. First of all, Rachel, a subpoena and a search warrant aren't mutually [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=290.14s)]
*  exclusive. You could execute a search warrant and simultaneously hand the person a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=294.14s)]
*  subpoena for the same records, meaning regardless of where they are, we want them back [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=299.7s)]
*  and that we want them back piece is so important to my other point, to the question you [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  just asked. We want them back means we want them back regardless of how we get them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=310.3s)]
*  And if we have to get a search warrant to get them back, then so be it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=318.14000000000004s)]
*  If you don't trust the person with a subpoena, because a subpoena simply says, hey, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=321.3s)]
*  Rachel, here's a subpoena for your stuff. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=325.26000000000005s)]
*  When you get around to it, or at least by the date that the grand jury is meeting, give [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=327.82000000000005s)]
*  us the stuff. There's indicia of trust, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=331.82s)]
*  You may be under investigation, but we're allowing you to give it to us on your timetable. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=335.86s)]
*  That doesn't happen in a search warrant. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=341.7s)]
*  We need this stuff. We want this stuff. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=343.54s)]
*  The fact that this stuff is out there can do grave damage to the national security of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=345.86s)]
*  the United States. We're not just going to ask you for it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  We're going to take it. And so that's a very big deal. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=352.7s)]
*  So subpoenas and search warrants are not mutually exclusive, but a search warrant is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=355.62s)]
*  the most serious way that the Department of Justice and the FBI can get back something [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=360.94s)]
*  that it needs or wants. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=365.18s)]
*  And again, has to be authorized by a federal judge. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=366.62s)]
*  It's a very big deal. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=369.62s)]
*  And Chuck, if the New York Times reporting is correct, that this is about the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=372.18s)]
*  classified documents, the alleged classified, excuse me, alleged mishandling of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=377.86s)]
*  classified documents reported by the Washington Post, reported as a grand jury [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=382.38s)]
*  matter by the New York Times back in May. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=386.3s)]
*  If that is the basis for this search warrant, number one, if the search warrant turns up [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=389.02000000000004s)]
*  evidence of other crimes, what happens to that information? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=395.82s)]
*  Is that is that also equally sort of in the possession and usable by the Justice [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=399.62s)]
*  Department? But also, is it unusual that for the specific crime of mishandling classified [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=403.98s)]
*  information, you would see a tactic as aggressive as a search warrant as opposed to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=411.18s)]
*  just a subpoena. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=416.54s)]
*  You would see a raid of this magnitude. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=417.78000000000003s)]
*  You would see a former president not afforded informal deference for less intrusive, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=420.62s)]
*  less intrusive means. Mishandling classified information does get prosecuted, but does [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=426.98s)]
*  it get prosecuted in ways like this? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=430.94s)]
*  Yes, and yes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=435.82s)]
*  So mishandling classified information, retaining classified information, at its worst, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=436.98s)]
*  transmitting classified information with the intent to harm the national security of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=442.98s)]
*  the United States. All of those are felonies. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  All of those are crimes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=450.02000000000004s)]
*  Some more serious than others. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=451.54s)]
*  But if you don't trust someone to give you the stuff, then the way you get it back is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=453.70000000000005s)]
*  through a search warrant. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=458.58000000000004s)]
*  That's what's so astonishing here. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=460.62s)]
*  The former president of the United States couldn't be trusted to return it, couldn't be [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=462.70000000000005s)]
*  trusted to return it simply with a subpoena. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=466.98s)]
*  And so to your earlier point, Merrick Garland, who had to be involved in this, it's just [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=469.62s)]
*  it would be remarkable if he were not, had to sign off on a search warrant to go take [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=475.18s)]
*  the stuff. Listen, I handled very classified information, highly classified [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  matters. Lots of stuff in the federal government are overclassified, but there are [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=487.26s)]
*  crown jewels. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=491.62s)]
*  And if those crown jewels get out and in the wrong hands, they can do grave damage to the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  national security of the United States. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=496.98s)]
*  And so if you don't trust someone to return it, Rachel, what do you do? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=499.58000000000004s)]
*  You ask a federal judge for permission to go take it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=502.54s)]
*  Chuck, if I mentioned that in the case of this former president, and it almost feels [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=507.3s)]
*  hyperbolic to say, but I mean it literally, when hearing about the raid by the FBI on [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=512.86s)]
*  his home, you don't automatically know which federal grand jury investigation it might [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=518.5s)]
*  pertain to because he does appear to be potentially implicated in multiple investigations [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=523.1s)]
*  of multiple potential crimes, at least three of which are under separate federal grand [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=528.62s)]
*  jury investigations that have been reported in the press. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=534.86s)]
*  Given that, given the January 6th adjacent investigations, for example, if this search [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=538.58s)]
*  warrant was effectuated about the classified documents investigation, but it turned up [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=546.18s)]
*  material related to other matters for which the president is potentially under federal [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=555.06s)]
*  investigation as well. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=559.8199999999999s)]
*  Are those considered to be properly collected by the Justice Department? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=561.42s)]
*  Do those have to be handed back? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=565.18s)]
*  Is that sort of fair game? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=566.9s)]
*  If they come across things that aren't, that's evidence of crimes for which the, that evidence [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=568.18s)]
*  of crimes that weren't the crime that they went to that federal judge to get this warrant [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=572.86s)]
*  for today? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=576.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=577.34s)]
*  And I apologize to you for making you ask me twice. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=578.58s)]
*  I failed to answer it previously. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=581.34s)]
*  So, yes, if you are lawfully present in the home and you are because a judge authorized [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  the search warrant and you're lawfully taking documents because it's listed in the search [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=590.2600000000001s)]
*  warrant as being potential evidence of the crime that you're investigating, then sure, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=594.94s)]
*  it's all fair game. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  There are a number of doctrines that apply once you're lawfully in a home. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=600.5s)]
*  Plain view would be one of them. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=604.02s)]
*  Now, this is an outlandish example, but if they saw a sawed off shotgun or meth on the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=605.26s)]
*  kitchen table and distribution amounts, you can seize it because it's in plain view. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  But more reasonably and more rationally, if you find other documents that lead you to [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=615.1s)]
*  other investigations or avenues and they're lawfully seized by lawfully present agents. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=620.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, Rachel, fair game. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=626.38s)]
*  Chuck Rosenberg, former senior FBI official and Justice Department official. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=628.5799999999999s)]
*  Chuck, thank you very much for your time this evening. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=631.9799999999999s)]
*  Invaluable as always, but particularly tonight and this historic night. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=634.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=637.4599999999999s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9YuAAGjA70&t=638.78s)]
