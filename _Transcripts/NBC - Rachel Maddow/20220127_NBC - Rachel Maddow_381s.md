# Stalwart Irish Fishermen Uncowed By Russian Threats And Diplomatic Games
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A)
*  So here's the statement. It's from the Russian embassy, Russia's embassy in the nation of Ireland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, any attempts to interfere with military exercises would be a reckless and irresponsible act, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=5.04s)]
*  which could put in harm's way both sailors and fishermen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=11.52s)]
*  What it really was, was a warning for these guys. Fishermen from County Cork, who say they plan to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=15.44s)]
*  disrupt Russia's war games exercises next week, which are scheduled to take place in the waters [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  where they fish, where they make their living. To say these fishermen are undeterred by the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=27.04s)]
*  Russian government's statement about those war games, that would be an understatement. Listen to this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  Are you aware of that? That the Russian embassy is saying your behaviour is reckless? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=39.92s)]
*  How is it reckless to go out in a boat and protest peacefully to say, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  you are not welcome in our waters? How is that reckless? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=52.32s)]
*  They're saying it's not true. How is it reckless that I'm not even going to entertain any Russian [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=55.84s)]
*  embassy or any ambassador whatsoever, Joe? I'll tell you, this is directly to that gentleman there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=60.64s)]
*  If anybody tries to impede my freedom of movement in Irish waters, then they're going to be in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  trouble. They're going to be in trouble. I come back to the statement from the Russian ambassador. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=73.12s)]
*  He said- I have no relationship with the Russian ambassador. I'm a free citizen in Ireland. He has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=77.44s)]
*  no authority over me and I take his threat as an insult. That's my answer to him. That's my answer [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=82.4s)]
*  to the Russian ambassador of Ireland. I take his threat as an insult and he should withdraw it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=90.72s)]
*  I take his threat as an insult and he should withdraw it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=99.84s)]
*  Yesterday, the Russian embassy in Ireland invited the Cork fishermen to come visit, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=106.48s)]
*  to come to their embassy in Dublin and meet with the Russian ambassador to try to talk this out. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=112.08s)]
*  The fishermen agreed to take the meeting. Had I been them, I'm not sure I would have, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=116.48s)]
*  but they went. The head of the Cork Fishermen's Organization offered this preview of what he [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=121.28s)]
*  planned to tell the ambassador when he sat down with him face to face. Is it a fishing ground or [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=126.24s)]
*  is it a firing range? What can the Russian ambassador say to you in the morning that will [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=132.72s)]
*  make you call off your flotilla? We're not calling off our flotilla. We're going out there to fish, Joe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=137.76s)]
*  The fishermen are going out to fish in this area. So why are you going to say to the Russian ambassador? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to explain that to the Russian ambassador. This is where we fish. This is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=147.76s)]
*  where we prosecute a fishery and this is where we're going to fish. We're hoping that if they're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  going to carry out an exercise, they will keep a safe distance from us, not the other way around. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=155.76s)]
*  And if they feel that they need to come into our area where we're fishing, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=160.32s)]
*  our protest is we're not moving. Our protest is we're not moving. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=164.32s)]
*  This small group of Irish fishermen, of course, they are not the only people in the world who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=170.88s)]
*  are upset with Russia right now, right? As Russia uses its military to menace Europe, right? But as [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  far as Russia's military exercises around the edges of that threat go, it does seem like these [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=181.92s)]
*  fishermen in Ireland are the only ones who are actually doing anything about it. This is what the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=188.32s)]
*  head of the Fishermen's Organization told the local press in Cork. He said, quote, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=192.8s)]
*  It is a bit funny that it's up to us, but we will take the opportunity to represent our fishermen [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=196.56s)]
*  at whatever level and whatever way we can. Well, today, two representatives from the Irish [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=201.52s)]
*  fishermen did travel from Cork to Dublin to go meet with the Russian ambassador to Ireland. They [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=207.44s)]
*  met at the embassy. The meeting lasted a little under an hour. And by early accounts, they said [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=212.8s)]
*  the meeting went well. The fishermen came outside after their meeting. They told the press gathered [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=217.52s)]
*  outside the embassy that they felt the ambassador took their concerns seriously. They said they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=221.28s)]
*  felt understood by him. They said they came to a compromise, an agreement that Russia would create [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=225.36s)]
*  a sort of buffer zone between the fishing grounds and their war games, basically an agreement to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=230.88s)]
*  share the waters out there next week so everybody can do their jobs and no one will get hurt. We'll [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=236.4s)]
*  all coexist. The fishermen said Russia gave them a quote, absolute guarantee that their fishing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=240.56s)]
*  grounds would not be disrupted by Russia's military exercises. The embassy even put out this photo of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=247.2s)]
*  the two fishermen with the ambassador. See, everybody's getting along. Everything's fine now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=254.32s)]
*  An absolute guarantee. But well, I mean, here's these fishermen, right? Why is it up to them [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=259.44s)]
*  to negotiate the terms of the Russian Navy's military exercises? And could the Russian [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  government really be dealing with these guys in good faith about this? Expressing what the limits [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=275.92s)]
*  will be, what the buffer zones will be, the guarantee they're giving them about not disrupting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=280.56s)]
*  anything. I mean, I believe the fishermen, when they say the ambassador gave them an absolute guarantee [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  that the fishing grounds would not be disrupted. I believe that the ambassador told them that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  But then, of course, once the fishermen came out of the embassy and said that publicly, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  the Russians claimed that no such thing had happened. This is the headline in the Irish [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=298.8s)]
*  Times, quote, Russian embassy disputes claims of absolute guarantee to Irish fishermen on naval [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=304.08s)]
*  exercise impact. These fishermen are fishermen. They are not trained diplomats. Russia appears to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=309.68s)]
*  be trying to take advantage of that, you know, immediately reneging on whatever promises they [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=318.8s)]
*  may have fed these guys in the room today. So they're yanking these guys chains. I'm sure they feel [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=323.12s)]
*  like, oh, these guys are just fishermen. Who cares? You know, all week as we have been covering the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=327.12s)]
*  story, this back and forth between one of the most powerful navies on earth and these fishermen, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=333.52s)]
*  one thing has stayed constant. These guys are very clear. They are not going to budge. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=338.56s)]
*  Russia's military exercises are supposed to start on Thursday next week. The fishermen say, hey, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=344.08s)]
*  the prawn quota opens up on Tuesday. So we're going to be out there on the water doing our [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=349.28s)]
*  jobs starting on Tuesday. And we're not planning on moving, not for you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s151iGHwV6A&t=353.6s)]
