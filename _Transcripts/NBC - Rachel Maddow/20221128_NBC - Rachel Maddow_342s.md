# Dinner With Trump Boosts Fringe Racist Into Mainstream GOP Politics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys)
*  Joining us now is Kathleen Ballou. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=0.0s)]
*  She teaches history at Northwestern. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=1.84s)]
*  She's the author of Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement, and Paramilitary America, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=3.4s)]
*  which is a seminal text in this field. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=8.4s)]
*  Professor Ballou, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=10.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank you for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you about my job in this, in my role in this, and the role of our conversation [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=18.16s)]
*  about this, because I feel like one of the things that I've learned from your scholarship [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=23.84s)]
*  and from the field in which you've contributed so much is to understand that when you get [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  ultra-right, violent, white power movements adjacent to people with real political power, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=32.2s)]
*  yes, it may be worth looking at how they influence people with real political power, but one [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=38.2s)]
*  of the more, perhaps more immediate impact is that it tends to supercharge and promote [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=43.56s)]
*  and help do their work. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=50.6s)]
*  These people who are on the far, far ultra-right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=53.2s)]
*  And I don't want to be part of that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=57.88s)]
*  I don't want to amplify this guy's message, but I feel like Trump just put him in a new [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  level of the sort of stratosphere in terms of its political influence. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=66.92s)]
*  And we can talk about that without saying his name or directing people to his websites [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  or anything like that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  I think the issue here, if we step back a moment from sort of the news cycle part of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=73.68s)]
*  this and think about how it sits in a broader historical context is that this is an activist [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=78.92s)]
*  that Trump is claiming not to know, even though this person was involved in the Unite the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, was involved in January 6th. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=89.88s)]
*  This is a long time player. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=93.84s)]
*  So I mean, the claims not to know who he is are, I mean, specious at best. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=96.64s)]
*  But the bigger point here is what this kind of a meeting unlocks for the future, because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=102.32s)]
*  I think the only place I would take issue with your opening monologue, which was excellent [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=109.44s)]
*  as always, but is the idea that that this movement would like Trump to be the dictator. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they'll take him because he's there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=119.72s)]
*  But Trump is not the point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=121.96s)]
*  The point is the seizure of power. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  The point is the white ethnostate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=126.28s)]
*  The point is all of that violence against populations that are targeted by this movement [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=128.23999999999998s)]
*  that is unleashed right now in a sort of ad hoc fashion, but that would be unleashed in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=133.23999999999998s)]
*  a much more systematic way if and when these people begin to amass political power. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  So what we have to think about is not only Trump, but also all of the other people in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=143.16s)]
*  the GOP who have been shoulder to shoulder with this particular activist, including [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=148.56s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, including several others and and the people who are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=154.0s)]
*  also presumptive nominees in 2024 who have not taken the opportunity to decry this meeting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=160.32s)]
*  I saw that Mike Pence did eventually today and OK, perhaps there's a delay because of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=168.4s)]
*  the holiday weekend. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=172.64s)]
*  But the fact that the GOP is not coming out full throatedly against this is a notable [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=173.96s)]
*  escalation in how much they are allowing extremist politics to shape the party. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=181.0s)]
*  If Republican politicians aren't playing enough of a sort of gatekeeper role on this, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=186.8s)]
*  if they are not quickly and uniformly and unequivocally condemning the sort of thing, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=192.16s)]
*  which I hear you would would make a difference in terms of how much space is kind of unlocked [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=197.16s)]
*  for these groups to operate in on the right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=202.0s)]
*  Is there anything else that the rest of the country can do to try to mitigate the harm [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=205.0s)]
*  that's caused by this type of embrace by a figure like Trump? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=210.28s)]
*  I mean, the list of action needed is long and extensive. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=214.92s)]
*  One of the big ones is I think I've seen not only in the news media, but on Twitter [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=219.08s)]
*  and in personal conversation this sense that because these sort of big lie candidates were [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=223.88s)]
*  were pushed back in the midterms and Trump didn't do as well as he had hoped. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=230.76s)]
*  And maybe the announcement was lackluster. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=234.52s)]
*  Perhaps we're out of the woods. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=237.04s)]
*  And one thing just to remember about the white power movement, particularly, is that they [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=238.6s)]
*  probably don't care that much at all who the dictator is. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=243.92s)]
*  Trump being out of power would not stop this groundswell. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=248.48s)]
*  This is now a social problem that we all face, regardless of what's going on in sort of what [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=251.62s)]
*  did you call it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=259.32s)]
*  World one, planet one of normal politics as usual, whatever is going on over there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=260.32s)]
*  We now live in a world where these activists are emboldened. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=264.68s)]
*  They're showing up to pride parades and school board meetings. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=269.2s)]
*  They're targeting our communities. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=272.0s)]
*  Their acts of violence like the ones in Buffalo, but also much smaller and equally devastating [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=273.56s)]
*  acts of violence very regularly in our society. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=279.44s)]
*  This is going to take a full scale social response that is not just about politics. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=282.9s)]
*  It's about do we care about harm to one another or do we accept it? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=290.9s)]
*  Kathleen Ballew is an associate professor of history at Northwestern, the author of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  a very important book that everybody should read, which is called Bring the War Home, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=300.58s)]
*  the White Power Movement and Paramilitary America. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=303.46s)]
*  I have it in hardback and in paperback because I read it first when it first came out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=305.82s)]
*  And then I have read it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=309.78s)]
*  I have reread it and consulted with it so many times. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=310.78s)]
*  I wanted a lighter copy of it to carry around. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  Professor Ballew, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=315.26s)]
*  Thank you for your work. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for talking to us tonight. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkzGoBuzys&t=319.22s)]
