# 'Exciting, blustering nutjobs': Money problems, chaos seen in state Republican Parties
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg)
*  Where we start tonight is now in our current day in the great state of Minnesota, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=0.0s)]
*  a reporter for the conservative National Review magazine recently wrote, quote, For the price [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=7.04s)]
*  of a new Xbox game, you too can own your very own state party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=11.92s)]
*  And it turns out that is sort of true. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=19.92s)]
*  Madden NFL 23 for Xbox One is $59.99. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=22.64s)]
*  The game Farming Simulator 22, that's an Xbox game, that one costs $49.99. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=27.94s)]
*  Star Wars Jedi Survivor is $52.49. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=34.36s)]
*  If you are willing and able to shell out that kind of money roughly for an Xbox game, let [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=40.54s)]
*  me tell you, National Review is right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=46.22s)]
*  You are right in the ballpark for what it would take to buy out all the cash assets [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  of the Republican Party of the great state of Minnesota. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=54.5s)]
*  The state Republican Party in Minnesota recently reported that its bank accounts are currently [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=58.06s)]
*  flush with a grand total of $53.81. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  So that is $1.32 more than the Star Wars game costs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=68.94s)]
*  But for Farming Simulator, it's actually a deal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=75.18s)]
*  You could cash in all the cash assets of the Minnesota Republican Party, and with that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=78.14s)]
*  money you could get the $49.99 Farming Simulator game plus almost $4 change, which means you, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=83.68s)]
*  in addition to that Xbox Farming Simulator, you could buy some Cheetos. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=91.2s)]
*  Not the big bag of Cheetos, not party size, but a pretty good size one, especially if [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=94.84s)]
*  it were on sale. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  Why does the Republican Party of the state of Minnesota have less than $60 in its bank [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=101.12s)]
*  account? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=107.12s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=109.76s)]
*  But the Daily Beast was first to report it, and the details actually only get worse from [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=112.36s)]
*  there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=117.12s)]
*  In addition to having less than $60 to its name, the Republican Party of Minnesota also [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=118.12s)]
*  reportedly has over $330,000 in debt, which it needs to pay off, which it will not be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=123.2s)]
*  able to pay off with less than $60 cash in its bank account. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=130.36s)]
*  So that does not seem good. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=133.32s)]
*  It also, it turns out, is not an isolated story. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=134.88s)]
*  The same sort of thing, or at least a variation on this sort of thing, is happening in a whole [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  bunch of key states for Republicans right now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  In Colorado, for example, the Colorado Sun was first to report that that state's Republican [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  Party was so broke that it has stopped paying its employees and that it is unable to pay [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=150.28s)]
*  rent on its office space. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  The deputy chief of the Republic, excuse me, of the Colorado House Republican Party told [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=161.44s)]
*  the Colorado Sun that the Colorado State Republican Party very simply is bankrupt. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=166.6s)]
*  Now, I don't know if there's a connection, but I should also tell you that the Colorado [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=172.84s)]
*  Republican Party is planning to vote next week to simply cancel the 2024 Republican [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=176.04s)]
*  primary in Colorado. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=182.72s)]
*  If you don't have enough money to pay your rent or your staffers and your bankrupt, I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=185.16s)]
*  guess something's got to go. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=188.48s)]
*  Why not your basic function as a party? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=189.88s)]
*  In Arizona, the messenger news outlet was first to report that Arizona's State Republican [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=193.76s)]
*  Party reported in its federal election filings that it has only about $23,000 in the bank [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=202.2s)]
*  in total. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=209.28s)]
*  And that might be enough to trade for a new Hyundai Elantra, but only as long as you don't [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=210.32s)]
*  want one with cruise control. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  For all the trouble with the Arizona Republican Party being that broke, I should tell you [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=217.84s)]
*  that the party's highest profile, Trump-supporting election denier politician, Arizona Republican [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=223.48s)]
*  Party's failed gubernatorial candidate, Carrie Lake, she's heading soon to another state, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=229.56s)]
*  to Michigan, to help Michigan's Republican Party raise some money. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=235.44s)]
*  You'd think that she might be able to help out at home, but no, she's going to Michigan [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=239.28s)]
*  to help them raise money. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=242.16s)]
*  That was just reported today by the Detroit News. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=243.28s)]
*  That said, maybe it's needed help. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=247.32s)]
*  Even with Arizona being as broke as it is, look, in Michigan, they got trouble too. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  The Michigan State Republican Party is broke as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=254.76s)]
*  They reported $93,000 total in their bank accounts. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=257.36s)]
*  And that comes in Michigan as 16 Michigan Republicans, including the former former state [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=262.4s)]
*  party co-chair, are now facing multiple felony charges for having submitted themselves as [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=267.52s)]
*  forged electors, as Michigan electors in the presidential race in 2020, even though [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=273.98s)]
*  they really weren't, because Joe Biden won that state, not Donald Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=279.18s)]
*  We don't yet know if other people who participated in the fake electors scheme for Trump in other [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=285.06s)]
*  states are going to be charged as well the way they've been charged in Michigan. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=290.1s)]
*  But Georgia's one of the states where that is a possibility. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=295.06s)]
*  In Georgia, we know that a bunch of Republicans who participated in the fake electors scheme, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=297.74s)]
*  they received target letters from the prosecutor's office in that state, Fannie Willis's office, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  as she investigates various efforts to throw out Georgia's election results and falsely [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=308.3s)]
*  proclaim Trump the winner. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution was first to report that this is also turning out to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  be an expensive prospect for the state Republican Party in Georgia. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  Georgia's state Republican Party agreed to pay the legal bills for those fake electors. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=323.74s)]
*  And in so doing, Georgia's state Republican Party saddled themselves with a remarkable [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=328.34s)]
*  financial burden. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=332.94s)]
*  Already in the first half of this year, the party spent like over a half million dollars [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=334.7s)]
*  on this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=339.46s)]
*  It spent five times what it spent on all the party's annual legal expenses combined as [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=340.9s)]
*  recently as 2021. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=346.78s)]
*  And we're only halfway through the year thus far. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  In the first half of 2023, they've spent five times what they spent on all legal expenses [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=352.58s)]
*  for everything as recently as 2021. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=358.18s)]
*  And that was for the whole year. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=360.74s)]
*  That's a lot of states with a lot of financial drama. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=364.7s)]
*  And these are not state Republican parties in like, forgive me, sort of, you know, obscure [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=367.5s)]
*  states where things are never going to be contested. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=372.42s)]
*  I mean, Minnesota, Colorado, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, that's like the table of contents [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=374.74s)]
*  for places Republicans want to show what they can do in this next election cycle and the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  one after that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=386.26s)]
*  But all of them and all those states, they're broke or they're spending themselves into [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=388.26s)]
*  oblivion. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=392.74s)]
*  I started by saying that the National Review compared the assets of the Minnesota State [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=393.74s)]
*  Republican Party to the price of a single Xbox game. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  That same conservative publication recently looked at this dire financial picture in multiple [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=404.5s)]
*  states and said this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=409.38s)]
*  They said, quote, If Republicans are disappointed with the results of the 2024 elections for [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=411.18s)]
*  the fourth straight cycle, mind you, a key factor will be the replacement of competent, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=416.74s)]
*  boring, regular state party officials with quite exciting blustering nut jobs who have [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=421.78000000000003s)]
*  little or no interest in the basics of successfully managing a state party or the basic blocking [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=428.42s)]
*  and tackling involved in helping GOP candidates win elections. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=433.22s)]
*  Quite exciting blustering nut jobs. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=438.86s)]
*  Couldn't have said it better myself. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=441.74s)]
*  But that's where we are. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=444.94s)]
*  With the state Republican parties in five more or less crucial states, either in dire [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=447.68s)]
*  financial straits or with crippling financial commitments to people charged with Trump related [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=452.28s)]
*  crimes or just outright bankrupt. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=456.82s)]
*  We've got a Republican presidential primary that mathematically isn't even worth watching, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=459.46s)]
*  let alone polling at this point. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=463.3s)]
*  At a California State Republican Party meeting this weekend, the LA Times reports that police [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=464.62s)]
*  had to be called in to avert fistfights between two different Republican factions. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=469.54s)]
*  What's adorable about this story is the nature of the fight. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=474.58s)]
*  At the behest of the Trump campaign, the California Republican Party tried to change the rules [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=477.78s)]
*  of its presidential primary to benefit Trump. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=482.9s)]
*  Trump's campaign basically told the California Republican Party to change the rules of its [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  primary so that Trump would be all but guaranteed to get every single one of the delegates out [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  of California. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=498.97999999999996s)]
*  The California Republican Party asked to do this by the Trump campaign, said, yes, sir, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=500.34s)]
*  absolutely. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  How high? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=505.65999999999997s)]
*  But some of the even more radical Trump supporters in that party convinced themselves that in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  the various scheme must be a foot to trick them, that of course that's what they want [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=511.5s)]
*  you to think. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=515.5s)]
*  And so they, you know, put on their tinfoil hats and made their little signs about the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=516.5s)]
*  Illuminati or whatever and marched on the meeting and fights broke out and the cops [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=521.54s)]
*  had to be called to break it up. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2RMiM0CzAg&t=527.7s)]
