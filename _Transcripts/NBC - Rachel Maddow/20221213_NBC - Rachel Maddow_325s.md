# Meet The Most Powerful Pro-Democracy Group You Never Heard Of
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA)
*  This is from politico.com this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=0.0s)]
*  This is brand new news to me and to you and to everyone. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  Totally new. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=6.36s)]
*  Headline was, inside the secret $32 million effort [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=7.2s)]
*  to stop Stop the Steal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=10.44s)]
*  Quote, a pair of progressive organizations [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=13.9s)]
*  operating in complete secrecy spearheaded a $32 million [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=15.76s)]
*  campaign during the midterms to push back [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  against former President Donald Trump's Stop the Steal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=22.44s)]
*  movement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=25.04s)]
*  The groups operated in states across the country [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=25.76s)]
*  as the election system faced unprecedented pressure [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=27.92s)]
*  from Trump and his allies, who falsely said the 2020 election [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=30.64s)]
*  was stolen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=33.52s)]
*  The veteran progressive operative behind the group [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  says, quote, it was very clear that there [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  was a mobilized constituency that cared about democracy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=38.44s)]
*  in this election cycle, but it was on the wrong side. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=41.64s)]
*  Donnelly said the goal of his funding network [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=45.72s)]
*  was to bring people to the fight, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=47.74s)]
*  not just bring more policy wonks or bring more lawyers, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=49.160000000000004s)]
*  to bring more people to the fight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=52.64s)]
*  We decided it wasn't going to be enough just [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  to fund a bunch of election protection efforts [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=57.04s)]
*  or fund a bunch of candidates to run against election deniers. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=59.16s)]
*  He said, we needed to fund organization infrastructure [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  to bring more heft to the battles on democracy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=65.4s)]
*  More heft, tens of millions of dollars of more heft. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is David Donnelly, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  veteran progressive operative behind the Pro-Democracy Center [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=75.64s)]
*  and Pro-Democracy Campaign, which [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  I have to check against my notes, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=81.4s)]
*  because indeed, these are organizations I had never [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=82.78s)]
*  heard of before today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=85.08s)]
*  Mr. Donnelly, thank you for being here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=86.48s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  Can you put a little bit of meat on the bones [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  here in terms of what exactly you funded? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=93.28s)]
*  This is a lot of money to have put into this election cycle. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=96.28s)]
*  What were you funding and what were your priorities? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=100.36s)]
*  First, let me say that I believe there's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=103.48s)]
*  a cast of thousands of people who [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  helped to deliver these election results all across the country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=108.56s)]
*  I think Americans stood up for democracy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=112.2s)]
*  and against those that would take us in the wrong direction [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=115.0s)]
*  and restrict democracy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=117.68s)]
*  The kind of work that our partners did, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=120.4s)]
*  and frankly, I think a whole lot of credit [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=122.6s)]
*  belongs to the 126 groups that we supported, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=125.72s)]
*  the kind of work they did spanned the spectrum [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=129.04s)]
*  from voter registration drives to turning out votes [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=131.2s)]
*  all across the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=136.6s)]
*  They advocated with election clerks [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=138.6s)]
*  to make sure that there are longer hours to cast ballots. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=141.44s)]
*  They encouraged people to reach out to neighbors [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=145.0s)]
*  and to expand the voting rolls. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=149.68s)]
*  And they worked on ballot questions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  And they worked on other kinds of policy fights [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=155.84s)]
*  to make our democracy more reflective and responsive [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=157.8s)]
*  to all of us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=160.84s)]
*  The thing that, well, there's two things that seem notable [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=162.88s)]
*  about this effort and the way that we're learning about it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  One is that this does not seem to have been a, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=168.56s)]
*  let's create a big new national organization that's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  going to train operatives centrally and then dispatch [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=175.96s)]
*  them into the states, which I think is a lot of what we sort [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=179.52s)]
*  of imagine a big well-funded national tens of millions [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  of dollars effort might be like. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  This is very much supporting existing organizations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  in states and communities. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=190.56s)]
*  So I'd like to ask you about that as a strategy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  But the other reason that I'm talking to you tonight [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  and the other reason that I think this is getting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=197.76s)]
*  a lot of attention today is that we did not know [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=199.08s)]
*  about this until after the election was over. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=200.68s)]
*  Why was this such a low profile effort? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=202.72s)]
*  Why were there no public announcements about this? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=205.2s)]
*  Why aren't we finding about it until now? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  We just simply didn't believe that we should promote work [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=210.56s)]
*  before we did it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=213.48s)]
*  We're under the impression that you should actually [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=214.84s)]
*  go prove yourself in the world before you claim any credit [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=217.32s)]
*  for the work that you've done. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=223.0s)]
*  And we thought that the, our organizational partners [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=224.04s)]
*  in the states were the ones that were doing the hard work [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=227.84s)]
*  and they're the ones that should be talking about their work. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=229.52s)]
*  And many of them got great press coverage about all the work [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=231.4s)]
*  that they did to engage in black and brown communities [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=234.6s)]
*  and young voters and the work that they did on policy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=237.76s)]
*  And we think that's a more important story to tell [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=240.8s)]
*  than the work that we did. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=243.2s)]
*  And we did work within the existing organizational [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=246.68s)]
*  structures, we didn't set up a whole lot of new organizations [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=250.88s)]
*  because there are great organizations working [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=253.2s)]
*  in communities all over the country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=255.88s)]
*  They needed more resources. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=258.36s)]
*  There's a, I did a deep dive in the states in the summer [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=260.16s)]
*  of 21 to hear from leaders of local organizations [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=265.24s)]
*  and statewide organizations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=269.4s)]
*  And there was an appetite to work on democracy [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=270.64s)]
*  on the, over the long-term, but there was also a fear [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=274.08s)]
*  that unless they got to work urgently to tackle [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=277.04s)]
*  and to beat back the attacks against their ability [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=280.76s)]
*  to cast ballots, then we're gonna not even have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=285.16s)]
*  the long-term to fight for. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=288.56s)]
*  So we set out to help support them in the near term, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  but also to lay the groundwork for these organizations [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=293.8s)]
*  that are working in black and brown communities [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  and among young people to have a stronger leadership role [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=299.24s)]
*  on the questions of democracy over time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjVNZ1EvdkA&t=302.88s)]
