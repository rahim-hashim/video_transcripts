# 'Be angry, but don't give up': Trump opposition begins to find its footing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs)
*  This is the ability for the executive branch to literally seize power, storm into the offices [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=0.0s)]
*  of an agency that they hate, and shut it down operationally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=8.84s)]
*  That's not our system of government. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=13.48s)]
*  And that's why we're going to be fighting all night about this issue. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=15.24s)]
*  Democrats have been holding the floor on the U.S. Senate all day today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=20.64s)]
*  They started at 2 17 p.m. Eastern time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=23.84s)]
*  This is a live look at the Senate floor right now, where Virginia Senator Tim Kaine is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=27.16s)]
*  taking his term at the podium. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=30.68s)]
*  But it has been all day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=32.64s)]
*  They have not given up the floor. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=33.72s)]
*  You heard Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii say there at the top that they're going to be [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=35.68s)]
*  fighting all night about this issue. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=39.92s)]
*  The issue, as they're defining it, is a guy named Russell Vote, who's Trump's nominee [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=42.64s)]
*  for White House budget director. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=46.64s)]
*  Vote is the chief proponent of the theory that Donald Trump can essentially eliminate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Congress's role in the U.S. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=53.68s)]
*  government and defund anything they say to do on his own say so, even though that's not [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=55.32s)]
*  how the U.S. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=60.72s)]
*  government works. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=61.48s)]
*  Well, tonight, Democrats are using the rules of the Senate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=63.2s)]
*  They're using the rights of the Senate minority to take up as much time as they humanly can [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=65.52s)]
*  to slow down votes nomination as much as they possibly can. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=70.76s)]
*  The other point of what they're doing here, of course, is to draw the American people's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  attention to just how radical this nominee is and why he should not be confirmed and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=79.28s)]
*  why what he proposes as our new form of U.S. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=84.2s)]
*  government would not be the democracy and the and the tripartite split system of government [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  that makes us who we are. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=93.28s)]
*  The first Democratic senator to announce he would really throw his body into the gears [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=96.08s)]
*  of the government like this was Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=99.64s)]
*  Earlier this week, he said he would block all State Department nominations until Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=102.2s)]
*  reversed his act on reversed his attack on U.S. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=106.48s)]
*  humanitarian aid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=110.44s)]
*  Now, tonight, right now, individual other Senate Democrats have followed that strategy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=112.72s)]
*  Senator Chuck Schumer is suggesting to Democrats that they should be taking that strategy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=118.88s)]
*  broadly with all Trump nominees. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=122.64s)]
*  And tonight, holding the Senate floor, they're really taking this strategy with shots first [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=124.52s)]
*  announced and and and running with it as far as they possibly can. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Joining us now from the Senate is Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=133.32s)]
*  Senator Schatz, I appreciate you stepping off the floor and being with us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=138.0s)]
*  I know it's been a long day and it's going to be a long night. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=140.68s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel, for covering this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=143.44s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=144.8s)]
*  Let me ask how you and your colleagues are holding up and and what what ultimately you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=146.44s)]
*  think will be the the result of holding this floor all evening tonight? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=151.6s)]
*  Well, we're fine. There's going to be 37 of us talking. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=156.16s)]
*  We will not relinquish the floor for 30 hours until the final vote on Mr. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=158.64s)]
*  Russ Vote. And you've said it exactly right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=164.0s)]
*  Russ Vote is an unusual office of management and budget nominee. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=165.92s)]
*  This is a job you shouldn't know the name of the person running the OMB, but he is the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=169.88s)]
*  he's actually one of the authors of Project 2025 and he has a very specific view of OMB. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=174.88s)]
*  He basically thinks the OMB director should be the king's hand and represent the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=180.56s)]
*  president in all things throughout the government, legislative, executive branch, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=186.08s)]
*  wherever. He was the architect of the federal funding freeze that happened last week [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  where Medicaid portals were shut down, where Head Start was shut down, where construction [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=194.96s)]
*  projects were shut down. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=199.12s)]
*  And he's got a lot more ideas for the American people and none of them are good. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  He also basically views laws as optional. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=206.24s)]
*  We pass an appropriations bill and then he thinks that he gets to just say, well, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=210.08s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't like it, so we're going to shut shutter that agency. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, if you don't like a particular part of the federal government, there is a way to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=217.44s)]
*  change the federal government. And it's through your elected representatives in Congress. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=222.2s)]
*  And I don't mean to be so fussy about these kinds of things, but this is the American [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=226.64s)]
*  system of democracy. So there's two problems with Russ Vote. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  One is that what he proposes to do and what they have already done is illegal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=233.44s)]
*  And the other is that what they are doing is already harming people across the country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=238.44s)]
*  The first part of that, the illegal part of that, I think is sticking in everybody's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=242.76s)]
*  craw because it used to be when credible people who know the law pointed out that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=246.6s)]
*  something is illegal. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=253.0s)]
*  It was part of a sentence in which you were saying, you can't do that because it's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  illegal. What we're seeing over and over again in this second Trump term, particularly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=258.88s)]
*  from ideas that sprung from the brain of people like Russ Vote, is that they are doing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=263.36s)]
*  things that seem plainly illegal and yet they are still doing them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=268.0s)]
*  I think the frustration and the exasperation of the American people on that front is that I think we all [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=274.68s)]
*  thought that the law would stop them, would sort of enjoin them from doing things that are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=280.68s)]
*  against the law. How should we understand that tension, that lack of what's allowed them to do this stuff that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=284.84s)]
*  feels so lawless? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=293.12s)]
*  Be angry, but don't give up, because what they want you to believe is that the law doesn't apply to them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=294.64s)]
*  Now, it's true that if they flood the zone and violate the law in multiple areas, it actually takes time for [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=301.0s)]
*  the court system to stop them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=308.4s)]
*  But last week, there was an injunction that was made final this week against the spending [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=310.28s)]
*  freeze. They also rejected the United States government's stupid argument about birthright [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=316.88s)]
*  citizenship. So one of the things that we need to do is not concede that this president and this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=322.6s)]
*  president only is unconstrained by the law. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  He's going to try to violate the law in multiple places. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  But we have to not concede the point that when he writes an EO saying, for instance, I'm going to get rid of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  the Department of Education or the Bureau of Indian Education or the USA Department, like he can't do that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  He may be able to do tons of damage in the meantime, but eventually most, if not all of these things will be [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  overturned in a court of law and they've got to follow it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=351.92s)]
*  It's also true, and you know this, Rachel, that the courts are tilted in Donald Trump's favor. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=354.8s)]
*  But that's when it's a relatively close call, when there is a clear statute that they're violating. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=359.88s)]
*  Even conservative judges and justices have batted them down. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=365.12s)]
*  So we need to be furious. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=369.32s)]
*  We need to be alarmed. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=371.36s)]
*  But we need not to be despondent and act as if this person has already been installed as a monarch. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=373.0s)]
*  We've got to fight. We've got to be vigilant. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  We've got to understand what happened in places like Belarus and elsewhere and Turkey. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=380.76s)]
*  But we cannot give up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  It's way too early to give up. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=387.12s)]
*  And one of the things that gives me the most hope over the last week is that people are starting to show up in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  three dimensions at the Treasury building across the state of Hawaii, across the country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=394.28s)]
*  It's not the resistance. It's not going to be pink hats again. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=400.44s)]
*  It's not going to be the same vibe. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  But there is a citizen movement now to take our country back. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=404.52s)]
*  And once we're starting to see each other, we're starting to think, OK, it's going to take people in the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=408.20000000000005s)]
*  legislative branch fighting. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=412.76000000000005s)]
*  It's going to take smarter political operatives. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=414.32s)]
*  It's going to take people in the media. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  It's going to take people in the civil service refusing to obey illegal orders. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=417.92s)]
*  And it's going to take citizens everywhere supporting all of those efforts. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=422.92s)]
*  Well, your fury and your alarm on this led you to say that Democrats needed to be doing more than they were [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=428.04s)]
*  already doing. They need to be taking more extreme measures. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  You have been pushing your own party to take the kind of steps that you're taking tonight with leading this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=437.6s)]
*  effort in the Senate. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=441.76s)]
*  And for that, you unfortunately are going to be cursed with lots more invitations to be on cable news. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=443.36s)]
*  So say yes more often, Senator. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=449.08s)]
*  We need you at times like this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=451.24s)]
*  Thank you for being here tonight. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=452.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=454.0s)]
*  All right, Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=455.36s)]
*  Again, Democrats holding the floor tonight as we speak. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=457.52s)]
*  They're planning on doing so around the clock overnight to try to fight back as hard as they can to try to make [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=460.48s)]
*  it as annoying as possible and as slow as possible to get Russell vote confirmed as the budget director. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=465.84s)]
*  This is happening right now live in the Senate in Washington, D.C. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=471.68s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6HrKIclLs&t=474.48s)]
