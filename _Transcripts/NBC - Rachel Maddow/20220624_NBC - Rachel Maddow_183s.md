# Thomas Announces Targeting Of Gay Rights; Tacit New Direction To Anti-Abortion Movement
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY)
*  Justice Thomas today and his concurrent spelled out the rights that he wants thrown out next [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=0.0s)]
*  beyond abortion, now that they've taken care of Roe. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=4.5s)]
*  He wants Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell, in his words, reconsidered, which means he [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=7.2s)]
*  wants them overthrown. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Those three cases are about contraception, consensual sex between adults and same-sex [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  marriage, which means next on Clarence Thomas' list are to get rid of all of those things. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=19.6s)]
*  If you are in the same-sex marriage, this may be the time to start thinking about duplicative [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=25.1s)]
*  legal arrangements to protect you and your spouse, your family, your kids, your property, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=29.18s)]
*  your finances. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=34.48s)]
*  If this court moves quickly on Justice Thomas' list of what rights they're going to abolish [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=35.78s)]
*  next, being in a same-sex marriage now means there is a target on you from this court, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=41.28s)]
*  and this court has proven themselves to be absolutely unconstrained, not only by precedent, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=47.68s)]
*  not only by consistency with their previous reasoning, but by any concern for public opinion. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  Take that seriously. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=58.38s)]
*  Tactically, that notice from Justice Thomas today lining up all of those other rights [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=61.68s)]
*  he's ready to get rid of now next, I believe that will have a practical effect on this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=66.98s)]
*  political movement from which he and his colleagues have emerged. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=71.98s)]
*  He's put out that list now, what they're going to go after next. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=74.78s)]
*  He put it in writing in his concurrence today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=77.68s)]
*  Watch for action in response to that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=79.98s)]
*  Watch for people involved in this political movement to start teeing up cases to get them [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=82.18s)]
*  to Justice Thomas to get the job done on marriage rights. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=87.18s)]
*  Watch for a county clerk somewhere to refuse a license to a couple trying to get married [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=90.98s)]
*  in order to start court proceedings that would put marriage back in front of this court. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=96.28s)]
*  Watch for somebody who works at a health facility somewhere to refuse to process a prescription [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=101.18s)]
*  or an order for contraception, for an IUD, for the pill, and again, to start litigation, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=105.78s)]
*  to start legal proceedings, which will eventually put access to contraception before this court. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=111.98s)]
*  They have asked for it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=116.88s)]
*  The movement they come from will give them that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=118.08s)]
*  Watch for Texas or another Republican controlled state to bring back its sodomy law to control [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=120.88s)]
*  with whom you are allowed to have sex and how. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=126.58s)]
*  They'll try to bring back that law. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=130.68s)]
*  It will start legal proceedings that will eventually be designed to put sodomy laws [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=132.48s)]
*  back in front of this court. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=137.48s)]
*  They have asked for it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  The movement they come from will give them that opportunity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  They are unconstrained in seeking to change the country in these ways. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=142.58s)]
*  I mean, for them, the dam is burst. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  What do you see in their behavior that would give you any reason to believe that they see [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=150.68s)]
*  a reason to stop? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4Rr4QVxcaY&t=154.48000000000002s)]
