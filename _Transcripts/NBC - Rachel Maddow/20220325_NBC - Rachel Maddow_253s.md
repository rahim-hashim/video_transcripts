# Polish Schools Open Their Doors To Displaced Ukrainian Students
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE)
*  Poland is not just taking refugees from Ukraine in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=0.0s)]
*  This nation is offering those refugees housing, money and medical care. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=3.24s)]
*  And for the children coming here from Ukraine, Poland is offering schooling and with that, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=8.08s)]
*  a sense of normalcy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=12.74s)]
*  Class is in session. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=18.62s)]
*  These are Ukrainian students learning Polish. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=22.94s)]
*  A lesson that you can see belies just how quickly these high schoolers have had to grow [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=25.779999999999998s)]
*  up since fleeing their home country weeks ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=30.82s)]
*  I just miss my city so much. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=33.82s)]
*  If you will be my friend, you will just, you will have to see my 100 messages about how [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=35.78s)]
*  I want to my home, how I miss my city because it won't stop it, or just like that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=42.94s)]
*  I need to wait two months before I go to my home. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  It's destroyed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=51.86s)]
*  It destroyed all my city. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=52.86s)]
*  It's, I was in home when, when bomb passed in the house near mine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=54.46s)]
*  I just saw the noise and it's so crazy and strange. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  By contrast, the routine of school is a welcome relief. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=67.54s)]
*  I like this lesson very much. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=71.26s)]
*  Thank you to all the people that helped. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=72.42s)]
*  From gym class to the lunch room, new friendships are forming. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=75.22s)]
*  Sometimes the presence is, is the most that we can give and the most important thing that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=82.98s)]
*  they, that they get from us because they need it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=91.7s)]
*  They left their families in Ukraine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  So every, every way of help is needed, is much needed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=101.26s)]
*  They need friends. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=107.54s)]
*  They want to talk. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=108.54s)]
*  They want to integrate with us and feel like normal teenagers. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  And the city wants them to feel welcome too. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=115.42s)]
*  On every Warsaw lamp post are Ukrainian flags welcoming them here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  Warsaw is a city of about 1.76 million people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=123.18s)]
*  Recent estimates are that about 300,000 refugees have come to this city. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  That's a 17% increase in the population. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=131.06s)]
*  About half of those refugees are children. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=133.82s)]
*  So despite all the social services that are being offered to these refugees, local officials [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=136.14s)]
*  say it's not enough. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=139.94s)]
*  You told me that the Polish students are doing a great job. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  The parents of the students are doing a great job and the people in the community are helping [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=145.77999999999997s)]
*  you a lot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=149.38s)]
*  Still, you say you need more. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=150.38s)]
*  We have to provide apartments for these kids because some of them are sleeping in a room [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  with 10 or 20 people on the mattress. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=160.33999999999997s)]
*  We need more financing to give them breakfasts and to give them dinners. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=164.58s)]
*  If the number of kids in Poland grow and schools grow by one fold, it's a huge burden. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=171.78s)]
*  Poland is not such a wealthy country to take care of it by ourselves. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  Andrzej Wieroszemski is the school's headmaster. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=186.5s)]
*  He tells me he thinks the other EU countries need to step up to help Poland financially. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=189.78s)]
*  And in Poland, there's a lot to finance. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=195.48s)]
*  Here huge lines are seen each day as refugees line up for a government ID number. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=199.5s)]
*  Like a social security number in the United States, it guarantees them the right to work, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=205.1s)]
*  free health care and education. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=209.98s)]
*  And for the students receiving that education, while starting in Polish school may feel like [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=212.34s)]
*  starting over, they don't intend to let the challenge hold them back. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=217.34s)]
*  If you want to learn, you will learn. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=220.9s)]
*  If you don't want to learn it, you don't learn it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  I will not say that I won't learn Polish, but I know that it's important for me and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  I need to learn it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SR__rTCEOE&t=231.1s)]
