# 'Reckless and careless': Former Trump White House aide describes mishandling of documents
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8)
*  Back with us once again is Cassidy Hutchinson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=0.0s)]
*  Her new book is called Enough. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=2.2s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=3.6s)]
*  Thank you again for being here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=5.12s)]
*  You write in the book in detail about your interactions [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=6.76s)]
*  with the January 6 committee. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=11.08s)]
*  You did six interviews with them plus the live testimony. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=12.24s)]
*  But then you also say that you met, I believe, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=15.72s)]
*  three times with Justice Department personnel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=17.84s)]
*  and prosecutors and once with the Fulton County grand jury. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=20.2s)]
*  Is that all correct? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=23.12s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=23.92s)]
*  Do you expect to be called to testify [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=25.48s)]
*  in any of the Trump trials? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  I have fully complied with all government investigations [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=30.24s)]
*  in all entities thus far and I will continue to do so. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=33.44s)]
*  You can't talk about whether you're gonna testify. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  If or when I am asked to testify, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=39.36s)]
*  I will comply as fully as I have in the past. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=41.92s)]
*  Did prosecutors involved in any of those conversations [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=44.72s)]
*  or any of the live cases ask you to leave certain topics [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  out of the book? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=52.68s)]
*  No. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=54.8s)]
*  Everything that is in the book is also consistent [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=55.64s)]
*  with my transcripts that are on the record [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=59.8s)]
*  with the January 6 committee. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=61.64s)]
*  Well, everything pertaining to the election fraud. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=64.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=67.2s)]
*  And Mr. Trump's attempt to overthrow the government [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=68.36s)]
*  to stay in power, all in the public record. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=71.48s)]
*  One of the things that you describe in some detail [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=75.32s)]
*  in the book that I don't just quite know what to make of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=77.92s)]
*  is involves your direct boss, Mark Meadows. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=80.64s)]
*  I've been describing you with the shorthand [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=84.88s)]
*  and you use this in the book. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=86.48s)]
*  You say sort of chief of staff to the chief of staff. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=87.44s)]
*  You're essentially the top staffer to Mr. Meadows. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=89.36s)]
*  So you're with him a lot of the time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=91.76s)]
*  You definitely know what's going on in his life. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=93.08s)]
*  You're close to him in the work sense [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=95.48s)]
*  every day that he's in the office. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=99.44s)]
*  And yet there is some mystery that I don't totally understand [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=101.8s)]
*  as to what he was burning in his fireplace [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=105.68s)]
*  and to what he was doing with either classified [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=109.08s)]
*  or previously classified documents related [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=112.56s)]
*  to Crossfire Hurricane, related to the Russia investigation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=115.0s)]
*  Are you describing what appeared to you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=119.56s)]
*  to be either mishandling of classified information [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=122.92s)]
*  or mishandling of presidential records, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=126.84s)]
*  destruction of presidential records, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=128.88s)]
*  which of course is not allowed? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=130.28s)]
*  The final days obviously was chaotic in a number of ways. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=133.68s)]
*  I was under the impression, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=139.36s)]
*  and I know there were several of my colleagues [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=141.04s)]
*  that were under the impression, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=142.84s)]
*  that how classified documents were being handled [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=143.76s)]
*  was not within proper protocol. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=146.6s)]
*  Now with saying that, I think it speaks also just [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=151.32s)]
*  to how reckless and careless much of the administration was. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=156.88s)]
*  Not taking classified document protocol seriously. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  A lot of the time, we've seen that with Mr. Trump as well. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=164.68s)]
*  But specific to my experience with Mr. Meadows [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  in the final days of the administration, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=172.44s)]
*  I talk about it a lot in the book, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=175.27999999999997s)]
*  to shed light on how chaotic things were. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=176.88s)]
*  But I can't really speak to what he was doing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  I would leave that as a question to him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it does sound like there were confrontations [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=186.27999999999997s)]
*  in the White House, including those that involved you, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  related to perceived mishandling of sensitive information. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  I dropped the bag on Pat Cipollone's floor. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=197.08s)]
*  Here are your classified documents [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  back from the reporters, Mark. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=201.24s)]
*  I didn't hide my contempt, my words rife with sarcasm. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  Mark and Mr. Cipollone peered into the bag. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=206.68s)]
*  I saw Mark swallow hard. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=209.16s)]
*  Pat shot me a piercing look. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=210.84s)]
*  Overwhelmed, Pat agonized. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=212.72s)]
*  Seriously, seriously, we do not have time for this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=214.36s)]
*  I was already walking out of his office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  You then describe Mr. Meadows at 11.45 a.m. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=220.28s)]
*  on inauguration day, asking the Secret Service [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=223.52s)]
*  how quickly they can get to the Justice Department [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=225.96s)]
*  because he wants to try to declassify something, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=228.68s)]
*  literally in the last 15 minutes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=231.24s)]
*  when Donald Trump is president. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=233.16s)]
*  Joe Biden's about to get sworn in, so yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=235.08s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=237.32s)]
*  What was he trying to do? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=238.96s)]
*  That specific binder was pertinent to crossfire hurricane, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  which, for the record, at the time, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  I had no idea what crossfire hurricane was. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=246.56s)]
*  But looking at the bigger picture here, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=250.12s)]
*  bringing it back to next year's election, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=253.44s)]
*  these people very well could be in power again. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=256.64s)]
*  And do we want people who have already shown [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=259.52s)]
*  that they're willing and want to overthrow an election, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=262.96s)]
*  a duly elected, for a duly elected president, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=267.44s)]
*  which is the pinnacle of our democracy, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=271.32s)]
*  do we want to put people like that back in power? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=273.64s)]
*  Do we want to put people back in power [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=276.12s)]
*  that have mishandled and have been showed to mishandle [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=278.16s)]
*  the most sensitive national security secrets [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=283.0s)]
*  that our nation has? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=285.2s)]
*  That's the question that we need to ask ourselves. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=287.44s)]
*  We got a statement from a spokesperson [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=289.92s)]
*  for Mr. Meadows tonight, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=292.2s)]
*  not sort of just vaguely casting aspersions at you, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=295.92s)]
*  so most of the statement, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=298.6s)]
*  but then saying, much of her claims in this book [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=300.0s)]
*  about Mr. Meadows or otherwise are filled with half truths, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  falsehoods, and purposefully omitting context to sell books. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Meadows is essentially just casting aspersions [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=312.28s)]
*  on your character, saying that you are making things up [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=314.96s)]
*  out of whole cloth in order to make money. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  You worked so closely with him for a long time, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=320.88s)]
*  but you also describe in the book [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=324.64s)]
*  that you never really trusted him, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=325.84s)]
*  and there are several instances you describe [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=327.0s)]
*  in which he flat out lied to you, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=328.52s)]
*  even on that close working matters [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=330.24s)]
*  where you should have been on the same side. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=332.28s)]
*  I should just ask for a response to you for that statement [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  and ask you what you think happened [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  between you and Mark Meadows. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=340.12s)]
*  I don't think there was anything [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=342.84s)]
*  necessarily negative to happen between me and Mark Meadows. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=346.08s)]
*  I was very outspoken after January 6th [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=349.84s)]
*  about how I felt about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=352.52s)]
*  Mark and I also knew that we were two different people, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=354.08s)]
*  and that's okay. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=357.0s)]
*  You know, we regularly talked about it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=357.84s)]
*  We would regularly joke about it, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  that I was more moderate than he was, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  but we did in large part work well together. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=363.0s)]
*  More ideologically moderate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=365.32s)]
*  Yes, yes, ideologically moderate, more so than he was, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  but putting that aside, in an environment like that, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=369.72s)]
*  that doesn't matter as much. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=374.12s)]
*  In terms of his statement, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  I would encourage him to go testify under oath [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  if he thinks that what is in the book [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  and what I have testified to under oath, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=383.04s)]
*  which is consistent with what is in the book, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  he can go testify under oath [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  if he has strong feelings about that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=390.36s)]
*  Were you disappointed that the Justice Department elected [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=392.48s)]
*  not to prosecute him for contempt of Congress [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  when he ignored the congressional subpoena [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  that you responded to from the January 6th investigation? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=400.03999999999996s)]

*  What I define as the right thing, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=413.56s)]

*  that you swore to protect your country, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=418.64s)]
*  not your president. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVhGMaczTk8&t=421.03999999999996s)]
