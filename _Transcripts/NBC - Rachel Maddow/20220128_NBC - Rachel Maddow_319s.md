# Putin Finds Small Victories In Ukraine Stand-Off
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo)
*  Joining us now live from Moscow is Anne Simmons, Moscow bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=0.0s)]
*  And thank you so much for staying up late and joining us on all of the facets of this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=5.36s)]
*  breaking story. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=9.92s)]
*  There was one development I didn't mention there, but a significant one. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=11.8s)]
*  President Biden telling reporters earlier today that he will be moving US troops to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=15.56s)]
*  Eastern Europe and the NATO countries in the near term. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=20.84s)]
*  I know it's still in the middle of the night there, perhaps early morning in Russia, but [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  do you think this will in any way change any of the dynamics or the calculation that we are seeing right now? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=28.16s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Eamon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=37.24s)]
*  First of all, I would say that it could, in fact, provoke Mr. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=38.92s)]
*  Putin in some way. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=42.92s)]
*  The Russians have been very clear that they don't like to be bullied. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=45.92s)]
*  Mr. Putin has made clear that Russian troops are on Russian territory and he doesn't believe [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=49.84s)]
*  that they do need to pull back. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=57.2s)]
*  In many regards, Mr. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=59.32s)]
*  Putin has won a small victory already because the world is now paying attention. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=60.88s)]
*  Everyone wants to speak to Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=66.36s)]
*  There's shuttle diplomacy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=69.16s)]
*  Everyone wants to speak to Russia and find out what Mr. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=71.56s)]
*  Putin intends to do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  So it's very difficult at this particular juncture to really pin down what the Russians next [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  move will be. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=83.72s)]
*  I'm curious whether you see it as well. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=86.48s)]
*  Has Putin made it costly for NATO to essentially accept not just Ukraine, but any future country [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=90.28s)]
*  in Eastern Europe where Russians can be stationed on its border? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Has he essentially made the cost of the future calculation of NATO saying it's not worth [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=100.4s)]
*  this headache to constantly have to worry about which country Russia is going to have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=105.72s)]
*  troops on its border that could suck us all into a major confrontation? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=109.36s)]
*  That could very well be the case. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  There's a certain level of instability now, insecurity, uncertainty, and it's something [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  that Mr. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=124.28s)]
*  Putin has wanted to create for Ukraine because there's no way that NATO is going to accept [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=125.28s)]
*  a country that has any kind of conflict on its territory. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=131.6s)]
*  So already there is this sense that Mr. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=136.24s)]
*  Putin has won a small victory there, that there is insecurity in Ukraine just by the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  very presence of 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border, 100,000 Russian troops. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=145.48s)]
*  Now, there's still no clear indication of whether or not those troops will all move [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=152.92s)]
*  in at once to overcome Ukraine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=159.16s)]
*  The Russians have said they do not intend to invade. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=162.32s)]
*  There could be small incursions into the country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=166.16s)]
*  There could be cyber attacks, which already we've seen some indication of. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=169.2s)]
*  There's a possibility that the Russians could arm the separatists in the Donbass region. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  So it's still a very tenuous situation. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  But in many ways, this is exactly what Mr. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=182.44s)]
*  Putin wants and how he likes it to kind of keep the West guessing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, you're in Moscow and I'm curious to get your thoughts about what Russians think. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=191.72s)]
*  How do Russian citizens feel about a potential invasion of Ukraine? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=195.56s)]
*  Would such an attack be received well? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=199.68s)]
*  Are they aware? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=202.28s)]
*  Do you think that they have a sense of what the international community might do in response? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=203.28s)]
*  And do you get a sense that they think, hey, you know what, Ukraine is just simply not [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=208.4s)]
*  worth what would happen to us if Vladimir Putin goes ahead with this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=212.68s)]
*  Well, there are several schools of thought here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=219.32s)]
*  You certainly do read about this talk of invasion in the newspapers and listen to it, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=221.84s)]
*  hear about it on talk shows. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Many Russians have Ukrainian relatives, and the last thing they want is a war in Ukraine [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=231.12s)]
*  or with Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=237.24s)]
*  Also, eastern Ukraine, the territory that would be probably where a first incursion [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=238.96s)]
*  would occur because that is where there are separatists who are very much in favor of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=247.36s)]
*  having some kind of closer connection to Russia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  That particular region is not Crimea. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=256.16s)]
*  In 2014, as we know, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine, and Russians were in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=258.92s)]
*  general extremely happy and pleased about that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=266.12s)]
*  They thought that, you know, they think that that is traditionally a part of Russia. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=268.72s)]
*  For eastern Ukraine, there is not a lot of talk about, you know, supporting an invasion [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  into eastern Ukraine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  Many Russians will tell you all of this provocation, all of this talk, its politics, and a lot [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  of them blame the West for kind of beating the drum of war. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKDFy-uqvyo&t=293.79999999999995s)]
