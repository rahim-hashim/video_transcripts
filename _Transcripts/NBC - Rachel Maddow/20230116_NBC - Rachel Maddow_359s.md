# GOP, embracing extremists and facing investigations, attacks law and ethics enforcement
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI)
*  We're following breaking news tonight out of New Mexico, where police have just announced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=0.0s)]
*  this evening that they've made an arrest in conjunction with their investigation of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=4.04s)]
*  shootings into the homes and offices of a half-dozen Democratic Party elected officials [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=7.72s)]
*  in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=13.36s)]
*  The man arrested tonight was the Republican nominee for a state legislative seat from [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=16.28s)]
*  Albuquerque in the November elections. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  He lost that race for the state legislature, but has since insisted publicly that he didn't [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=24.42s)]
*  lose, and the election was rigged against him. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=29.2s)]
*  Albuquerque police saying tonight that he is, quote, accused of conspiring with and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=31.96s)]
*  paying for other men to shoot at the homes of at least four Democratic elected officials. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=36.2s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=43.64s)]
*  He's a former member of the January 6th investigation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  He's now the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee in the House. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=47.56s)]
*  Congressman Raskin, it's great to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=50.76s)]
*  Thanks very much for being with us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=52.56s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=55.84s)]
*  It's great to be with you, too. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=56.84s)]
*  I know that you're learning about this New Mexico arrest just as we are tonight. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  This is breaking news that we've been covering. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  I have to ask if these allegations are proven out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=66.68s)]
*  This again is a Republican candidate for office who's an election denier, who's an outspoken [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=71.72s)]
*  Trump supporter. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=76.56s)]
*  He said on social media, Trump just announced for 2024, I stand with him. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=77.98s)]
*  I never conceded my race. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=83.4s)]
*  Now I'm researching my options. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=85.16s)]
*  If these allegations are borne out, is this the kind of radicalization, violent radicalization [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=87.74s)]
*  that you and your colleagues in the January 6th investigation were so worried about? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  Yes, we warned of this dangerous extremism that now has been embraced as part of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  political system. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump used dangerous extremists for his own purposes on January 6th, but they've [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=106.22s)]
*  used him as well and have been brought into the political system. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=111.94s)]
*  And now we're ending up with people like George Santos or Lauren Boebert or Salomon [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  Peña in New Mexico as actual Republican nominees for Congress. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=121.33999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's an extraordinary thing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  So if you have a policy of no enemies on the right, you are going to get people entering [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  into public office and entering into political campaigns who behave in such ways. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=134.62s)]
*  When you say no enemies on the right, do you mean that's the internal dynamic within [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=140.72s)]
*  Republican circles as pertains to extremism? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=145.8s)]
*  Well, that was Donald Trump's attitude. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=148.76s)]
*  Essentially, if you were willing to support Trump, it didn't make any difference if [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=152.68s)]
*  you were a Holocaust revisionist, if you were marching in Charlottesville, if you were a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=156.9s)]
*  liar, a cheat, a swindler, what have you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=163.24s)]
*  And when Kevin McCarthy decided to embrace Trumpism, he, by definition, embraced that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  credo too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=174.10000000000002s)]
*  And the chickens are coming home to roost with people like George Santos and Lauren [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=175.78s)]
*  Boebert and this guy in New Mexico. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=181.18s)]
*  I mean, a political party has got to be big and a big tent, but it really can't stand [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=184.58s)]
*  for dangerous extremists and criminals and other elements like that that will use electoral [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  politics for their own purposes, whether they're financial or ideological or, you know, political [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=196.14s)]
*  in an extremist sense. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=203.46s)]
*  And we're having this conversation in the context of yet another seditious conspiracy [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  trial being underway in Washington. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=212.1s)]
*  We had seditious conspiracy convictions related to the January 6th attack on Congress already [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=214.82s)]
*  for members of the Oath Keepers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=219.74s)]
*  The Proud Boys Seditious Conspiracy Trial is underway and will resume tomorrow after [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=221.68s)]
*  today's federal holiday. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=225.72s)]
*  I wonder if you think that the Republican takeover of the House and their efforts to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  target the FBI, to target the Justice Department, to describe what the DOJ and FBI have been [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=232.96s)]
*  doing as somehow weaponizing the federal government for political purposes, if you think that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  has the possibility of interfering with January 6th investigations and indeed these ongoing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=243.4s)]
*  prosecutions? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=248.96s)]
*  Well, that's one of the central purposes of it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=249.96s)]
*  You know, you have a lot of people who were involved at different levels in the January [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=255.16s)]
*  6th attempted political coup against the vice president, against Congress, and the insurrection [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=261.16s)]
*  which stormed the Capitol. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=267.36s)]
*  A lot of those people are involved, which is why we are calling the new committee the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=269.72s)]
*  Select Committee on Insurrection Protection, because a lot of these people are in it to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=274.52s)]
*  try to make sure they don't get investigated and they don't get prosecuted. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=279.62s)]
*  It is a larger principle. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=285.28s)]
*  It's not just about January 6th. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  It's in general about making sure that there is no neutral and objective law enforcement [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=288.56s)]
*  that comes to their door for any crimes they may have committed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=294.84s)]
*  And so it's a major threat to the rule of law in America. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, traditionally, the political parties have taken the position that the law enforcement [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=304.32s)]
*  function is independent and the politicians will not try to micromanage or interfere [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=309.6s)]
*  or obstruct what's taking place within law enforcement. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=315.72s)]
*  And the whole purpose of this committee is to obstruct the FBI or what Donald Trump today [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=319.36s)]
*  called the Fake Bureau of Investigation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=324.92s)]
*  It's an attack on law enforcement. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=327.44s)]
*  And lots of my Republican colleagues are calling for defunding the FBI, defunding the federal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  prosecutors and investigators. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-gEatt_JCI&t=336.56s)]
