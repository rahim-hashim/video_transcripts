# The GOP's problem of denying election results they don't like only getting worse
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE)
*  If you were looking for a succinct summation of the state of one of the two major American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=0.0s)]
*  political parties right now, you could do worse than the opening line of this Washington [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=4.64s)]
*  Post report from this weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=8.44s)]
*  Dateline Lansing, Michigan, quote, Republicans here, reeling from a midterm election route [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=10.52s)]
*  that many blamed on the influence of former President Donald Trump, responded Saturday [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=15.98s)]
*  by spurning Trump's choice for state party chair and choosing someone even more extreme. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=20.68s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=28.56s)]
*  After a chaotic party convention this weekend, yes, the Michigan Republican Party has elected [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=30.52s)]
*  as their new chair a woman whose relevant experience is having just lost a statewide [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=35.12s)]
*  election for secretary of state by a whopping 14 points. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=39.8s)]
*  She describes herself as a Christian nationalist. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  People who are Christian nationalists believe that only Christians should be citizens. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  She believes that demonic possession is not only real but contagious. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=52.94s)]
*  The core of her pitch to become chair of the Michigan State Republican Party was that she [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  believes the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump, but the 2020 election [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=61.96s)]
*  was also stolen from her as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=67.36s)]
*  Her opponent in the race for state party chairman, he also lost a race for statewide office in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=71.08s)]
*  Michigan last year, but his unforgivable sin after he lost that race was that he conceded [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=77.12s)]
*  that he lost. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=84.24s)]
*  She never conceded that she lost. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=85.92s)]
*  She still denies that she lost. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=88.44s)]
*  And so they picked her over him. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=90.84s)]
*  Because the more election denial, the better. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=93.14s)]
*  If there was any question as to whether or not there was any lessening of election denying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=96.92s)]
*  radicalism in the Republican Party, it would seem that actually the opposite is true, at [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=101.0s)]
*  least in Michigan. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=106.44s)]
*  But it's not like Michigan is an outlier here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=107.44s)]
*  Take for example, the state of Georgia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=109.12s)]
*  We've now learned that in Georgia, their state Republican Party is paying the legal bills [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=110.88s)]
*  of most of their fake electors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=116.16s)]
*  These are the people who are facing potential criminal prosecution now for having signed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=118.64s)]
*  forged documents that were then sent to Congress in the National Archives, forged documents [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=122.72s)]
*  claiming that Trump won their state, even though Trump didn't win their state. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  The state party is apparently behind them all the way for having done that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=133.04s)]
*  And we now know, thanks to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, that the state party has already paid out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=137.32s)]
*  over $200,000 for their legal bills. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=141.64s)]
*  Perhaps that's because one of the fake electors is the state party chairman of the Republican [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=145.92s)]
*  Party in Georgia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  There's one other of these that I think goes with it in Washington. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=153.48s)]
*  And it concerns Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=157.4s)]
*  Today Axios was first to report that Speaker McCarthy has decided to hand over all the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Capitol security camera footage from the January 6th attack. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=166.24s)]
*  This is 41,000 hours of footage. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=169.28s)]
*  He's handed it all over to the Fox News Channel, which has devoted hours and hours and hours [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=172.36s)]
*  of airtime to conspiracy theories about January 6th being a liberal deep state plot that only [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=178.12s)]
*  seemed like it was caused by Trump supporters, but really it was the liberals. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=183.88s)]
*  So the Speaker of the House just gave them all of the security camera footage from the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=189.38s)]
*  actual Capitol for them to play with, to see what they can do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=193.7s)]
*  Here you go, Fox News primetime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=198.61999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully you can use this official government material to concoct an alternate narrative [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=200.61999999999998s)]
*  to give us a more convenient revisionist history about what happened on January 6th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  These things all have one thing in common. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  As time goes by, the Republican Party's devotion to the stolen election lie, the Republican [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=215.22s)]
*  Party's devotion to denying the results of elections they don't like, the Republican [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=220.7s)]
*  Party's devotion to rewriting their history of their attempts to overturn previous elections. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=225.38s)]
*  That fever is not breaking. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=231.98s)]
*  This problem they've got is not diminishing over time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=234.33999999999997s)]
*  It is not getting better as time goes on. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=236.94s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehhj3ZunauE&t=239.57999999999998s)]
