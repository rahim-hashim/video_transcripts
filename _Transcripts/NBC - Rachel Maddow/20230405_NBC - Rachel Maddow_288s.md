# The charges against Donald Trump explained in brief
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw)
*  The contention from prosecutors today, which we did not know was coming in this exact way, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=0.0s)]
*  the contention from prosecutors today is that this overall scheme was a violation of New [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=5.28s)]
*  York election law, because New York election law makes it a crime to conspire to promote [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=10.88s)]
*  a candidacy by unlawful means. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  And what prosecutors said today is that part of the unlawful means alleged here is that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=18.64s)]
*  this company paid off all these people with weird sex stories about Donald Trump and then [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=23.68s)]
*  recorded it in their business records like they were buying Post-it notes or something. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=28.0s)]
*  They are saying that was a crime. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=31.76s)]
*  That's why this was an overall criminal scheme under New York law. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=33.84s)]
*  That's why these false business records that Trump oversaw and insisted upon can be charged [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=37.04s)]
*  as felonies. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=42.76s)]
*  That's why at least theoretically he should be facing jail time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=44.24s)]
*  But back to the scheme. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  First, we had the payoff to keep the doorman quiet. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Then we had the payoff to keep Karen McDougal quiet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=52.16s)]
*  Prosecutors said there was then one more person they paid to keep quiet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=54.6s)]
*  And that of course was Stormy Daniels, America's sweetheart. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  As prosecutors laid it out, by this point in the scheme, the National Enquirer Company [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=62.7s)]
*  was getting sick of throwing money down this filthy well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  So when it came time in the last few days before the election to pay off yet another [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=70.36s)]
*  person to keep quiet with a weird sex story about Donald Trump, the presidential candidate, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=74.76s)]
*  Mr. Trump himself and his own supposed business, they were left to take care of the money this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=79.8s)]
*  time on their own without that much help from the National Enquirer. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=84.04s)]
*  And that's where we got the Stormy Daniels payment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=88.72s)]
*  And that's where we got a deeply stupid Rube Goldberg scheme that was supposed to make [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  it seem like they were doing something other than paying Stormy Daniels to keep quiet before [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=97.62s)]
*  the election. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=102.26s)]
*  But anybody who looked at it for more than 10 seconds could tell that's what they were [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  doing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=107.28s)]
*  And that is where we got the enumerated receipts today for 34 different allegedly false business [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=109.32s)]
*  records, including the additional aggravating factor, which is the detailed summary of how [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=116.16s)]
*  they structured the Stormy Daniels reimbursement payments to Michael Cohen to look like something [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  other than reimbursement payments so they could deceive and therefore cheat the taxman [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  while also committing this other crime. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=131.72s)]
*  And the deceit of the taxman, the alleged tax purpose restructuring of these payments [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=134.32s)]
*  is again, as described by prosecutors, one of the attempted crimes that prosecutors need [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=140.84s)]
*  to be able to point to. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=145.64s)]
*  So all of this, all of this can be charged as a felony instead of just as a misdemeanor. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=147.01999999999998s)]
*  One last point here, here just to nut this up from the arraignment today, here's how [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=155.24s)]
*  the lead prosecutor laid it out to the judge basically to kick off the arraignment today [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=159.32s)]
*  after Trump pled not guilty. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=164.28s)]
*  He says this, the defendant, Donald J. Trump, falsified New York business records in order [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=166.84s)]
*  to conceal an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 presidential election [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=171.56s)]
*  and other violations of election laws. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=177.12s)]
*  Beginning in about August 2015, the defendant agreed with others to carry out an unlawful [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=180.44s)]
*  plan to identify and suppress negative information that could have undermined his candidacy for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=185.12s)]
*  president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=189.76s)]
*  As part of that plan, a lawyer employed by the Trump organization made a covert and illegal [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=190.76s)]
*  $130,000 payment at the defendant's direction. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=196.6s)]
*  The purpose of the payment was to avoid negative attention to the defendant's campaign by suppressing [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=200.08s)]
*  information about an allegedly sexual encounter between defendant and an adult film actress. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=204.52s)]
*  After the election, defendant reimbursed the lawyer through a series of disguised monthly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=210.8s)]
*  payments that hid the true nature of the payoff by causing a series of false business [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=215.08s)]
*  records in the records of the Trump organization here in Manhattan and even mischaracterized [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  for tax purposes the true nature of the payment. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=226.46s)]
*  Defendant falsified these New York business records with the intent to defraud, including [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=229.84s)]
*  the intent to commit another crime and to aid and conceal the commission of another [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=234.36s)]
*  crime. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=239.08s)]
*  This office, he said, has long prioritized protecting the integrity of business records [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=240.56s)]
*  maintained here in New York. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=245.0s)]
*  When those records are falsified in service of another crime, it's a felony. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=246.8s)]
*  That's what this defendant did when he falsified business records in order to conceal unlawful [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=251.68s)]
*  efforts to promote his candidacy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=256.72s)]
*  And that's why we are here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=260.28s)]
*  And that's from the transcript of the arraignment today. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X_dtbSgMKw&t=263.32s)]
