# Maddow on Trump allies amid indictment watch: 'A person cannot conspire alone'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI)
*  But among these seven states from which we had fake electors, it's a lot of fake electors, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, 16 of them already charged in Michigan, more of them being investigated as we speak, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  at least in Arizona and in Georgia, maybe in other places as well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=10.08s)]
*  It's a good reminder that in all these investigations that we are following around, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  particularly, the efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  it's not just former President Donald Trump who's in the crosshairs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=25.36s)]
*  For example, in special counsel Jack Smith's classified documents case, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=29.04s)]
*  charges have, of course, already been brought against Trump and also his staffer, Walt Nauda. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=32.64s)]
*  But we also have reporting that another Trump Organization employee has been told that they're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=39.12s)]
*  the target of that investigation and could face additional criminal charges. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=43.2s)]
*  Again, so yet another person could be charged in the classified documents case. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=47.76s)]
*  A person has been warned of charges, effectively given a target letter in that case. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=52.16s)]
*  And while we have yet to see any charges in the January 6th case, in the overturning the election [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=56.32s)]
*  part of the case, one of the statutes reportedly listed in the target letter that Trump has received [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=61.36s)]
*  on that is conspiracy. And if there's one thing we know about conspiracy charges, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=66.64s)]
*  it's that a person cannot conspire alone. Are there more names to drop? And what would that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=73.52s)]
*  mean for the likely progress of these cases? Joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg. He's a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=80.56s)]
*  former U.S. attorney and senior FBI official. If Trump is charged with conspiracy, and again, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=86.32s)]
*  we should say we have reporting about what's in his target letter. Even if we had definitive [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=91.6s)]
*  knowledge of what was in the target letter, there's no guarantee that what's in the target letter [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  is indicative that charges will be brought or that the charges that will be brought are those that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=101.28s)]
*  are related to the statutes mentioned in the target letter. I have to give you all the caveats. But [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=106.16s)]
*  it with all those caveats, if Trump is charged with conspiracy, there's no guarantee that his [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  conspirators, people he conspired with, would be charged under the same indictment or indeed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=118.32s)]
*  charged at all, right? That's exactly right. One can be an unindicted co-conspirator. In fact, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  if you think back to Michael Cohen's charges in the Southern District of New York, Cohen, of course, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=129.92s)]
*  Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, in that indictment, we learned about an unindicted [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  co-conspirator. Individual one is how the government described that person in the indictment, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  and that turned out to be Mr. Trump himself. You know, charging a case as a conspiracy confers on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=146.08s)]
*  the government certain evidentiary advantages. I'm not going to bore you with those now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=152.72s)]
*  So it makes sense often to charge a conspiracy, and often when you charge a conspiracy, you have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=157.36s)]
*  multiple defendants at trial. But to your point, Rachel, you're exactly right. You don't have to. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=163.76s)]
*  You can have unindicted co-conspirators that are flagged by the grand jury and mentioned in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=169.04s)]
*  indictment, but not sitting next to the defendant, perhaps Mr. Trump, at his own criminal trial. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=175.6s)]
*  Chuck, I have to ask you, I can't let you go without asking you one last question, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=182.72s)]
*  which is the question on everybody's mind in the news business this week, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=186.0s)]
*  which is what our expectations should reasonably be about the relationship between that reported [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  target letter and any indictment and any unsealing of an indictment against Trump if one is in fact coming. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=195.68s)]
*  Yeah, another great question. Well, when I was a federal prosecutor, I would occasionally [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=201.28s)]
*  send out target letters. I would never send out a target letter to somebody that I did not intend to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=206.96s)]
*  indict. They're not bluffs. They're not games. They're not make believe. So here's what you ought [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=214.16s)]
*  to expect. If Mr. Trump really did receive a target letter, then he will be charged with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  federal crimes. If he really received a target letter, that will happen relatively soon. Now, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=224.56s)]
*  to your points earlier, your caveats are wise. Target letters are not contracts, and the government [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  could change its mind. But in my experience, that would be unusual. What you should expect [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=236.72s)]
*  is a federal indictment of Mr. Trump and a federal indictment soon. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r_ic5oZwsI&t=241.6s)]
