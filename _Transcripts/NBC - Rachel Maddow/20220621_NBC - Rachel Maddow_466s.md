# Schiff: Trump Used His Big Lie As A Bludgeon To Bend Officials To His Will
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4)
*  Joining us now is California Congressman Adam Schiff of California. He is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=0.0s)]
*  He led today's hearing of the January 6th investigation sir. I know this has been a big day [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=5.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for making taking time to be with us here tonight [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=11.24s)]
*  Good to be with you [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=15.52s)]
*  it is my [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=17.12s)]
*  Estimation having very closely watched today's hearing that there were four main points [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=19.32s)]
*  That you brought forward the first and I think most prominent the most important of those is that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=24.16s)]
*  You explained how President Trump? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=30.12s)]
*  personally [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=33.32s)]
*  Took part in cajoling and trying to persuade people to overturn election results in the states [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=34.32s)]
*  He then personally took part in escalating from that to new tactics that would bring threats of violence and intimidation [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=40.22s)]
*  Against those same targets and we saw that I think in stark detail today [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=49.04s)]
*  Is that the main point that you and your co-investigators wanted to convey today? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Yes, really just how premeditated it all was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=60.68s)]
*  How it started with a big lie that the president was told over and over and over again by his attorney general a deputy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=66.4s)]
*  By his US attorney in Georgia by others was a big lie [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=73.32s)]
*  But but that didn't matter he used that big lie as a bludgeon [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=78.2s)]
*  To try to get these state legislators and elections officials to bend to his will to overturn the election [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=83.2s)]
*  But he ran into resistance by courageous public servants who? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  Said no, I'm not gonna violate my oath. You may be the president. You may be the head of my party [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=94.44s)]
*  But there's something more important to me and that's my oath and and that's my faith [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=100.0s)]
*  And I'm glad the public got to see these heroic people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Violence and it's Donald Trump's proximity to it whether it's with Mike Pence [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=112.44s)]
*  or [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=117.4s)]
*  with the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=118.44s)]
*  Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers has been a constant theme and the committee has gone farther than anyone else ever has [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=119.6s)]
*  To putting him not just adjacent to the violence but cheering for the violence indifferent to the consequences of the violence [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=125.72s)]
*  Does this story deepen? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=132.16s)]
*  I mean, do you have evidence that puts Donald Trump in the command and control position over the violence? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=133.92s)]
*  Meeted out by the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers and the other insurrectionist groups [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=138.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't want to get ahead of our committee presentations [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  but you know, I think that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=147.4s)]
*  One of the hearings where we explore what the president was doing what he was saying and what he was thinking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  While the violence goes on goes to this very point [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=154.72s)]
*  It goes to the point of dereliction of duty goes to the point that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=158.44s)]
*  That he he incited this violence. He incited this hatred [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  He riled up this base and and then what did he do while it was happening? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=167.76s)]
*  He sat back and watched it watched it all play out [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  and you know to see [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=175.4s)]
*  Today the human consequences of that just a small part of it these [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Election workers in Atlanta who were just going about their job. Who had no idea they were about to be hit with a club [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=183.04s)]
*  This this false claim the likening of what they did to the people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=190.92s)]
*  Claim the likening of what they did to to drug deals [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=195.44s)]
*  I was just disgusting and you see how people's lives were turned up to upside down and ultimately [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=199.12s)]
*  How lives were lost on January 6th? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=204.6s)]
*  Hi congressman Ari here you have this evidence of all these different people [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=207.44s)]
*  Submitting false electors including potentially to the government [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=212.64s)]
*  Do you view this as something where some one or more people have broken the law through that act alone? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=215.8s)]
*  Well, I share the view of Judge Carter in California that this plot overturned the election which had many facets [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  likely violated multiple federal laws and and likely implicated the president of the United States [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  You know whether one specific aspect or another [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  Violate a particular statute. I will have to leave to the Department of Justice, but I certainly believe [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=241.84s)]
*  Justice but I certainly believe there's more than enough evidence for them to investigate [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=246.76s)]
*  Each of the crimes that Judge Carter set out and I think the more evidence that we presented just strengthens the case [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=252.28s)]
*  for a federal investigation [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=260.36s)]
*  Congressman I'm just gonna jump in real quick here with a follow on Ari's question [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=262.12s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you about the response from Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin today after this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=266.6s)]
*  So his connection to this part of the plot was aired today in in the hearing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=271.96s)]
*  Senator Johnson said today that he was aware that his office had received [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  The forged certificates these fake sleights of electors, but he says he doesn't know who delivered them [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=281.88s)]
*  That struck us all here on the panel as odd because if you got something from somebody you don't know who [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=289.44s)]
*  The first instinct wouldn't be that you volunteer to hand deliver it to the vice president on January 6th [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  But that's what he says he says he doesn't even know where he got them from he was just a courier [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=300.68s)]
*  Does that jive with what you and the committee understand about Senator Johnson's involvement? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know I can't go into you know what the committee's evidence or understanding is [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=313.2s)]
*  I watched that same clip with a lot of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=319.28s)]
*  Interest today as senator Johnson essentially said that he knew that something had arrived in the office [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  His chief of staff was being asked to deliver to or being asked to help convey it to the vice president [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  This is January 6th. We're talking about and the idea [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=336.6s)]
*  That he wouldn't know what it was or anything about it. I think begs a lot of questions [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=340.48s)]
*  Congressman this is joy read. I actually have a question about a senator as well [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=348.76s)]
*  As Rachel did but it's about kind of the dog that didn't hunt today as I was watching the hearings today [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=352.04s)]
*  I kept waiting to hear one name that I didn't and that is senator Lindsey Graham [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=357.28s)]
*  Who we do know from the reporting also put pressure on? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=361.84s)]
*  Brad Raffensperger and others in the state of Georgia [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=366.32s)]
*  To hand Donald Trump the votes, you know [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  The flip the votes that he needed in order to win that election [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=373.08s)]
*  Can you talk a little about your process about who was included who was not included and will we hear more about? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=375.96s)]
*  Senator Graham's involvement in this pressure campaign on particularly the state of Georgia [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=383.16s)]
*  Well, you know in terms of the process as you might imagine [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=390.6s)]
*  There's a volume of evidence a mountain of evidence to try to communicate through each of these hearings [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=394.16s)]
*  Which you know are only lasting between two and three hours [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=399.8s)]
*  And so we have to kind of ruthlessly say what's most important to convey to the public [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  And that means a lot hits the cutting room floor now ultimately [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  We intend to open up and release our files and let the public know [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  The much bigger volume of what we have obtained [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=419.48s)]
*  I can't tell you exactly when that's going to happen [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=422.24s)]
*  But we do intend to share a lot that we couldn't cover in these hearings [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=425.5s)]
*  But yes, some very difficult decisions are made with each of these hearings [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=430.56s)]
*  What is most important knowing that we can't convey at all or even even more than a small fraction [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=434.64s)]
*  You [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKQ3aSLh7K4&t=464.64s)]
