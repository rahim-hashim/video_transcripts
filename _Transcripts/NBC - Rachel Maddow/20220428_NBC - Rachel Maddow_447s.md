# Why A 'Big Lie' Is So Powerful And So Hard To Undo
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg)
*  In 2010, Yale historian Tim Snyder published a new history, kind of a shocking new history [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=0.0s)]
*  of World War II. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=7.88s)]
*  Professor Snyder specializes in the history of Central and Eastern Europe, and the book [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=9.44s)]
*  was called Bloodlands, Europe between Hitler and Stalin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=12.56s)]
*  That book took on, really for the first time, what happened in total on the land east of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=16.88s)]
*  Berlin and west of Moscow between 1933 and 1945. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=25.44s)]
*  He elected to do something that nobody had ever really tried to do about that geography [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=29.88s)]
*  in the world in that time. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=35.14s)]
*  He told a single history, a single story of the 14 million people who were killed in that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=36.4s)]
*  part of the world while both Hitler and Stalin held power. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=42.84s)]
*  14 million people who were not soldiers, civilian non-combatants, not people who were caught [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=46.36s)]
*  in the crossfire while countries were trying to kill each other's soldiers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=53.04s)]
*  These were victims of mass killings sanctioned by policy in western Russia, in Belarus, in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=57.6s)]
*  Poland, in Ukraine, in the Baltic states, all in the same place, all from two different [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=65.0s)]
*  dictators over a 12-year time span. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=69.04s)]
*  Again, not war casualties in the sense of combatants, but war casualties in the sense [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=71.52s)]
*  of mass killing being a policy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  Professor Snyder's book is recognized and was soon recognized as a gigantic achievement [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=80.0s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=85.42s)]
*  It's of course all the more relevant because of the war in Ukraine now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=87.0s)]
*  This week, Professor Snyder published an updated paperback version of Bloodlands. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=91.44s)]
*  This one has a new afterword which offers a contemporary look at the work. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=95.72s)]
*  In it, among many other things, Professor Snyder reflects on his contribution to popularizing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=100.2s)]
*  the use of the term the big lie in reference to former President Trump's effort to basically [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=105.0s)]
*  overthrow the U.S. government last year, persuading his followers to believe the big lie that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=110.12s)]
*  the 2020 election was somehow stolen, even though there was never, ever any evidence [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=115.16s)]
*  to support that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=119.96s)]
*  Snyder says in his new afterword, quote, the big lie, a term that originates with Hitler, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=121.88s)]
*  became central to American political discourse after I applied it to Trump's claim to have [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  won an election that he had lost. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=130.24s)]
*  The concept of the big lie, which I reintroduced into discussion in 2019 and 2020, helped millions [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=132.3s)]
*  of people see how mendacity of a certain scale affects politics over time, making democracy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=137.66s)]
*  ever more difficult. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=145.74s)]
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=146.74s)]
*  He is professor of history at Yale University. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=148.7s)]
*  He's the author of Bloodlands, Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=150.42s)]
*  Again, it is out in a new edition this week. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=153.82s)]
*  Professor Snyder, it's really nice to have you here in person. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=155.82s)]
*  I don't do this anymore. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=157.7s)]
*  It's nice to see you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=158.7s)]
*  It's a thrill to see you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=159.7s)]
*  Let me ask you about that last quote that I just read. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=161.54s)]
*  Mendacity of a certain scale, how mendacity of a certain scale affects politics over time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=166.98s)]
*  Can you just tell us what you mean? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=172.82s)]
*  Well, the public relations advice is from Hitler. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=174.5s)]
*  Hitler says if you tell a lie that's of a certain scale, that's big enough, people won't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  believe that you could deceive them on that scale. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=183.42s)]
*  And since they believe it, they take it in at first, they don't want to disbelieve it [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=186.82s)]
*  later on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  It becomes part of their life. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  It becomes what we now call an alternative reality. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  It begins to shape politics. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=194.42s)]
*  It then begins to instantiate itself not only in memory, but in policy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=196.18s)]
*  You act as if it's true and then you move on to do things as though it were true. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=200.34s)]
*  So in our example, if we pretend that Trump won the election in 2020, then we have an [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=205.06s)]
*  argument for suppressing votes because we can say, well, there was fraud, therefore [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=210.14s)]
*  we should suppress votes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=214.94s)]
*  It's because of the sort of commitment part of that, it makes it feel undoable because [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=217.42s)]
*  if an X number of people become invested in it because they have once believed it, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=223.66s)]
*  and it would challenge their understanding of who they are and their worth in the world [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=232.18s)]
*  to lose that belief in it, it makes me worry about the ability to sort of unwire people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=235.98s)]
*  to learn the truth. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=242.72s)]
*  This is why lying is so dangerous in politics. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=244.54s)]
*  We've gotten very casual about lying. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=246.38s)]
*  We've gotten very casual about the people who bring us the truth, who are the reporters. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=248.42s)]
*  We've gotten very casual about the historians who are passing memory laws in this country, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=252.34s)]
*  just as Russia has passed memory laws. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  Those are laws designed in both cases to allow us to avoid the difficult little truths that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=258.46s)]
*  might prevent us from investing in the big lies. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  The problem with the citizens in the big lies, people in general in the big lies, is that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=266.5s)]
*  once you do something, for example, storm a capital, once you do something, that makes [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=269.98s)]
*  it more true. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=275.22s)]
*  So the politicians tell the big lie, but once we're brought in, once we do something, or [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=277.02s)]
*  in this book, for example, once you kill on the basis of a big lie, then the big lie [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=282.22s)]
*  really has to be true. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=286.70000000000005s)]
*  One of the things that I have sort of taken with me from Bloodlands is the idea that people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=289.36s)]
*  need to be erased and countries need to be erased and certain identities need to be erased [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  for the purposes of other countries, other leaders, other imperatives. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, talking, for example, about the mass murder of the Polish elite so that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=304.1s)]
*  the Polish people would somehow, could somehow be erased from history, that the idea of Poland [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  as a place could somehow be subverted into some other thing that was more politically [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=313.62s)]
*  useful for the attackers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=316.96s)]
*  That kind of eliminationist planning, not just genocidal, but literally to erase the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=319.82s)]
*  idea of a people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=324.34s)]
*  We are seeing that so overtly in the way that Putin is talking about Ukraine right now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  I am very worried that we are starting to talk in eliminationist terms about some of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=331.78s)]
*  our fellow Americans, the way that we are using not just epithets but also sort of classifications [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=336.1s)]
*  of people as not just our political opponents but as inhuman. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  The German invasion of Poland in 1939 has really been on my mind too because it is not [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=346.54s)]
*  just how Putin is describing Ukrainians. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  As you say, he says, the Ukrainians are a nation, they are not really a state, and that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  is genocide talk. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=356.66s)]
*  That is how you talk before you try to eliminate the nation and the state. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=357.66s)]
*  But it is not just talk. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=362.26000000000005s)]
*  This war of aggression is also a war of destruction. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=363.62s)]
*  They have deported about a million Ukrainians. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=366.22s)]
*  That is a considerable share of the population. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=367.98s)]
*  They are shooting the local elites. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=370.46s)]
*  They are killing the men they think are capable of taking part in military activity. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=371.86s)]
*  They are re-educating the teachers and the children. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=375.94s)]
*  They are going through with this idea as best they can of trying to eliminate the Ukrainian [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=378.98s)]
*  nation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=383.22s)]
*  And you are right, it all starts with talk. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=384.22s)]
*  And that is why we look on these examples of how Russians treat their history, how they [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=387.62s)]
*  treat their reporters, how they treat their language, and we have to learn these lessons [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=391.58s)]
*  in time. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  Because as you say, if we talk about our own reporters, our own fellow citizens in the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=397.5s)]
*  same way, then we are preparing ourselves to do terrible things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=401.02s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, you know him here on this show as the author of On Tyranny, which we [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=406.46s)]
*  have discussed many times here on this show. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=410.38s)]
*  The book that is seen as his sort of totem in the world of modern history is called Bloodlands, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=412.82s)]
*  and it is out in a new edition as of this week with a new afterword about the world [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=419.26s)]
*  today. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=422.7s)]
*  Dr. Snyder, it is an honor to have you here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=423.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=426.02s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eidNzvrukBg&t=427.02s)]
