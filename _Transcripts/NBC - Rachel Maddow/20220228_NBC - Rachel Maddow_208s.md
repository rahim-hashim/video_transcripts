# Lack Of Cryptocurrency Regulation Leaves Opportunity For Russians To Evade Sanctions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc)
*  Everybody should ratchet the pressure. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=0.0s)]
*  I was disappointed to see that some of the so-called crypto exchanges—not all of them, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=2.2s)]
*  but some of them—are refusing to end transactions with Russia, you know, from some, I don't [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=7.2s)]
*  know, philosophy of libertarianism or whatever. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=14.4s)]
*  Everybody—and if there has to be legal or regulatory pressure, everybody should do as [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=17.6s)]
*  much as possible to isolate Russian economic activity right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=22.92s)]
*  That pressure will absolutely impact Putin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=29.2s)]
*  The last time you were here, Madam Secretary, you raised that point. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=33.4s)]
*  You said, I hadn't asked you about it at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=36.04s)]
*  And you said you wanted to put a sort of spotlight on the need for regulation of the crypto market, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  specifically for national security purposes, so that they couldn't serve as an escape [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  hatch in the case of, you know, multilateral action to try to lock people out from specific [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=46.8s)]
*  currency for national security reasons. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=55.2s)]
*  In this case, crypto is looking like it could potentially be an escape hatch, as even the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=57.9s)]
*  Russian central bank is sanctioned and as we've seen these otherwise multilateral actions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=63.16s)]
*  I have to ask, after you've—since you've been raising those concerns, have you seen [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=66.9s)]
*  the Biden administration or even, indeed, other governments around the world start to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=70.86s)]
*  take that seriously in terms of how the crypto markets could be undermining in national security [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=76.06s)]
*  environments like this one? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=81.78s)]
*  Well, I think they're starting to take seriously the need to figure out the market and to provide [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=84.1s)]
*  guardrails, as you definitely should with any kind of large financial market like this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=89.14s)]
*  has become. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=96.54s)]
*  I think in the specific case of Ukraine, I do think that the Treasury Department, I think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=98.1s)]
*  the Europeans, should look hard at how they can prevent the crypto markets from giving [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=103.9s)]
*  an escape hatch to Russia, both governmental and private transactions in and out of Russia. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=110.2s)]
*  And I would hope they would do that because it—you know, it's so ironic, Rachel, because [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=116.48s)]
*  for people who live to make money, if they're making it legally, if they're not just a device [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=121.88s)]
*  or an excuse for money laundering, they should not want this invasion by Russia to stand. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=131.5s)]
*  They should figure out that, you know, we don't need to be descending into some kind of global [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=140.72s)]
*  conflict where dictators can decide that they're going to try to take over countries just because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  they wake up one morning. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=155.4s)]
*  No provocation at all. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  So it's really in the interests of everyone who wants to do legitimate business to try [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=159.46s)]
*  to end this conflict as quickly as possible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=164.3s)]
*  And one of the two pillars that we can rely on right now is the economic pillar. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=167.04s)]
*  So I would hope somebody at the Treasury Department is trying to figure out how they're going [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=171.84s)]
*  to rein in the leaky valves in the crypto market that might allow Russia to escape the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=177.22s)]
*  full weight of the sanctions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aaDHIwOIWc&t=184.70000000000002s)]
