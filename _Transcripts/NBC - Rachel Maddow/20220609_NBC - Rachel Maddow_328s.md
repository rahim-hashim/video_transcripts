# Schiff Sees 'Consciousness Of Guilt' In Lawmakers Who Sought Pardons For Jan. 6 Role
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4)
*  Congressman Adam Schiff is a member of the January 6th investigation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=0.0s)]
*  He, of course, is also chair of the House Intelligence Committee, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=3.44s)]
*  and he's standing by to talk with us now from the Capitol. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=6.08s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, Congressman Schiff, thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=8.52s)]
*  I know this is a busy and a big night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=11.24s)]
*  Well, it's good to be with you, and I thought it was a very powerful night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=14.32s)]
*  I think the chairman laid out the historical nature of what we went through that day, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=18.8s)]
*  the unprecedented attempt to interfere with the transfer of power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=25.24s)]
*  And then I think the vice chair importantly wove together the narrative [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=30.04s)]
*  about these multifaceted efforts to overturn the election, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=35.68s)]
*  the pressure on state legislatures and legislators, the pressure on the vice president, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=40.16s)]
*  the continued pushing of these false claims of fraud, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  even when the president's own attorney general said they were BS, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=51.6s)]
*  and how it led to that day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=56.36s)]
*  And then to hear Officer Edwards' testimony, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=59.04s)]
*  I can't imagine a more powerful reputation of the lie that this was a normal tourist day, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=62.32s)]
*  that this was legitimate political discourse. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=67.88s)]
*  And so we did, I hope, show the country just a bit of the amount of evidence that we have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=70.64s)]
*  and gave the country a sense of what lies ahead in our future hearings. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Schiff, there's a historical importance to this, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  which defies both politics and party affiliation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=90.48s)]
*  This is also happening in a partisan and political environment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  We, after all, are holding these hearings as part of a congressional investigation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=97.4s)]
*  That said, there was a provocative piece of evidence described tonight by Liz Cheney [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=101.84s)]
*  about unnamed Republican members of Congress. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=108.4s)]
*  She said during her opening statement, Republican Congressman Scott Perry [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=112.32s)]
*  was involved in trying to get Jeffrey Clark appointed as attorney general, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=116.92s)]
*  which was described as an effort to try to get the Justice Department to use lies [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=120.32s)]
*  to put the weight of the department behind the effort to steal the election result for President Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=124.56s)]
*  She said, Representative Perry has refused to testify here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=130.76s)]
*  As you will see, he contacted the White House in the weeks after January 6th [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=134.12s)]
*  to seek a presidential pardon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=137.64s)]
*  Multiple other Republican congressmen also sought presidential pardons [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=139.6s)]
*  for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=143.55999999999997s)]
*  We have seen some things pointing at this in the past. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  I've never seen it put that bluntly before. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=149.76s)]
*  Is the implication of this evidence that the committee has collected [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=152.32s)]
*  that members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  committed what they believe to be crimes in this plot [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  and thereby, therefore sought pardons from the president before he left office? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=164.2s)]
*  Well, look, I think the fact that members of Congress were interested in trying to get [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=170.32s)]
*  a preemptive pardon for their role in the effort to overturn the election [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=175.84s)]
*  tells you a lot about their consciousness of guilt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=180.44s)]
*  If they thought that what they were doing was above board, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  then of course there would be no need for a pardon. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=186.0s)]
*  And, you know, this is part of the reason we wanted these members to testify. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=189.04s)]
*  It's probably part of the reason why they refused to testify. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=192.88s)]
*  But nonetheless, it gives the public a sense of just the depth of information [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=196.6s)]
*  we've been able to accumulate, the scores of witnesses. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=202.6s)]
*  You saw some of that deposition testimony tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=208.16s)]
*  The real challenge for our committee, you know, frankly, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=211.56s)]
*  is how do we choose what is most important to share with the public? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=213.72s)]
*  And I think that what we will try to do is make available in these hearings [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=219.28s)]
*  as much as we can and then provide in online resources for others [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=226.8s)]
*  a wealth of other material for you and other members of the press [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  and public to scrutinize. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=236.36s)]
*  Congressman, is it clear to you and other members of the committee [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=239.12s)]
*  what the exact witness lineup will be for the seven hearings that have been described? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  We heard Vice Chair Liz Cheney today describe the rough topics [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=246.12s)]
*  and rough areas of evidence that will be covered in each of the next six hearings [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=251.8s)]
*  that will happen during the month of June. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=256.24s)]
*  Is it clear to you now, is it actually a settled matter [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  who the live witnesses will be or some of that still under negotiation? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=261.32s)]
*  You know, I think many of the witnesses, if not most of the witnesses, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=266.88s)]
*  are already settled upon or arrived at. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=270.48s)]
*  But, you know, there may be changes among the witnesses, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=274.12s)]
*  new witnesses or others that are replaced, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=277.56s)]
*  so I don't know that it's going to be static. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=280.12s)]
*  We're continuing to learn new information, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=282.84s)]
*  continuing to talk to new witnesses, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=285.24s)]
*  and going back to some of the witnesses we've interviewed [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=287.32s)]
*  now that we have more information. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=289.52s)]
*  So I don't want to say that it's fixed in place, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=291.28s)]
*  but we certainly, I think, have lined up most of the witnesses [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  in this set of hearings. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=298.12s)]
*  Now, this may not be the last of the hearings as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=299.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pETbaDs7I4&t=304.08s)]
