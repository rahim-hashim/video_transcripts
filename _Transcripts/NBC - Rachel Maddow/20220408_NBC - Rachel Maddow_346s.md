# In Ketanji Brown Jackson's Success, A Lesson In What Is Possible In A Democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU)
*  If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=0.0s)]
*  possible, who still wonders if the dream of our Founders is alive in our time, who still [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=9.76s)]
*  questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=19.16s)]
*  It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=25.48s)]
*  election, at this defining moment, change has come to America. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  On the night of November 4th, 2008, Barack Obama became the first black person elected [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  to the highest office in the land. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=54.04s)]
*  He reminded the country and the world of what democracy makes possible because of the people [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=56.0s)]
*  who got out the vote, who organized registration drives, stood in line for hours to cast their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=61.08s)]
*  ballots. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=66.6s)]
*  Because of them, change arrived. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=67.6s)]
*  The following year, President Obama nominated Katanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Sentencing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=70.56s)]
*  Commission. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=75.68s)]
*  Three years later, he nominated her to the federal bench. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=76.68s)]
*  And today, on the White House South Lawn, Judge Jackson reminded us of that history, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=80.32s)]
*  which along with many others, many other building blocks, helped lay the foundation for her [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=84.96s)]
*  Supreme Court confirmation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=89.72s)]
*  I am also ever buoyed by the leadership of generations past who helped to light the way, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=93.24s)]
*  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and my personal heroine, Judge Constance [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=100.52s)]
*  Baker Motley. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  They and so many others did the heavy lifting that made this day possible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=109.28s)]
*  And for all of the talk of this historic nomination and now confirmation, I think of them as the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  true path breakers. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=123.64s)]
*  I am just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  No one does this on their own. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=133.52s)]
*  The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  And in the poetic words of Dr. Maya Angelou, I do so now while bringing the gifts my ancestors [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=144.72s)]
*  gave. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  I am the dream and the hope of the slave. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=156.24s)]
*  Judge Jackson worked hard for this moment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=174.28s)]
*  She graduated from Harvard with honors twice. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=176.28s)]
*  Clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer worked as a public defender and served as a judge for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=179.44s)]
*  10 years, but she credited the path breakers who came before her because their contributions [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=183.0s)]
*  to this moment are a matter of fact. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=188.8s)]
*  Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to sit on the federal judiciary. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=191.8s)]
*  Motley worked on civil rights cases alongside Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=195.8s)]
*  Fund. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=200.84s)]
*  Motley was integral to the outcome of Brown v. Board of Education, striking down the separate [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=201.84s)]
*  but equal doctrine. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=206.88s)]
*  Judge Jackson's own parents attended segregated schools. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=208.76s)]
*  Martin Luther King, the face and voice of the civil rights movement that Motley helped [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  fight for in the courtroom. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=216.72s)]
*  Thurgood Marshall, the jurist who was confirmed despite the objections of southern segregationists [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=218.72s)]
*  in the Senate as the country's first black Supreme Court justice in 1967, three years [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=224.44s)]
*  after the Civil Rights Act passed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  All of that and more is the heavy lifting that Judge Jackson says made this day possible. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=233.12s)]
*  And all of those stories are intertwined in ways that make America a better democracy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  They made the highest achievements in this country a little more accessible to anyone [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=244.12s)]
*  who dares to reach for them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=248.16s)]
*  Because of what they did in their days, change came to America today. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=250.52s)]
*  These gains matter. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=257.4s)]
*  They build over time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=258.6s)]
*  They make this country able to live up to its ideals for the whole world to see, including [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=259.6s)]
*  our adversaries. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=264.56s)]
*  None of this history is far behind us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=266.36s)]
*  It was present today as Judge Jackson spoke in front of a house built by enslaved people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=268.56s)]
*  It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a black woman to be selected to serve [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=276.56s)]
*  on the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=286.84s)]
*  But we've made it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=294.56s)]
*  We've made it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=298.56s)]
*  All of us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=300.56s)]
*  All of us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=302.56s)]
*  And our children are telling me that they see now more than ever that here in America, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=310.56s)]
*  anything is possible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=320.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4TQwJ3MSeU&t=328.2s)]
