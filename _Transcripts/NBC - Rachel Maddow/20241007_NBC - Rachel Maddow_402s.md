# Trump adds to burden of disaster emergency response with lies, misinformation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8)
*  These intense, even emotional warnings about the possible impact of Hurricane Milton come, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=0.0s)]
*  of course, just a week and a half after Hurricane Helene banged into Florida's Big Bend region [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=8.4s)]
*  and then proceeded up an inland, where it caused just shockingly widespread and profound [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=13.76s)]
*  destruction in parts of Georgia and South Carolina and North Carolina and Virginia and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=21.56s)]
*  Tennessee. And recovery efforts in those states continue. But one of the other things that people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=27.0s)]
*  in these states are having to contend with, which is insane, is on top of everything else, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=33.64s)]
*  a tidal wave of disinformation and conspiracy theories designed to maximize the chaos and turn [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=39.8s)]
*  people against each other and reap whatever political points can be wrung out of it. I mean, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=49.84s)]
*  amid everything else, here is the front page of the Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=55.72s)]
*  their front page, all columns above the fold headline, fighting misinformation. It's the last [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=61.16s)]
*  thing you think they'd have to be dealing with, given everything else they're dealing with. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Hurricane Helene triggers misinformation surge. In Charlotte, North Carolina, here's the editorial [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=70.36s)]
*  board of the Charlotte Observer. Shame on Donald Trump for worsening North Carolina's Helene tragedy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=77.44s)]
*  with political lies. FEMA has had to make a whole section of its website devoted to debunking false [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  conspiracy theories and disinformation about the hurricane and the response that have been spread, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=92.0s)]
*  among other people, by the Republican candidate for president of the United States. The North [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  Carolina Department of Public Safety, again, with everything else they have to deal with, they have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=103.16s)]
*  also had to make a fact versus rumor new website to help people sort through the trash that is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=107.56s)]
*  being promoted for political benefit. Back in reality, among people actually involved in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=112.84s)]
*  response, North Carolina's governor has called the federal response to Helene, quote, unprecedented. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  North Carolina Republican Senator Tom Tillis says he's impressed with the federal response. He says [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=126.04s)]
*  he is proud of the response effort, that they're doing a great job. A Republican state senator in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=131.08s)]
*  North Carolina who represents Western North Carolina, he's posted a public plea, quote, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=136.4s)]
*  friends, can I ask a small favor? Will you all help stop this conspiracy theory junk that's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=140.76s)]
*  floating all over Facebook and the Internet about the floods in Western North Carolina? Example, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  FEMA is stealing money from donations, body bags ordered, but government has denied, bodies not [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  being buried. Government is controlling the weather from Antarctica. Government is trying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=155.56s)]
*  to get lithium from Western North Carolina, stacks of bodies left in hospitals, and on and on and on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=160.2s)]
*  He says, quote, please help stop this junk. It is just a distraction to people trying to do their [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=165.8s)]
*  job. Folks, this is a catastrophic event of which this country has never known. It is the largest [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  crisis event in the history of North Carolina. The state is working nonstop. DOT has deployed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  workers from all over the state. Duke Power has 10,000 workers on this. FEMA is here. The National [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=181.96s)]
*  Guard is here in large numbers. And he goes on. Even some of the most partisan actors, Florida [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=187.2s)]
*  governor, Florida Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, even he says his state has received all the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  federal help that it's asked for. But in the Trump campaign, the federal government is denying [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=200.56s)]
*  anybody any help. Right? And the Trump campaign and on Elon Musk's Twitter, they have decided it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=207.04s)]
*  better to mess with people, turn people against each other and lie about the response and see what [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=213.32s)]
*  they can stir up and see if Trump can benefit from it. I mean, here, for example, is the 9-11 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  truther, self-proclaimed white advocate, conspiracy theorist, who Trump brought with him to the 9-11 [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=226.0s)]
*  commemoration last month in Manhattan, quote, the people in Appalachia should not comply with FEMA. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=233.6s)]
*  This is a matter of survival. Do not comply with FEMA. This is what they're doing for political [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=239.4s)]
*  benefit. Right? Sure. Six different states coping with devastation from a hurricane less than two [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=246.12s)]
*  weeks ago and another storm on the way that is so large and terrifying, it is bringing meteorologists [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=252.28s)]
*  to tears. Trump campaign sees that and thinks what better time than to mess with people? What better [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=258.12s)]
*  time is there than this? Because maybe we'll benefit from it. Maybe if people are pushed into [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=265.48s)]
*  the most extreme circumstances possible, maybe we'll benefit from things being as bad as they can [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=270.44s)]
*  possibly be. The Harris campaign just tonight has released a new ad pushing back at the lies that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump and his campaign have been trafficking in about the hurricane response, also reminding the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=284.92s)]
*  country that this was not exactly his strong suit while he was in the White House in charge of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  efforts like this. Here it is again. This ad has just come out, just come out tonight. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=294.12s)]
*  Again, that is just released tonight from the Harris campaign in the wake of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=354.12s)]
*  even Republican officials in multiple states affected by Hurricane Colleen starting to beg [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=364.76s)]
*  Trump and his campaign to stop lying about the response, to stop spreading disinformation and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=369.96s)]
*  conspiracy theories among people who rather desperately need real and reliable information [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=374.68s)]
*  and real help. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=379.96s)]
*  you [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imzwtBbyIe8&t=384.12s)]
