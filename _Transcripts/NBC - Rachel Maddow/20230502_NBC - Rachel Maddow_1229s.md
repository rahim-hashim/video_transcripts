# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 1
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw)
*  This Nazi stuff, it's like it started off as one little itchy spot in Ohio, but now it's clear it's not a bug bite, it's a rash. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=0.0s)]
*  And it's oozing and spreading all over. It's disgusting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=7.0s)]
*  But it really doesn't help to pretend that you can't see it, Ohio. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=11.0s)]
*  And it's not like it's hard to follow the plot here about what these guys are doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=16.0s)]
*  In each of these instances, these Nazi groups are turning out in Ohio, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=20.0s)]
*  and the purported motive behind the attempted arson at the Ohio church. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=25.0s)]
*  It's all for the same reason, to harass and intimidate trans people and queer people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=29.0s)]
*  This thing this weekend with the guys in the red pajama suits and the swastika flag and the guy dressed up like heat miser, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=35.0s)]
*  that was outside a drag brunch that was being held at a local Columbus, Ohio business. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=42.0s)]
*  A drag brunch that would benefit a nonprofit called Kaleidoscope Youth Center. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=48.0s)]
*  The Nazis showed up outside that this weekend when it was the Wadsworth, Ohio Nazi show of force a few weeks ago, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=54.0s)]
*  that was also outside a drag performance. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=60.0s)]
*  Also the church arson just outside Cleveland that was targeting a church holding family friendly drag events. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=64.0s)]
*  See, it's all one idea because the Nazis in America are Nazis in America these days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=70.0s)]
*  They have their cause. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=75.0s)]
*  And they're doing this stuff in part for the same reason they're doing it in Florida all the time now [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=78.0s)]
*  and in other states. First it's to try to intimidate and freak people out, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=83.0s)]
*  but it's also to try to desensitize us to swastikas and Nazi imagery of all kinds and the presence of Nazis on our street corners and not our public protests. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=87.0s)]
*  It's so we expect it, I guess. So we're maybe not so shocked by it as much as we might otherwise be. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=97.0s)]
*  If you're not down with that, though, if you are not excited by the little Nazis blooming like stinkweed everywhere these days, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=104.0s)]
*  it might give you some pause, right, if you realize that the reason these Nazis keep turning out, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=111.0s)]
*  the reason these Nazis are out there in the streets and on the street corners and in these public parks, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=116.0s)]
*  the reason they keep doing this stuff is that they're cheering on what you've been doing in your day job. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=121.0s)]
*  That might give you pause, right, if you started to notice what all these Nazis were doing and realized that what they were doing was pulling for your side. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=128.0s)]
*  In Ohio, for example, it might give you pause if you were an Ohio Republican [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=138.0s)]
*  and you've been working on legislation to attack queer people and trans people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=144.0s)]
*  While at the same time repeatedly, you know, these guys are the crowds who are turning out to bolster that message [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=149.0s)]
*  to make sure that the harassment and intimidation of queer and trans people has not just the imprimatur of state law, but also a Nazi flair. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=155.0s)]
*  Right, you might think that would give you pause in Ohio to realize who is aligning themselves with your cause. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=163.0s)]
*  It is not giving Ohio Republicans pause, apparently. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=169.0s)]
*  Just in the last few days, they have been happy to hold new hearings on their proposed legislation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=174.0s)]
*  to make the street Nazis very happy by further targeting trans people in Ohio. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=179.0s)]
*  And then there's the blue states, the Democratic-led states that are trying to head this stuff off in their own way, in a different way. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=186.0s)]
*  They're at least trying to provide people some safety, some place to hide from these kinds of laws [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=194.0s)]
*  that Republicans and their uniformed ski masks cheerleaders are now pursuing everywhere they have power. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=199.0s)]
*  We saw it happen in Minnesota a few days ago. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=207.0s)]
*  The Democratic governor there, Tim Walz, signing legislation to provide legal protection to people from other states, families, and individuals from other states who need help. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=210.0s)]
*  People who have to leave the state where they live in order to get gender-affirming health care or to get an abortion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=220.0s)]
*  So if your home state now bans the kind of health care you need as a transgender person, or if your home state now bans abortion, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=228.0s)]
*  if your state is one of these Republican-led states that's now threatening to bring prosecutions against you or against your doctor for seeking this kind of care, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=236.0s)]
*  Minnesota law officially now says, we will provide you refuge. You can come here. You will be safe here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=244.0s)]
*  This was the headline and the lead in the Minnesota Star Tribune, quote, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, quote, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=252.0s)]
*  New laws make Minnesota a refuge for abortion and gender-affirming care. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=258.0s)]
*  People traveling to Minnesota for abortion or gender-affirming care will now be shielded from legal consequences under new laws signed by Democratic governor Tim Walz. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=263.0s)]
*  And Minnesota is among the latest, but they are certainly not alone. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=275.0s)]
*  The Democratic governor in Colorado and the Democratic governor of New Mexico each just recently signed similar shield laws to protect people who are fleeing Republican states, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=280.0s)]
*  to protect doctors who Republican states are threatening to come after, even in states where abortion is legal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=292.0s)]
*  And then there's Washington state in the Pacific Northwest. You might remember a few weeks ago, we covered a new law passed by Republicans in Idaho. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=299.0s)]
*  And in Idaho, the Republicans there are not only banning abortion in their state. That's not going far enough for them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=308.0s)]
*  No, Idaho Republicans have taken it a step further. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=315.0s)]
*  They've passed a law that would try to ban Idaho residents from leaving Idaho to get an abortion somewhere else. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=318.0s)]
*  This means Idaho Republicans are explicitly threatening to bring prosecutions against doctors in other states for providing abortions to Idaho residents while they're not in Idaho. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=328.0s)]
*  It's like your state's politics stain you personally and you're never allowed to wash it off. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=340.0s)]
*  The Idaho ban threatens their own state's residents, threatens Idaho residents for leaving the state. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=347.0s)]
*  It threatens anybody hoping an Idaho resident leave the state and it threatens doctors in other states where abortion is still legal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=354.0s)]
*  Just an incredible thing that Idaho Republicans are trying to do. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=362.0s)]
*  But I was struck at the time we first covered this a few weeks ago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=366.0s)]
*  I was struck by the personal put my name on it intervention from the Democratic governor of a state that borders Idaho. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=370.0s)]
*  Washington state's Democratic Governor Jay Inslee. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=380.0s)]
*  Idaho was considering that bill, which they have now passed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=383.0s)]
*  Governor Inslee wrote to his Republican counterpart wrote directly to the Republican governor in Idaho. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=386.0s)]
*  He wrote him a letter man to man governor to governor telling him, don't do it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=392.0s)]
*  Dear Governor Little, I write this letter to urge your veto of this Idaho ban on people leaving the state of Idaho to get an abortion. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=399.0s)]
*  And then Governor Inslee explained his objections to the bill. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=409.0s)]
*  He warned the Idaho governor that this legislation would contribute further to what he described as already an exodus of health care professionals from Idaho. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=412.0s)]
*  But then he said this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=424.0s)]
*  He said, quote, Regardless of your decision on this bill. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=427.0s)]
*  We welcome Idaho's patients and health care providers with open arms in Washington. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=432.0s)]
*  We will care for your residents in a manner consistent with their health care needs as as determined by trained medical professionals, not politicians. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=437.0s)]
*  But make no mistake, Governor Little, the laws of another state that seek to punish anyone in Washington for lawful actions taken in Washington will not stand. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=445.0s)]
*  He says, quote, We will protect our providers and we will harbor and comfort your residents. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=454.0s)]
*  Who seek health care services that are denied to them in Idaho. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=461.0s)]
*  We will harbor and comfort your residents who have to flee your state to come here to get health care that you have criminalized. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=464.0s)]
*  He signed his name to it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=472.0s)]
*  And Idaho has since signed that legislation. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=475.0s)]
*  But Washington has agency, too. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=479.0s)]
*  And since then, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has signed legislation that blocks law enforcement officials and courts in Washington state from aiding any other states' abortion. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=482.0s)]
*  Related legal investigation. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=493.0s)]
*  It blocks police and courts in Washington from assisting other states investigations going after trans people. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=495.0s)]
*  He signed legislation to protect Washington doctors from professional disciplinary action if they provide care that is in violation of some other states laws. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=502.0s)]
*  He signed legislation that says in Washington, the data from cell phone apps that that track your period. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=511.0s)]
*  That data can't be shared without you OKing it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=518.0s)]
*  So they cannot use that data. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=521.0s)]
*  They cannot use those apps as evidence in any prosecution related to abortion. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=523.0s)]
*  Governor Inslee has also bought a stockpile of abortion pills for Washington. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=529.0s)]
*  He signed legislation to assure that medication abortions stay legal and available in Washington, even as Republicans try to ban them in every state in the country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=533.0s)]
*  And, you know, there's always a tale of two cities that you can tell in this country. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=542.0s)]
*  I've always been interested in state policy, state politics, the way things shape up and the way you can see the states, not just as sort of laboratories of democracy, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=547.0s)]
*  but you can see the states where they are trying out things that each of the parties wants for the whole country. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=555.0s)]
*  And so there's always been a tale you can tell about what Republican controlled states are doing versus what they're doing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=560.0s)]
*  And I think I find it probably more interesting than most. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=568.0s)]
*  I've always been intrigued by these stories. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=571.0s)]
*  But, you know, as much as you can see in different states between red states and blue states, a difference in priorities, a difference in outcomes, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=573.0s)]
*  sometimes a notable difference in seriousness of purpose among lawmakers in those two different kinds of states for all of that, all those trends that I followed for years. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=580.0s)]
*  This is one of the few times I can remember when Democrats were in the room and they were talking about the fact that they were going to be able to do this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=590.0s)]
*  When Democratic states like Jay Inslee's Washington state are passing not just legislation that's different than what they're doing in the Republican state, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=597.0s)]
*  not just passing legislation that makes blue states distinct from Republican states in terms of policy and likely outcomes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=606.0s)]
*  This is the first time that I can remember when Democratic controlled states feel the need to pass rafts of legislation basically just to protect themselves from red states and what they're doing over there. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=613.0s)]
*  Last year, Republicans in Arizona lined up behind a bill that would have punished teachers and opened them up to lawsuits. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=628.0s)]
*  The idea was this. If a student was, for example, scared to tell his or her family that they were gay or transgender or thinking about those issues, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=635.0s)]
*  and the student decided instead to talk with their teacher about it, well, this Arizona law would create an affirmative legal obligation for the teacher, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=645.0s)]
*  forcing the teacher to call the student's parent and tell. And if the teacher didn't do it, Arizona Republicans said that teacher should lose his or her license, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=654.0s)]
*  and it should be OK for the teacher to be sued as an individual. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=662.0s)]
*  During that same session, Republicans also pushed legislation that would have banned books like Maya Angelou's book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=666.0s)]
*  or George Orwell's 1984, or F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. They'd all be banned. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=675.0s)]
*  Critics say that because of the way that bill was originally crafted, it would have also made it illegal to teach anything at all about homosexuality. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=682.0s)]
*  You could not say that it exists. What those two bills had in common is that to create those bills, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=692.0s)]
*  Republicans in Arizona consulted with the same far-right interest group, a group called Family Watch International. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=700.0s)]
*  It's based in Arizona, but while that group is based in Arizona, they really only dabble in this stuff in the United States, where they really do most of their work is overseas. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=707.0s)]
*  This is a right-wing anti-gay group in America, in Arizona, that for years has backed anti-gay legislation in countries like Nigeria, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=716.0s)]
*  where same-sex relationships are punishable by death, depending on what part of the country you're in. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=726.0s)]
*  Along the way, this Arizona group has also forged close ties with the virulently anti-gay activists who were enthusiastic supporters in parliament of Uganda's previous kill the gays bill. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=732.0s)]
*  In March of this year, just weeks ago, this Arizona group was one of the key organizers of a conference in Uganda that hosted lawmakers, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=745.0s)]
*  hosted elected officials from more than a dozen countries in Africa. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=755.0s)]
*  At this conference, again, organized by an Arizona conservative group, lawmakers from more than a dozen countries gathered in Uganda and promised that in their home countries, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=759.0s)]
*  they would push legislation against the sin of homosexuality. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=769.0s)]
*  Here's the head of Family Watch International meeting with her longtime friend, the First Lady of Uganda, at that conference. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=774.0s)]
*  The First Lady said that during that most recent meeting, they discussed, in her words, concern about the imposition of harmful practices like homosexuality. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=781.0s)]
*  American activists taking that message abroad. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=790.0s)]
*  Well, now Family Watch International's efforts appear to be paying off. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=794.0s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, the parliament in Uganda passed what amounts to a new kill the gays bill that would impose the death penalty for certain offenses. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=799.0s)]
*  It calls for life in prison for anybody who has gay sex. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=809.0s)]
*  It makes it illegal to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ people. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=813.0s)]
*  Advocacy would carry up to 20 years in prison as its penalty. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=818.0s)]
*  The White House has already come out hard against this legislation. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=822.0s)]
*  Before I turn it over to my NSC colleague here, I want to say one thing at the top. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=828.0s)]
*  We have grave concerns with the passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Act, AHA, by the parliament of Uganda yesterday, and increasing violence targeting LGBTQI plus persons. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=834.0s)]
*  The bill is one of the most extreme anti-LGBTQI plus laws in the world. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=845.0s)]
*  Human rights are universal. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=852.0s)]
*  No one should be attacked, imprisoned, or killed simply because of who they are or whom they love. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=854.0s)]
*  Strong criticism from the White House by the Biden administration for this proposed new kill the gays law in Uganda. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=863.0s)]
*  The status of it right now is that it's been sent back to the parliament in Uganda for, quote, strengthening. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=868.0s)]
*  Apparently, the president of Uganda wanted a provision added regarding so-called conversion therapy to cure people of being gay. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=875.0s)]
*  But as far as we know, this thing could be reintroduced as soon as tomorrow. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=885.0s)]
*  Our next guest who's joining us live from Uganda is one of the most accomplished, most respected LGBTQ rights activists in that whole part of the world. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=889.0s)]
*  He told us today that the parliament in his country has issued notice that it's going to reconsider this bill during tomorrow's session. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=897.0s)]
*  He says members of parliament have confirmed that tomorrow may in fact be the day. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=903.0s)]
*  What that means for us here in this country is that, yes, the Biden administration has already spoken out about this bill. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=907.0s)]
*  But if they are going to turn up the heat on this, if they are really going to try to use their influence to stop this, the time is now. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=914.0s)]
*  The time is right now, as in as in tonight. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=920.0s)]
*  Joining us now from Uganda's capital city of Kampala is Frank Mugisha. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=924.0s)]
*  He's the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=929.0s)]
*  Mr. Mugisha, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=932.0s)]
*  I know I know it's a dangerous time for you to be speaking out. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=934.0s)]
*  And I also know that it's the middle of the night where you are. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=938.0s)]
*  I really appreciate you being here, sir. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=942.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me and thank you so much for amplifying our voice now. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=945.0s)]
*  And back then, when the Kiri Degue bill was just introduced, we appreciate that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=949.0s)]
*  And we did. We need that for our voices to be amplified, not only in Uganda, but also in other parts of Africa where this kind of legislation is being introduced. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=954.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=964.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=965.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, we covered the initial iteration of this bill in 2009 when that was went through a long process when it was eventually shelved. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=967.0s)]
*  Can you tell us about the difference? Is this essentially a continuation of that same idea? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=977.0s)]
*  Is this worse in some ways? Is it similar legislation? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=981.0s)]
*  This legislation is very, very draconian and extreme. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=984.0s)]
*  This legislation, in my words, and I've said it many times, it is here to erase the entire existence of an LGBTQ person in Uganda. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=991.0s)]
*  But also it radicalizes Ugandans into hatred of the LGBTQ community. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1002.0s)]
*  And we're already seeing that happening. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1009.0s)]
*  This could lead to mob justice. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1011.0s)]
*  This could lead to people getting disowned by their own families because it compels every person to report any person who is known as an LGBTQ person to the authorities. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1013.0s)]
*  So this bill is more extreme than the one that was introduced in 2009. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1025.0s)]
*  Compelling other citizens to report fellow citizens, fellow Ugandans who they believe to be gay. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1030.0s)]
*  Tell me, we have seen some coverage in the United States, including, I think, some important reporting in the New York Times about LGBTQ Ugandans fleeing the country, going to Kenya and going to other places, basically trying to avoid the kind of mob justice, the kind of vigilante violence that you're describing. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1040.0s)]
*  What do you think, if this passes, what do you think this law would mean for people who are out, for people who are activists like yourself? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1058.0s)]
*  If this law is passed, we'll definitely see many people get arrested. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1067.0s)]
*  We'll see many LGBTQ persons leave the country. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1072.0s)]
*  So many of the LGBTQ community members are already fleeing the country. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1076.0s)]
*  They're trying to go to neighboring Kenya, which is not safe as well. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1080.0s)]
*  But they feel they would be safer in Kenya than be in prison in Uganda. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1084.0s)]
*  And we're already seeing Ugandans, like I said, radicalized, hating on LGBTQ persons. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1089.0s)]
*  We're seeing violence. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1095.0s)]
*  We're seeing many cases of violence, social exclusion, people getting beaten. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1096.0s)]
*  So we're seeing that increase. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1101.0s)]
*  When this bill is passed or signed by the president, we'll definitely see many of the LGBTQ community members leave the country. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1103.0s)]
*  We'll see many people get arrested. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1112.0s)]
*  People like myself who are outspoken, I could end up getting arrested. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1114.0s)]
*  And many of my colleagues who are outspoken as well could end up being in prison. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1118.0s)]
*  Mr. Maguishy, I just have to ask you if it made a difference for the Obama administration, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1122.0s)]
*  for the U.S. government to speak out against this proposed legislation when we saw an earlier iteration of this years ago. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1128.0s)]
*  And in your opinion, would it make a major difference if the Biden administration, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1135.0s)]
*  if American politicians of all stripes took a firmer stand on this, took a louder stand on this, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1139.0s)]
*  and put pressure on your country's government to not do it? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1146.0s)]
*  Would it make a difference if America stood up? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1149.0s)]
*  It would make a very big difference if Americans spoke directly to our Ugandan authorities [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1151.0s)]
*  and told them how dangerous this legislation is for the LGBTQ community here [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1157.0s)]
*  and how this legislation is going to make the LGBTQ community unsafe living here in Uganda. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1162.0s)]
*  And now this legislation is a gross violation of human rights of LGBTQ persons. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1168.0s)]
*  Yes, it would make a very big difference. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1173.0s)]
*  Frank Maguishy, the executive director of Sexual Minorities Uganda, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1176.0s)]
*  taking a big risk to talk to us live tonight from Kambala. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1180.0s)]
*  Sir, good luck in your work. Thank you and be safe. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1184.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1188.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUteR-_xJw&t=1205.0s)]
