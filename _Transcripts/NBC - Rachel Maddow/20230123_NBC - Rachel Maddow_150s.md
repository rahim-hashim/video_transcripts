# At least seven dead in shootings in Half Moon Bay, CA
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4)
*  We are just getting word, I'm sorry to say, of another apparent mass shooting in California tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=0.0s)]
*  Initial reports are that seven people have been killed in the Half Moon Bay area in California. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Half Moon Bay is just immediately south of the San Francisco Bay Area on the California coast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=13.0s)]
*  What we are learning tonight is that four people have been shot and killed at one site, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=17.8s)]
*  and another three people were shot and killed at a second nearby site. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=23.0s)]
*  The suspected shooter is reportedly in custody. He's being described as a 67-year-old Asian male. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  The seven victims are being described tonight by a city councilperson from Half Moon Bay. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=34.4s)]
*  They're being described as Chinese farm workers. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=40.8s)]
*  But again, that is word of just one local councilperson from Half Moon Bay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  We are pursuing more information on that story. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=48.8s)]
*  But again, this is just terrible news out of Half Moon Bay, California tonight. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=52.4s)]
*  Authorities are saying they do have a suspect in custody and that they therefore believe there is no additional threat to the public tonight in Half Moon Bay. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=55.6s)]
*  But seven people are reportedly dead. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=62.6s)]
*  Authorities are asking the public to avoid Highway 92 between Highway 1 and Highway 35 in Half Moon Bay as this investigation tonight continues. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=65.6s)]
*  Again, two different sites. Seven people found dead already. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=77.6s)]
*  Now, at this point, we do not have any indication of any possible link between this mass shooting in Northern California tonight. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=82.6s)]
*  Half Moon Bay, as I said, just south of the San Francisco Bay Area on the California coast. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=90.6s)]
*  We don't know of any link between this shooting in Half Moon Bay and the Saturday night shooting in Southern California. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=95.6s)]
*  But with 11 people dead in Southern California, seven people dead in Northern California over a 72 hour period, it appears to be Asian Americans targeted in both cases. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=102.6s)]
*  It's obviously very disturbing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=115.6s)]
*  As I said, Congresswoman Judy Chu, who represents the Monterey Park area in Southern California, is going to be joining us live in just a few moments. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=118.6s)]
*  But we will let you know more as we learn more with this developing story. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=125.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56TkZDBCkB4&t=132.6s)]
