# 'He is not the lesser of two evils': Cheney emphasizes severity of Trump threat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c)
*  You look ahead to a year from now, heading into the next election cycle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=0.0s)]
*  If Trump wins, if Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party and he wins and he's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=7.36s)]
*  back in power, what is your life like and what do you think the noble, patriotic, righteous [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  fight is to save the country at that point? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=17.3s)]
*  I don't even want to imagine a situation where he has won. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  I think we have to do everything we can to stop him in terms of, again, the kinds of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=24.52s)]
*  things we've been talking about, working in a very nonpartisan fashion. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=29.4s)]
*  But I also, Rachel, think about it from the perspective of my kids. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=33.68s)]
*  There was a moment right after January 6th where I was having dinner with my husband [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=38.68s)]
*  and our two youngest kids, who happened to be our sons. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=43.28s)]
*  I looked at my sons across the dinner table and I had this realization. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  I grew up in a country where I didn't have to wonder if we were going to have a peaceful [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=52.8s)]
*  transfer of power in the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=56.22s)]
*  All of a sudden it occurred to me, my God, maybe they won't be able to say the same [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=59.2s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  That is why it's so fundamentally important that we ensure Democrats, independents, Republicans, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=64.72s)]
*  that we work together, we vote together, we make clear that Donald Trump is not an acceptable [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  alternative. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=78.12s)]
*  He is not the lesser of two evils. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=79.12s)]
*  He is a completely unfit man for office. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=81.28s)]
*  He's already shown us what he would do and he can never be near the Oval Office again. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=83.88s)]
*  It sounds like you really don't want to think about what resistance or fighting for your [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=87.4s)]
*  country or trying to hold on to democracy looks like with him in power. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=92.28s)]
*  You won't go there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=96.8s)]
*  Well, we're going to be successful at making sure that he's not elected president again. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=97.8s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=102.88s)]
*  And I mean this, I think, coming at it from the understanding that I think I garnered [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=106.84s)]
*  from your book and from what I've come to understand about your spirit about these things, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=110.64s)]
*  which is that after you got voted out of your Republican leadership job in Washington, it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=115.72s)]
*  was very clear you were going to lose your seat in Congress as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=120.28s)]
*  And you didn't quit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=124.56s)]
*  You decided you were going to make them vote you out and not make it any easier for them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=126.36s)]
*  But it would have made it a lot easier for you too. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=132.36s)]
*  Why did you make that decision? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=135.06s)]
*  I don't think it would have made it easier because at the end of the day, the question [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=137.24s)]
*  really is what's more important here? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=143.24s)]
*  And to me, there was no world in which you would say maintaining this House seat matters [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=146.96s)]
*  more than standing up for truth. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  And it became clear that in order to stay in leadership, I was going to have to tell [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=156.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's lies, and I wasn't willing to do that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=160.74s)]
*  But it wasn't a choice for me, and frankly, I don't think it's a choice for any American [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=163.52s)]
*  now given the stakes and given how significant this threat is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSrcO6Bi9c&t=167.4s)]
