# Defying Trump, Americans refuse to be denied their right to protest
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA)
*  So, telling people not to go didn't work. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=0.0s)]
*  Warning people not to go didn't work. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=7.12s)]
*  Trying to intimidate people not to go, that definitely didn't work. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=10.24s)]
*  Even a good faith, earnest, here's a really good reason not to go, kind of cajoling, that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  did not work either. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=22.32s)]
*  We learned definitively in these past few days that people want to protest against this president [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=25.44s)]
*  a lot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=34.24s)]
*  And no matter what you tell them, they are going to do it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=35.4s)]
*  And a lot of people have been wrong about that, including me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=40.04s)]
*  I sat here last week, all earnest and serious, telling you, as if it was true, that there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=44.16s)]
*  definitely was going to be no protest in Washington, D.C. this weekend, that protesters would be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=50.0s)]
*  everywhere else in the country, but they definitely wouldn't be in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=55.92s)]
*  Boy, I was wrong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=60.52s)]
*  The No Kings protest organizers had in fact said no, they were not going to protest in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=62.6s)]
*  Washington. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=66.84s)]
*  They were going to protest everywhere else but there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=67.84s)]
*  But plenty of people protested there in very large numbers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=70.44s)]
*  It wasn't just the No Kings organizers who were saying, oh, we're not going to D.C., [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=77.28s)]
*  don't go to D.C. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=81.0s)]
*  You might remember last week, Trump tried to threaten people against protesting in Washington [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=82.0s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=87.64s)]
*  He said last week that if anybody sort of, you know, dared show up to protest against [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=88.64s)]
*  his big birthday military parade, they'd be met with big and very heavy force trying to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  intimidate people into not protesting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=101.44s)]
*  Turns out that didn't work. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  Regular Americans said, you know what, we're not listening to any of you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  We're Americans and we have the right to protest and that comes from our constitution and not [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=109.04s)]
*  from any of you. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=113.68s)]
*  And so get out of the way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=115.28s)]
*  We don't care. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=116.84s)]
*  We're protesting. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=117.84s)]
*  Lots of people protested in Washington this weekend and there were no problems associated [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=119.4s)]
*  with it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=125.2s)]
*  Protesters mostly did bug out of D.C. before the actual military parade started. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=128.16s)]
*  The military parade itself turned out to have really thin crowds. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=133.6s)]
*  In some places along the parade route, there was almost nobody in the stands. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=136.96s)]
*  Everybody in the president seemed kind of, I don't know, a little bored, maybe a little disappointed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=141.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=146.48s)]
*  Ta-da! [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=147.68s)]
*  It just wasn't a big thing that President Trump put on for 45 million dollars, but they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=148.68s)]
*  got plenty of protesters when people, including me, said they wouldn't be there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=154.4s)]
*  You might have seen headlines last week about the Brevard County, Florida sheriff last week [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=160.4s)]
*  who called a press conference to threaten that he would sick dogs on people and his [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  officers would not just put people in jail, they would put people in the hospital. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  He literally got up at a press conference and said, we will kill you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  Talking about violence he expected at any anti-Trump protests in Brevard County, Florida. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=180.0s)]
*  After that bizarre show of intimidation from that sheriff in Brevard County, Florida, turns [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=185.8s)]
*  out people in Brevard County, Florida were not at all intimidated by what he said, as [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  you can see from local headlines like this one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=196.4s)]
*  Quote, no kings anti-Trump protests draw thousands in Brevard County in Cocoa and Palm Bay. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=198.84s)]
*  The sheriff gets out there and says, we will kill you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=206.68s)]
*  And Brevard County, Florida is like, you know what? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=209.4s)]
*  We got a right to protest. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=211.78s)]
*  We have a right to make protest signs of any kind, including ones that show Donald Trump [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=213.6s)]
*  in a big wig made up like Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=218.2s)]
*  And you are not going to stop us from doing it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=224.2s)]
*  We are Americans. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=226.28s)]
*  We have the right to do this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=227.28s)]
*  We will protest. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  For the most serious possible reason, people were also told not to protest, not to go to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=232.64s)]
*  any no kings protests in Minnesota this weekend on Saturday after news emerged of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  political assassinations of a Democratic former House speaker and her husband and the attempted [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=243.48s)]
*  assassination of another Democratic state legislator and his wife and the even more [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=249.32s)]
*  terrible news on Saturday at that time that that assassin was still at large. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=253.6s)]
*  He has since been brought into custody. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=258.12s)]
*  But on Saturday, authorities advised everyone in Minnesota to cancel their plans to attend [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  any protest. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=266.12s)]
*  And that's a very different kind of thing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=268.0s)]
*  That is a very, very serious thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=269.92s)]
*  But again, people said no. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=273.92s)]
*  People went out and protested in Minnesota anyway, despite those warnings, actually in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  huge numbers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=280.68s)]
*  Look, this is St. Paul, Minnesota on Saturday. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=281.68s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=283.88s)]
*  Look at how many people went out and protested anyway. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=286.32s)]
*  And it is not that people didn't know what had happened. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  You could tell that because a lot of the signs in the crowd were these heartbreaking signs [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  honoring the former Democratic House speaker in Minnesota, Melissa Hortman, and her husband, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=298.66s)]
*  who were both killed by that assassin. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=304.18s)]
*  And even though people were told not to protest in that state that day because the killer [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=308.18s)]
*  was literally still on the loose, apparently there was just nothing that was going to stop [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=312.74s)]
*  people from being there, from standing up, from showing up in huge numbers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  And eventually, state leaders, I think, realized that there was nothing that they could do [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  to stop people from turning out. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=325.6s)]
*  Minnesota State Attorney General Keith Ellison decided to go himself. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=328.18s)]
*  He spoke in St. Paul before that huge crowd. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=331.2s)]
*  He spoke about his friendship with Speaker Hortman. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=333.96s)]
*  He spoke about what it felt like to lose her. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=336.54s)]
*  And he also spoke about the civil rights movement and other martyrs we have had in our country [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=340.38s)]
*  for our democracy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=346.74s)]
*  We owe it to him. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=350.0s)]
*  We have to do it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=352.2s)]
*  We must be there on behalf of the people of this country in this hour when a dictator [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  who wants to be a king is trying to run over the rights of the people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=360.92s)]
*  We must be there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  We must stand up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  We must be strong. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  We cannot waver. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=370.3s)]
*  We will not be intimidated. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  We are not scared of his jail. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  We are not scared of anything about this guy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=375.16s)]
*  We are not afraid. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=378.06s)]
*  And we will not let fear rule the day. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=379.06s)]
*  We will not let him weaponize fear against us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=382.3s)]
*  And I'm telling you now that he had his goons arrest the Senator when he was just trying [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  to ask a question. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  Senator Padilla wrongfully treated. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=398.8s)]
*  He had his other goons prosecute and charge. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=402.36s)]
*  First woman McIver in New Jersey had him arrest the Mayor of New Jersey. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=406.12s)]
*  Threatened to arrest the Governor of California and the Mayor of Los Angeles. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=412.44s)]
*  This is the behavior of a dictator. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=419.48s)]
*  And the only question is what are we going to do about it? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=422.86s)]
*  Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison speaking in St. Paul this week. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL61f-px5OA&t=430.9s)]
