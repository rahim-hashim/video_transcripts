# Fearing Dwindling Options, Ukrainian Mother Flees Basement With Son For Border's Safety
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44)
*  I'm in Budapest, Hungary today, the capital, but I spent the past 10 days on Hungary's border with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukraine. Yesterday, I sat down with a woman who had just escaped Russia's assault on her country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=5.04s)]
*  She had taken her four-year-old son and the few items that she could carry and run away from her [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  home northwest of Kiev. Here's what she told me about her journey and what and who she left behind. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=15.68s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. You've just come here across the border. Where did you come from? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=23.44s)]
*  I came from the Kiev region, the town of Gostomel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=30.0s)]
*  This is the line of fire. It was very hot there. They were bombing and shooting all the time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=36.0s)]
*  Yesterday... [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=44.0s)]
*  And you have this beautiful boy with you. Tell me about him and how old he is. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=46.0s)]
*  My son's name is Lukyan. He's four and a half years old. He's been with me since the beginning of the war, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=52.0s)]
*  that is, since February 24th. We were with him for exactly two weeks. We sat in the basement. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=62.0s)]
*  We almost never went out. He's probably the bravest of our family. He's a spark that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=72.0s)]
*  has always aroused our mood. He said, I'm not afraid of anything, I'm a fighter. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=80.0s)]
*  That's why he supported our family with a fighting spirit and a positive attitude. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=88.0s)]
*  How long has the journey been with him and how was it to be on this long journey with such a young boy? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=94.0s)]
*  We ran away suddenly. We were sitting here until the last minute. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=102.0s)]
*  And the day before yesterday, on March 10th, we decided that we had to do something. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=108.0s)]
*  If not today, then we will never be able to run away. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=116.0s)]
*  That's why we decided with the family that we should go out, not be afraid, go out and watch and run. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=120.0s)]
*  To run, just catch a car, at any cost, you need to run. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=128.0s)]
*  And we just ran out of the basement, having something in the basement, and this is not much, very little. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=134.0s)]
*  We ran out of the basement, to the street, and there we caught a car. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=142.0s)]
*  We caught the car we were driving. Everything was fast, everything was sudden. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=147.0s)]
*  The child was lying on his hands. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=153.0s)]
*  Where is your husband now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=159.0s)]
*  In Ukraine. In Ukraine and at the moment, his place of residence is... [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=161.0s)]
*  I just went to Ukrainian. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=169.0s)]
*  I don't know his exact place of residence, but he is not in the hotel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=173.0s)]
*  He also managed to get out of there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=180.0s)]
*  But I don't know where exactly he is. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=184.0s)]
*  We are trying to call. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=188.0s)]
*  Anna told me that she and her son were headed here to Budapest, where she plans to stay for some time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=192.0s)]
*  Her story is so much like the 255,000 Ukrainians who fled Ukraine for Hungary, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=199.0s)]
*  and the more than 2 million who have fled their country to other countries, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=205.0s)]
*  leaving behind a life and loved ones they can only hope that they are going to see again soon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=209.0s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmi1TjnSr44&t=222.0s)]
