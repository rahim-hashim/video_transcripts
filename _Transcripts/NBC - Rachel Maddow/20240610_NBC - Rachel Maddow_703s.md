# How Republicans are using one state as a testing ground for hijacking an election for Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk)
*  So let's get down to the nitty-gritty here. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=0.0s)]
*  Georgia became this kind of benchmark for principled Republicans refusing to go along with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=4.48s)]
*  improper un-American machinations from President Trump. Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=9.84s)]
*  Brad Raffensperger, two very conservative Republicans both, nevertheless, stood up to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=16.88s)]
*  personal pressure from Trump to overturn President Biden's win in Georgia. And of course, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=22.64s)]
*  all that pressure Trump brought to bear on Georgia Republicans and the ways in which those [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=28.64s)]
*  Republicans resisted, that formed the basis for Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=33.04s)]
*  filing a huge RICO case against Trump and 18 of his co-defendants in Georgia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=40.0s)]
*  So that's one story of the state of Georgia after the 2020 election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=46.56s)]
*  Publicans standing up, the record of them standing up and what they had to stand up against, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=50.56s)]
*  forming the basis for this sprawling, damning criminal indictment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  The other story of Georgia since that election is all the work that pro-Trump Republicans have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=61.84s)]
*  done to make sure nothing like that ever happens again, to make sure nobody can ever again get in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=66.48s)]
*  the way of Trump seizing Georgia's 16 electoral votes, no matter what the votes say. The most [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=71.28s)]
*  obvious thing Georgia Republicans have done is use every tool at their disposal to derail [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=80.56s)]
*  Fannie Willis' prosecution of Trump. In the latest development in that, three Republican-appointed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=85.76s)]
*  judges have just put the whole case on hold while they take their time considering whether Fannie [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=92.08s)]
*  Willis should be disqualified from the case, thus guaranteeing that the Georgia prosecution [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=97.68s)]
*  will definitely not go forward against Trump before the election. But that's only the start. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=103.12s)]
*  In Georgia's most populous county, Fulton County, one Republican elections board member [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=108.56s)]
*  last month refused to certify the primary results there. Because you know, elections are scary. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=113.76s)]
*  With the help of lawyers from a pro-Trump think tank, she has now filed a lawsuit seeking the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=120.64s)]
*  power to block the certification of elections, which would, of course, throw November's results [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=125.28s)]
*  in Georgia into chaos, which is presumably the point. Meanwhile, just north of Fulton County, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=131.12s)]
*  Republicans recently started agitating to take over an elections board in Cherokee County. Now, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=137.84s)]
*  the board there, like other counties in Georgia, has always been evenly split between Democrats [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=144.24s)]
*  and Republicans. But Republicans in Cherokee County are no longer okay with that. They wanted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=149.28s)]
*  a full-scale Republican takeover. When that was blocked, they came up with an ingenious new plan. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=154.16s)]
*  They decided they would replace one of the Democratic commissioners who had been nominated [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=159.44s)]
*  by the local Democratic Party with their own choice. Their own choice for a Democrat, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=163.92s)]
*  a new guy that none of the local Democrats have ever heard of. But don't worry, the Republicans [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  who run Cherokee County swear that this guy they picked is definitely a Democrat. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Republican Cherokee County Commission chairman, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=180.56s)]
*  quote, assured the board that the new member is a Democrat, even if the local Democratic Party [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  is unfamiliar with him. I assure you, he's definitely on your team. I know you've never [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=191.2s)]
*  met and I picked him, but trust me, pinky promise. Meanwhile, at the state elections board in Georgia, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Republicans there just started writing a new rule that would allow county elections boards [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  to conduct a, quote, reasonable inquiry before they certify any election results. So instead of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  signing off on election results, as county election boards are now required to do by law, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=214.88s)]
*  they would be empowered instead to investigate those results as they see fit. The Journal-Constitution [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=219.2s)]
*  notes that, quote, the proposed rule doesn't say what a reasonable inquiry would entail [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=226.0s)]
*  before certifying an election. Yeah, why would you specify that? You definitely want every election [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=230.88s)]
*  denying Republican county elections board member in Georgia just making it up as they go along, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=236.72s)]
*  calling their own behavior reasonable while the presidential election potentially hangs in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  balance. Speaking of that state elections board, one of its Republican members was ousted last [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=247.76s)]
*  month, one of its Republican members was ousted after Trump reportedly spent months calling Georgia [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=254.16s)]
*  Republicans, insisting that that election board member had to go because that person was not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=260.8s)]
*  backing Trump's lies about the 2020 election. And so of course the guy had to go. Trump's personal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  involvement in remaking the Georgia state elections board is just one of the revelations [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=273.92s)]
*  in new reporting from Rolling Stone. Their new piece is headlined, Georgia is our laboratory [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=279.44s)]
*  inside Trump's plan to rig 2024. It details how Trump's allies are working to make sure there will [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  not be a straightforward election result in Georgia this year, given Georgia's swing state status [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=292.0s)]
*  that absolutely could be a deciding factor in how this whole election is going to go down. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  The ultimate authority is the voter. The secretary of state was re-elected by the voters of the state [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=302.4s)]
*  by a larger margin than any other, excuse me, order, order, by a larger margin than any other [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=307.76s)]
*  statewide office. The voters, order, have demonstrated their faith and therefore I do not [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=316.4s)]
*  believe that at present we have the authority to oversee or investigate the secretary of state. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=324.64s)]
*  And Georgia's board of elections gathered to discuss launching an investigation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=334.88s)]
*  into Georgia's secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who had the temerity to say [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=339.2s)]
*  no when Donald Trump demanded he flip the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=343.84s)]
*  The lone Democrat on that elections board spoke out against doing this unprecedented investigation [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=348.56s)]
*  of Raffensperger. As you heard, she was loudly shouted down. In a new article titled Georgia [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=354.48s)]
*  is our laboratory inside Trump's plan to rig 2024, Rolling Stone reports this, quote, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=361.12s)]
*  the former president and his supporters have been making concrete step-by-step progress [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  in shaping electoral processes to his benefit. Across the state, MAGA diehards are devoting [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  considerable resources to purging voter rolls, intimidating election officials, employing legal [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=376.24s)]
*  dirty tricks and ousting Republican officials and election appointees who haven't been initiated [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=381.68s)]
*  into the cult of Trump. Georgia is the sole battleground state in which the Republican [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=386.72s)]
*  party has total control over the levers of power. Over the last four years, Trump-loving [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=391.52s)]
*  elements of the Georgia Republican party have wielded that advantage in a crusade to convert [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=396.64s)]
*  discredited election conspiracy theories into policies well ahead of election day 2024. It's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=401.92s)]
*  an alarmingly anti-democratic experiment that Trump planned and much of the Republican party [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=408.32s)]
*  hope to take national. Joining us now is Adam Ronsley. He's the reporter co-bylined on that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=413.52s)]
*  sprawling Rolling Stone piece. Adam, thanks very much for being here tonight. Appreciate you making [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=419.28s)]
*  the time. Thanks for having me. So what are some of the steps that Trump and his allies have taken [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=423.36s)]
*  to change the electoral process in Georgia? So one of the most alarming ones that a source [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=429.6s)]
*  who has discussed this issue with Trump told us, an attorney, Republican attorney, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=437.6s)]
*  is they're planning to challenge the election result regardless of the result. We think of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=442.24s)]
*  the threat to elections from Trump's behavior in 2020 as only occurring in the event that Trump [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=450.72s)]
*  loses. At the current state of polling, Trump is ahead in Georgia, if you believe the polling, but [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  what Republican attorney who discussed this with Trump told us is that, quote, you can't let the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=463.44s)]
*  left get away with this cheating just because it didn't succeed, air quotes around cheating. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=471.2s)]
*  And the plan is to challenge the result regardless of the outcome. And the intent behind that is [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=478.8s)]
*  essentially a permanent delegitimization of the election process. It is heads I win, tails you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=484.16s)]
*  lose. And I think you had already mentioned this a little bit in your intro, is that one of the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=490.4s)]
*  things that people should be paying close attention to is that refusal to certify in the Fulton County [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=496.4s)]
*  Board of Election in the presidential primary, because one of the things that's very, very [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=504.0s)]
*  notable about that is that the attorneys who filed that lawsuit work for American First [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  Policies Institute, which is a very Trumpy organization filled with former Trump folks. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=517.28s)]
*  And what you see in those kinds of processes is the legal January 6th in miniature. Essentially, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=522.8s)]
*  you're taking someone who is, you know, acting beyond their brief and trying to essentially [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  insert themselves into the counting and, you know, assessment of vote tallies. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=534.72s)]
*  Adam, is this actually a fight in Georgia? You note, I think importantly, that Georgia is a [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=540.9599999999999s)]
*  place where Republicans control all of the levers of power. We just played the sound of one Democratic [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=546.72s)]
*  member of the state elections board getting shouted down when she objected to what they were trying [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=552.72s)]
*  to do in terms of targeting Raffensperger. Is this fight joined where there is pushback against what [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=557.2s)]
*  they're doing, or are they essentially running the table by changing processes to their own benefit? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=564.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, they definitely they definitely have quite a built in advantage. And I think [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=569.52s)]
*  that's why Georgia, you know, relative to other battleground states is particularly interesting [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=575.52s)]
*  because it is more so than perhaps any other state, a fight for the soul of the Republican [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=580.8s)]
*  Party, particularly when it comes to their faith in free and fair elections. And yeah, I mean, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  even folks like Brian Kemp, who was an absolute obstacle to Trump's attempt to, you know, illegally [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=591.84s)]
*  overturn the election in Georgia. You know, Brian Kemp signed SB 202, which is a law that allows for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=598.8s)]
*  a range of, you know, sort of procedural chicanery. Joe Biden called it Jim Crow in the 21st century. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=604.64s)]
*  You know, even folks who have proven themselves to be obstacles to some of the more overt aspects of [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=613.28s)]
*  it sometimes will just go along to get along. And so it they definitely do have an advantage. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=619.76s)]
*  And they are running the table in certain ways. But you do see folks like you mentioned earlier, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=627.52s)]
*  like Ed Lindsey, whose resignation letter we obtained in the story, you know, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=631.84s)]
*  people like that, you still do have these kind of principal Republicans who are willing to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=638.4s)]
*  stand up for what they believe in. But as you saw with the case of Ed, you know, he had resigned [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=642.72s)]
*  under a great deal of pressure from not just President Trump, but from, you know, the grassroots [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=647.36s)]
*  of the party who believe in a lot of election conspiracies. Yeah, the bare fact that a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=652.4s)]
*  presidential candidate is personally lobbying to remove individual state elections board members [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=657.36s)]
*  ought to be on the front page of every paper in the country. It's been reported by Adam [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=664.08s)]
*  Ronsley, reporter at Rolling Stone. Yeah, Adam, Adam, you and Aswant Subha saying, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sLoKCPqkk&t=667.6800000000001s)]
