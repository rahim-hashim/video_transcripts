# The amazing story of how a young Jimmy Carter helped avert a nuclear disaster
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc)
*  The most powerful nuclear reactor in the whole world used to be in Canada, in Ontario, at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=0.0s)]
*  a place called Chalk River Laboratories. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=5.2s)]
*  The reactor was built in the summer of 1947. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=8.4s)]
*  It was used mainly for research purposes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=11.48s)]
*  And one day, about five years into the life of that reactor, in December 1952, the reactor [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=14.56s)]
*  exploded. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=21.16s)]
*  A combination of human error and mechanical failure caused the reactor to melt down, which [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=22.82s)]
*  then set off a series of explosions. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  It is a miracle that no one was hurt. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  But in 1952, this was still uncharted territory, and this was still very dangerous. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=34.8s)]
*  This is, you have to keep in mind, I mean, this is before Fukushima. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=40.08s)]
*  This is before Chernobyl, even. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=43.2s)]
*  This meltdown at Chalk River was the world's first nuclear reactor disaster ever. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=45.32s)]
*  And so even though the explosions of the meltdown didn't kill anybody, they were very concerned [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=51.84s)]
*  about what they were going to do with all the radiation and the ongoing threat of the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=56.94s)]
*  still decomposing reactor. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=61.42s)]
*  There was no model, no instruction manual for how to clean this thing up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=65.14s)]
*  Radioactive material had escaped into the atmosphere. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  The rest of the plant was flooded with radioactive water. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=70.94s)]
*  The reactor itself was still very, very highly radioactive. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=73.98s)]
*  But the whole thing needed to be addressed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't going to take care of itself. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=79.22s)]
*  You couldn't just leave it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=80.62s)]
*  It needed to be shut down and taken apart and then removed from the site so it wouldn't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=81.7s)]
*  cause any more destruction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=88.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, how do you do that without subjecting the people working on that to a deadly amount [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=90.98s)]
*  of radiation? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=94.98s)]
*  To figure it out, the Canadian government enlisted help from the U.S. government and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=97.56s)]
*  specifically from the U.S. Navy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=102.14s)]
*  The U.S. Navy by that time had an elite nuclear submarine program. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=104.22s)]
*  They therefore had a lot of trained engineers who were experienced with nuclear technology. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=108.22s)]
*  Even so, they knew that anybody working on the shutdown effort could only spend about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=113.62s)]
*  90 seconds inside the reactor before they would hit what was considered to be the limit [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=118.18s)]
*  for radiation exposure. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=123.58s)]
*  So what they did, again, back in 1952, was they assembled these crews. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=126.98s)]
*  They thought they were the best people on earth to be able to handle this kind of a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=132.36s)]
*  crisis. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=135.94s)]
*  But then they had to make a very specific plan that would split the whole task of taking [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=137.34s)]
*  apart the nuclear reactor. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=142.84s)]
*  They'd split the whole thing, everything they needed to do, into individual 90-second [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  steps because nobody could do anything inside the reactor that lasted more than 90 seconds. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=149.18s)]
*  So the way it worked was one man would run in and like unscrew a bolt if that would take [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=155.34s)]
*  90 seconds, then he would run out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=161.02s)]
*  Then the next man would run in after his 90 seconds was up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=162.58s)]
*  The next guy would unscrew the next bolt or would do whatever the next step was. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=165.32s)]
*  In order to plan this to these tiny little increments of time, they actually built a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=169.84s)]
*  full-sized replica of the reactor at a nearby playground, and they practiced every single [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=174.32s)]
*  step of the shutdown and the breakdown and the disassembly of this reactor. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  They practiced it all on the replica. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=184.5s)]
*  That is how they took this thing apart. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=188.1s)]
*  One bolt at a time, one 90-second work shift at a time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=189.88s)]
*  It sounds insane, but it actually worked. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=195.12s)]
*  The melted-down reactor was safely disassembled and removed from the site. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=197.76s)]
*  The entire thing actually was reassembled and back up and running safely in just a few [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=204.12s)]
*  years. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=209.44s)]
*  It was, of course, a success that came at great risk to the men who had to run into [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  that radioactive reactor to take it apart bit by bit. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  The man who was in charge of this incredibly risky, incredibly innovative operation was [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  just 28 years old. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=224.48s)]
*  He was a lieutenant in the Navy with nuclear submarine experience. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  He was one of the only men on the entire planet at the time who had the skill set to develop [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=230.56s)]
*  this kind of a plan and to himself go down inside a melted-down nuclear reactor. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=236.12s)]
*  Again, it was a young man at the time, a young man from Georgia. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=241.0s)]
*  His name was James Earl Carter. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  He went by Jimmy for short. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=246.6s)]
*  Before Jimmy Carter became president, before he became a politician of any kind, he was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=250.38s)]
*  in the Navy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=254.28s)]
*  He's actually the only American president to have graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=255.28s)]
*  at Annapolis. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=259.4s)]
*  He served in the Navy for seven years as a submariner. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=260.8s)]
*  That's how he got chosen for the prestigious nuclear submarine program and how he ended [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=264.64s)]
*  up in command of the elite team that saved Canada, this team that saved Ontario from [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=270.0s)]
*  further nuclear disaster after the world's first full-scale nuclear reactor disaster. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=277.12s)]
*  He himself spent 89 seconds, one minute and 29 seconds, inside the chalk point reactor, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=283.62s)]
*  unscrewing his bolt or whatever his one piece of the task was. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=291.22s)]
*  These days, the recommended radiation exposure would be well below what Jimmy Carter endured [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=296.0s)]
*  in those 89 seconds. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=300.46s)]
*  He said later that in testing after the incident, his urine tested positive for radioactivity [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=302.76s)]
*  for six months. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=308.52s)]
*  Today, at 98 years old, almost 70 years since he walked into that nuclear reactor, Jimmy [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=311.8s)]
*  Carter is home with his family. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=317.24s)]
*  He's on hospice care. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=319.12s)]
*  He's in the same town in Georgia where he was born. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=320.76s)]
*  In these, which are likely to be his final days to mark President Carter's service to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=324.56s)]
*  the Navy and to the nation, the U.S. Naval Academy has announced that it's renamed a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  major building on campus in his honor. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  The building was previously named Maury Hall, named after a Confederate naval chief. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=335.96s)]
*  That building has now officially been renamed Carter Hall. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=341.14s)]
*  Well-wishers visited President Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia today. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=345.82s)]
*  People gathered in the auditorium of the high school where the former president and his [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=350.08s)]
*  wife Rosalynn both attended school. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  A historian asked the crowd to take the Carter Challenge. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=356.26s)]
*  He said, do something nice for somebody who needs it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=360.41999999999996s)]
*  If you have someone who needs a phone call, make the phone call. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=364.34s)]
*  If somebody needs a visit, go make that visit. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=367.34s)]
*  The Carter Challenge. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=371.4s)]
*  Hearts of the Nation with President Carter and his family tonight. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e0ClyvdfNc&t=373.5s)]
