# Bipartisan Vote Moves Ketanji Brown Jackson Closer To Confirmation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ)
*  We do have some unexpected and truly historic news tonight concerning Joe Biden's nominee to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the Supreme Court, Judge Katanji Brown Jackson. As predicted today, the Senate Judiciary Committee [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=5.12s)]
*  deadlocked voting along party lines on her nomination. As expected, nearly every Republican [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=10.8s)]
*  member spent their time reiterating the same tired arguments against her confirmation that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=16.32s)]
*  they introduced two weeks ago. But we got some big news tonight about how Judge Jackson's final [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=21.04s)]
*  confirmation vote will turn out because this evening both Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mitt [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=25.92s)]
*  Romney announced that they will vote in support of Judge Jackson. They joined Senator Susan Collins, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=31.28s)]
*  who made clear she would vote for Judge Jackson last week. All three of those Republican senators [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=36.96s)]
*  followed those announcements with votes to discharge Judge Jackson's nomination to the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  Senate floor today. The final vote was 53 to 47. That tees up a final confirmation vote later [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=46.72s)]
*  this week, likely on Friday. And that means Judge Jackson is now firmly on track to make history [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=53.52s)]
*  as the first public defender and the first black woman to be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=59.28s)]
*  And that is some badly needed good news tonight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRJF0BOhBZQ&t=83.52s)]
