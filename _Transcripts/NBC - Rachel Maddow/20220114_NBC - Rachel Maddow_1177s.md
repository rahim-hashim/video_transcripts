# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 13
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg)
*  Person one, the leader of the Oath Keepers, is a guy named Stuart Rhodes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=0.0s)]
*  And yes, that is him with the eye patch. You will be shocked to learn it had something to do with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=4.8s)]
*  the unsafe handling of firearms. Yeah, a little accident with a gun. That's what happened to the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=9.76s)]
*  eye. But ever since the 2020 presidential election, as 17 Oath Keepers were arrested and charged for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=14.64s)]
*  attacking the Capitol in various capacities, as some of those Oath Keepers pled guilty and signed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=22.48s)]
*  cooperation deals with federal prosecutors. Throughout all of this time, the Oath Keepers [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=28.08s)]
*  leader with the eye patch, this guy Stuart Rhodes, has been unavoidable for comment. He has been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=33.44s)]
*  loudly telling any reporter who gets anywhere near him that yes, the election was absolutely [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=38.16s)]
*  stolen from Donald Trump. And yes, he absolutely encouraged Oath Keepers to be in DC on January 6th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=43.92s)]
*  And yes, he was there at the Capitol that day communicating with his fellow Oath Keepers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  But he always takes pains to say that he definitely did not break the law because he is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  way too smart to have done anything illegal. Well, today, Stuart Rhodes was arrested just after [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  lunchtime in Texas. That's his mugshot. Another Oath Keeper guy was arrested in Phoenix around [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=65.52s)]
*  the same time. And they, along with nine other Oath Keepers who had already been arrested and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=72.88s)]
*  charged in the Capitol attack in various capacities, the 11 of them today were all [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=79.44s)]
*  indicted on the very serious charge of seditious conspiracy. Now, seditious conspiracy is a charge [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=84.56s)]
*  that derives from the concept of sedition, right? It is a charge that prosecutors have been openly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=94.24s)]
*  mulling since the very beginning of the investigation. You might remember when the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=99.44s)]
*  Justice Department used to do briefings for the public and the press and the immediate aftermath [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=102.56s)]
*  of the attack, they talked not infrequently at those briefings about seditious conspiracy as a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=106.56s)]
*  potential charge. They did that right away. But now it is, of course, more than a year after the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  attack. This is the first time they have actually used it in the indictment unsealed today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=117.28s)]
*  And seditious conspiracy basically means a conspiracy to commit sedition, a conspiracy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=122.4s)]
*  against the government. Specifically the way that's written in the statute, it's a conspiracy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=128.56s)]
*  to stop the government from carrying out its laws by force. Here's how the indictment [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  describes it. They call it the plot to oppose by force the 2020 lawful transfer of presidential [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  power. Quote, beginning in November 2020, Rhodes, defendant Stuart Rhodes, began disseminating [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=147.28s)]
*  messages on encrypted applications that encouraged his co-conspirators to oppose by force the lawful [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=153.6s)]
*  transfer of presidential power. On November 5th, 2020, two days after the presidential election, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=159.28s)]
*  Mr. Rhodes urged his followers to refuse to accept the election result and stated, quote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=165.52s)]
*  we aren't getting through this without a civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=170.56s)]
*  spirit. Two days later on November 7th, 2020, the day that President Trump was projected to have lost [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=175.76s)]
*  the presidential election, Mr. Rhodes wrote to fellow oath keepers, quote, we must now do what [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=182.72s)]
*  the people of Serbia did when Milosevic stole their election, refused to accept it and march [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=188.4s)]
*  en masse on the nation's capital. He spelled en masse wrong, but that's okay. Mr. Rhodes appears [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=194.32s)]
*  to be in those comments referring to the storming of the Serbian parliament in 2000. Mr. Rhodes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=201.6s)]
*  shared with his followers a video and step-by-step instruction guide to overthrowing the government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  that he said he received from a Serbian activist. That step-by-step guide specifically included [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=215.12s)]
*  storming the parliament. In our country, we don't call it the parliament. We call it the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=220.72s)]
*  capital because it houses our Congress. But same idea. The indictment continues, quote, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  on December 11th, 2020, Rhodes sent a message to fellow oath keepers that stated that if [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=229.52s)]
*  President Biden were to assume the presidency, quote, it will be a bloody and desperate fight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=234.4s)]
*  We are going to have a fight. That can't be avoided. On December 25th, Merry Christmas, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=239.52s)]
*  Mr. Rhodes wrote, quote, I think Congress will screw him, meaning screw President Trump over. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=245.36s)]
*  The only chance we slash he has is if we scare the out of them and convince them it will be [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=250.88s)]
*  torches and pitchforks time if they don't do the right thing. But I don't think they will listen. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=256.8s)]
*  On December 31st, Happy New Year. An Arizona quick reaction force team member [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=262.48s)]
*  message Mr. Rhodes on signal that people were coming to Washington, D.C. and that, quote, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=268.8s)]
*  everyone coming has their own technical equipment and knows how to use it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=273.36s)]
*  Adding a winky face emoji, Mr. Rhodes responded. Awesome. The Arizona Oath Keeper also said the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=276.8s)]
*  group would have rifles and manpower. On January 6th itself, Mr. Stuart Rhodes and his fellow [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=283.6s)]
*  oath keepers did all go to Washington. Many of them were apparently stationed with what they [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=291.6s)]
*  called these quick reaction forces just outside the district where they stockpiled weapons, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=296.4s)]
*  presumably ready to be able to access them on short notice and come blazing in. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=302.32s)]
*  And these, you know, these stacks of oath keepers began heading toward the Capitol and up the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Capitol steps become the sort of point of the spear for actually breaking into the seat of the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=314.64s)]
*  nation's government. According to today's indictment, there was not one but two stacks [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  of oath keepers who breached the Capitol at different places. Apparently one part of one of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=325.52s)]
*  those stacks was specifically looking to try to find Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The indictment says, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  quote, just before 1 30 p.m. in response to a claim by an oath keepers affiliate that Antifa [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=336.0s)]
*  had breached the Capitol, Mr. Rhodes replied, quote, Nope, I'm right here. These are patriots. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  Rhodes then wrote, quote, Pence is doing nothing. As I predicted, all I see Trump doing is complaining. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=347.76s)]
*  I see no intent by him to do anything. So the patriots are taking it into their own hands. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=353.04s)]
*  They've had enough. At approximately 1 30 p.m. oath keepers affiliates on the chat group with Mr. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=358.16s)]
*  Rhodes posted messages about police officers deploying pepper spray at the Capitol and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=365.36s)]
*  questioned what the rioters hoped would happen if they got inside the Capitol. Person with [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=369.20000000000005s)]
*  Rhodes at the time responded, quote, We are acting like the founding fathers can't stand down. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=373.68s)]
*  Stuart and I concur. Mr. Rhodes followed, quote, Hey, the founding generation stormed the governor's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=379.36s)]
*  mansion in Massachusetts and tarred and feathered his tax collectors and they seized and dumped tea [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=384.56s)]
*  in the water. They didn't fire on them, but they street fought. That's where we are now. Next comes [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=389.68s)]
*  our Lexington. It's coming. Just one more thing. I just want to share with you from today's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=395.44s)]
*  indictment because it actually continues beyond January 6th. There's a section of the indictment [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=402.64s)]
*  titled co conspirators continue plotting after the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=407.36s)]
*  Quote, Throughout the evening of January 6th, 2021, the co conspirators discussed the need to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=413.12s)]
*  continue fighting to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power in the weeks after January 6th. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  Rhodes purchased a large volume of firearms and related equipment. The indictment then lists [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=425.68s)]
*  thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars worth of sites and bipods and scopes and mounts [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=432.32s)]
*  and backpacks and gun grips, ammunition, firearms, parts, gun cases, holsters and gun maintenance [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=437.68s)]
*  equipment all purchased by Mr. Rhodes at that time. You see the dates there, January 10, January 11, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=444.0s)]
*  January 12, January 13, January 14 through 19. Adding up all the purchases listed in the indictment [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=450.0s)]
*  that Rhodes made of firearms and related equipment over that short burst of time, he spent something [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=456.24s)]
*  like $40,000 right around January 6th just on weaponry. Quote, On Inauguration Day, January 20th, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=461.6s)]
*  2021, one Oathkeeper messaged another quote, After this, if nothing happens, it's war, civil war 2.0. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=471.12s)]
*  Around this time, quote, Mr. Rhodes messaged others to organize local militias [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=478.88s)]
*  to oppose President Biden's administration. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  For the Oathkeepers, January 6th was not the end point. It was apparently the beginning of a new phase [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=486.4s)]
*  of their fight against the government. As of today, 11 of them are facing seditious conspiracy charges, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=494.96s)]
*  which is a serious felony count brought by U.S. federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, now, as we've been reporting this week, 16 Michigan Republicans went on to sign their names [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=509.2s)]
*  to fake elector documents, claiming that Trump was the rightful winner of Michigan's electoral [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=515.28s)]
*  votes, claiming that they were therefore the rightful electors and should be counted as such. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  They sent those documents to the National Archives, to the United States Senate, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  to be counted as part of Trump's electoral tally. This is the same weird Republican forgery scheme [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=529.04s)]
*  that was apparently being run in at least five states in what appears to have been a coordinated [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=535.92s)]
*  effort. It is now starting to catch the attention, apparently, of multiple investigations that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=540.0s)]
*  are looking into the effort to overturn the election and the attack on January 6th. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=545.2s)]
*  The person who's in charge of Michigan's elections is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=549.5200000000001s)]
*  She and her staff have reportedly spoken to the January 6th investigation in Congress, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=554.0s)]
*  including to provide information about the forged elector documents in her state. We know that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=558.72s)]
*  from a public records request filed by the Detroit News. But we also know this, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  according to a spokesperson for the Attorney General's office in Michigan. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=568.0s)]
*  This matter, the fake elector assertion, these forged documents from Michigan Republicans, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=571.68s)]
*  this is, according to a spokeswoman for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=577.44s)]
*  this is part of an ongoing investigation in the state of Michigan. Joining us now are both [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=581.12s)]
*  Jocelyn Benson, Secretary of State in Michigan, and Dana Nessel, who's Michigan's Attorney General. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=586.64s)]
*  Secretary Benson, General Nessel, thank you both for being here. I really appreciate you both [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=591.12s)]
*  being here. I know it's a coup to have either one of you, but to have you both is a real pleasure. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=595.12s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for having us. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=599.84s)]
*  Let's maybe not take out who's as much because kind of sensitive to that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, Madam Attorney General, let me start with you. We have had questions since we started to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=610.24s)]
*  realize the scope of this scheme as to whether or not this implicates any criminal acts, whether [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  or not it's legal to forge an election related document like this to assert yourself to be in a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=622.32s)]
*  public official effectively when you're not. Is this potentially a matter for the criminal [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=628.48s)]
*  investigation? Yeah, absolutely it is. And I will tell you that we've been evaluating charges [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=634.16s)]
*  for nearly a year now based on these activities as soon as we became aware of that. So I will say [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=641.6s)]
*  under state law, I think clearly you have forgery of a public record, which is a 14 year offense, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=647.36s)]
*  and election law forgery, which is a five year offense. But what we have decided to do with the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=653.28s)]
*  investigation in light of the fact that, of course, we have seen, as you pointed out multiple times [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=658.64s)]
*  now, various different false slate of electors from seven different states in what seems to be [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  a coordinated effort between the Republican parties in various different states. We think [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=670.4s)]
*  this is a matter that is best investigated and potentially prosecuted by the feds. And as such, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=675.68s)]
*  just today, we referred this matter to the Western District, the U.S. Attorney's Office, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=682.0s)]
*  for them to evaluate it. And we hope that Maine justice and the Department of Justice will become [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=688.24s)]
*  involved and use the information they already have to better understand exactly what happened [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=692.88s)]
*  that day so that federal charges can be evaluated. So you, your office, the Attorney General's office [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=698.56s)]
*  in Michigan has referred this matter for potential prosecution to the federal prosecutor's office [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=705.84s)]
*  in Michigan as of today. As of today, we've been evaluating what we were going to do with it. And [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=710.64s)]
*  we had thought that it was very possible that we would be bringing charges. But we still might, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  we still might. And of course, there's no double jeopardy if you were to bring both state and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=723.52s)]
*  federal charges for the same offenses. But obviously, this is part of a much bigger [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=727.84s)]
*  conspiracy. And our hope is that the federal authorities and the Department of Justice [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=734.72s)]
*  and United States Attorney General Merrick Garland will take this in coordination with [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=740.64s)]
*  all the other information they've received and make an evaluation as to what charges these [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=745.76s)]
*  individuals might face. I mean, I can think of many, forgery of a public record for the purposes [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=751.28s)]
*  of defrauding the United States or conspiracy to commit an offense to defraud the United States. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  And there's so many others, but that will be up for the feds to decide. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=762.0s)]
*  And Attorney General Nessel, let me just ask you as a legal matter, you've already referenced this [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=765.44s)]
*  in relation to the idea that this might best be prosecuted as a federal matter because it happened [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=772.0s)]
*  in multiple states. But if we are able to figure out, if the country is able to figure out who did [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  this, I mean, this was a paint by numbers, fill in the blank template that all of these Republicans [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=782.96s)]
*  used in five, at least five different states to do this. If we can figure out who distributed the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=788.4000000000001s)]
*  template, who put them up to this, who told them how to do it, does that change anything about the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=793.44s)]
*  potentially criminal nature or the seriousness of this? I think it does. And I think that you're [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=798.24s)]
*  talking about a conspiracy really to overthrow the United States government. I mean, at the end of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  the day, that's what we're talking about. So why I think it's so important to refer this to the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  federal authorities is because for a lot of these individuals and the irony, of course, is that many [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=816.24s)]
*  of those people that you saw outside the state capitol on December 14th that you showed footage of, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=821.76s)]
*  they're the loudest who complained of election fraud. And yet here they have committed [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=828.16s)]
*  ostensibly the most significant case of election fraud ever in our state's history. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=833.2s)]
*  But, you know, I think it's important that once those individuals see that they could possibly [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=841.6s)]
*  be facing prison time, I do think we're going to see some people flip and we'll get some further [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=847.12s)]
*  information as to who orchestrated this in the first place, who told these people to do this [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=853.04s)]
*  in exactly this fashion. And I think it may go all the way to the top. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=857.52s)]
*  Just to play dumb here a little bit for a second, I think I know the answer to this, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=865.12s)]
*  Secretary Benson, but tell me, tell me true. Is this the sort of thing that has happened before [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=868.64s)]
*  in the state of Michigan? Is this something that you have ever seen in your role as the chief [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=875.44s)]
*  administrator of elections in the state? Is this something that just looks weird to us from a [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=879.44s)]
*  national perspective, but actually people try this kind of thing all the time? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=884.24s)]
*  No, and for good reason. I mean, this is, you know, we up until really 2020 had seen a great [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  deal of respect and deference to our voters, which was really upended in the chaos and confusion that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=894.1600000000001s)]
*  you we saw surrounding the 2020 post-election process. So this is unprecedented. We're in [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  unchartered territory. You know, I know both of us have been asked a lot as this has come out, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=906.72s)]
*  what was legal, what was illegal. And I think it's important to emphasize here that this is [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=911.9200000000001s)]
*  all unprecedented, but it also underscores why it's so important for us to not just ensure truth [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  continues to emerge as to just how far folks were willing to go to overturn a free and fair election, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=923.2800000000001s)]
*  just because they didn't like the results, because we not only need to see justice and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=929.52s)]
*  accountability in this manner for those who broke the law, but we need to work to put protections [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=933.68s)]
*  in place to ensure we do not see a repeat of these nefarious tactics in future elections. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=938.56s)]
*  So this is the dissent. This is from the start of the dissent from Justice Elena Kagan, Justice [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Stephen Breyer. I bring this to you tonight because every once [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  in a while the dissent is just destined to ring louder in history than the ruling, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=958.4s)]
*  and this has all the markers of that tonight. Quote, every day COVID-19 poses grave dangers [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  to the citizens of this country and particularly to its workers. The disease has by now killed [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=971.76s)]
*  almost one million Americans and hospitalized almost four million. It spreads by person-to-person [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=976.88s)]
*  contact in confined indoor spaces, so causes harm in nearly all workplace environments. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=982.64s)]
*  And in those environments, more than any others, individuals have little control and therefore [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=989.04s)]
*  little capacity to mitigate risk. COVID-19, in short, is a menace in work settings. The [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=993.28s)]
*  proof is all around us. Since the disease's onset, most Americans have seen their workplaces [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1000.0s)]
*  transformed. So the administrative agency charged with ensuring health and safety in workplaces [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1004.72s)]
*  did what Congress commanded it to do. It took action to address COVID's continuing threat [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1011.36s)]
*  in those spaces. OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, issued an emergency [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1017.2s)]
*  temporary standard requiring either vaccination or masking and testing to protect American workers. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1025.52s)]
*  The standard falls within the core of the agency's mission to protect employees from grave danger [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1032.96s)]
*  that comes from new hazards or exposure to harmful agents. OSHA estimates, and there is [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1039.52s)]
*  no ground for disputing, that the standard they proposed would save more than 6,500 lives [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1046.08s)]
*  and prevent over a quarter million hospitalizations just in six months' time. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1054.0s)]
*  Yet today, the court issues a stay that prevents the standard from taking effect. In our view, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1060.48s)]
*  the court's order seriously misapplies the applicable legal standards and in so doing, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  it stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat that COVID poses [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1070.32s)]
*  to our nation's workers. Acting outside of its competence and without legal basis, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1075.1999999999998s)]
*  the court displaces the judgments of the government officials given the responsibility [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1080.0s)]
*  to respond to workplace health emergencies. Quote, we respectfully dissent. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  Justice Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer dissenting today from the ruling by the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1091.12s)]
*  conservatives on the Supreme Court, which did block the OSHA workplace safety rule for large [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1100.0s)]
*  employers that would have required workers to either be vaccinated or to get regularly tested. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1104.9599999999998s)]
*  Now, in a separate ruling today, the court did leave in place the vaccine requirement for people [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1111.28s)]
*  who work in a healthcare setting. But if you don't work in a healthcare setting, if you're [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  stacking shelves or you're on the factory floor or working in a big open plan cubicle farm and [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1119.44s)]
*  your workplace doesn't want to try to protect you from a COVID rich environment, well, the Supreme [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1124.88s)]
*  Court just blocked the Biden administration from helping you. The Supreme Court just blocked the [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1130.4s)]
*  Biden administration from being allowed to require that your workplace be made more safe. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1134.8s)]
*  It's not necessarily an unexpected ruling given how right wing the Supreme Court is right now and [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1142.72s)]
*  how weird and scientifically uninformed the conservative justices questions were during [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1148.32s)]
*  the oral arguments. But now it is done. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFFobhPAtg&t=1153.84s)]
