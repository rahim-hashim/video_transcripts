# Maddow: JD Vance wants to destroy anything conservatives can't control
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU)
*  The Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce paid Elizabeth Dilling to come to Southern California, where [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=0.0s)]
*  she assured everyone that she had confirmed that UCLA was a hotbed of communism, presumably [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=5.2s)]
*  also free love. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=11.16s)]
*  She did the same thing at Cornell. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=13.06s)]
*  She did the same thing at Northwestern, trying to get all of these universities shut down. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=14.74s)]
*  They wanted all of these universities shut down as evil, subversive communist institutions. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=18.78s)]
*  They did not get the universities shut down. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=24.12s)]
*  But a lot of very rich, very influential people were working on this as what they thought [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=27.36s)]
*  was like a mainstream political project. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=31.0s)]
*  As weird as it sounds, this is a thing they really put at the center of their agenda. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=33.56s)]
*  And the expert who they had work on all these campaigns, Elizabeth Dilling, she was a piece [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  of work on her own. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=46.16s)]
*  Not to put too fine a point on it, but she was a huge fan of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=48.64s)]
*  Party. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And before we got into World War II, the Nazis in Germany actually paid her expenses for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=54.12s)]
*  her to repeatedly visit Germany and then go back to the U.S. and praise the Nazi Party [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=59.0s)]
*  and Hitler's leadership. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=64.28s)]
*  The German press had a nickname for Elizabeth Dilling. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=65.78s)]
*  They called her the female Fuhrer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=68.02s)]
*  She wrote a whole series of wildly anti-Semitic books about how Jews were secretly plotting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=71.72s)]
*  to destroy the world and everybody needed to rise up against the Jews. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=77.96s)]
*  Elizabeth Dilling was really something. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=81.84s)]
*  She was put on trial for sedition in 1944. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=83.2s)]
*  When the trial dragged on for months, the judge actually allowed her to take breaks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  from attending the trial every day so she could go back to her day job and pay her bills. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Her day job was helping organize political rallies for the America First Party, where [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=94.72s)]
*  her specific job was leading the crowd in anti-Semitic songs, which she wrote herself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=99.4s)]
*  Elizabeth Dilling was bananas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  But this crusade to shut down the universities, to expose universities, subversive institutions [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=110.4s)]
*  that have to be shut down if we're going to save America, this has been sort of a recurring [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=116.6s)]
*  thing on the far right for a long time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=121.88s)]
*  I mean, that all happened in the 30s. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=124.0s)]
*  But when Barry Goldwater was the Republican nominee for president in 1964, one of the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=129.44s)]
*  minor scandals in his campaign, which had a lot of scandals, is that his campaign employed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=135.32000000000002s)]
*  a full-time campaign worker whose organization had been shut down by the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=140.4s)]
*  government during World War II because it was an American fascist organization. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  The guy's name was Alan Zoll. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=153.8s)]
*  He then reorganized himself into something called the National Council for American Education, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=155.4s)]
*  which investigated American universities for a subversion and tried to shut them down for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=162.12s)]
*  being communist or whatever. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=167.88s)]
*  He put out pamphlets with titles like, they want your child. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=169.36s)]
*  Alan Zoll also somewhat famously testified in Congress that Felix Frankfurter shouldn't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=174.36s)]
*  be approved as a Supreme Court justice specifically because he was Jewish. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=178.72s)]
*  He said that was the grounds on which he thought that he shouldn't be confirmed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=183.36s)]
*  The shutdown the universities thing has been an obsession on the far right on and off for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=189.8s)]
*  a very long while. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  And its most famous proponents have just not been the best people, just objectively. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=197.02s)]
*  They have mostly been associated with not just the far right, but literally with fascism. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=201.94s)]
*  Alan Zoll's organization was banned by the U.S. government as a fascist group. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  Elizabeth Thilling was a fascist Nazi and Hitler enthusiast who spent her life crusading [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=212.36s)]
*  against Jewish people and who was put on trial for sedition. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=217.5s)]
*  The shutdown the universities thing does not have a good pedigree on the American far right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=221.82s)]
*  But it comes up in a recurring way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=229.2s)]
*  And we do have some new proponents of it now, which I think we should all be aware of, particularly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=232.14s)]
*  ahead of tomorrow's vice presidential candidates debate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=237.78s)]
*  I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=243.5s)]
*  the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=247.06s)]
*  this country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=252.22s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the universities do not pursue knowledge and truth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=253.22s)]
*  They pursue deceit and lies. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=257.54s)]
*  And it's time to be honest about that fact. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=259.56s)]
*  Of course, I imagine that I don't have to convince any more of any of you that this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=261.1s)]
*  is preposterous, that the universities in our country are fundamentally corrupt and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=265.54s)]
*  dedicated to deceit and lies. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=270.36s)]
*  And our universities are so committed to some of the most preposterous dishonest sees [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=271.9s)]
*  in the world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=277.06s)]
*  J.D. Vance is now the Republican nominee for vice president of the United States. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=278.06s)]
*  This is a speech he gave not that long ago where the title of the speech was The Universities [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=284.44s)]
*  Are the Enemy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=289.58s)]
*  He gave this speech less than three years ago in Florida. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  But the theme of this speech, this is sort of a recurring thing for him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=297.46s)]
*  You come to America, you learn that America is an evil place. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=302.22s)]
*  You go to Harvard, you put your preferred pronouns in your biography and you learn to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=306.98s)]
*  hate the people who live in the American heartland, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=310.42s)]
*  Harvard University Endowment, $41 billion of money. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=313.06s)]
*  A lot of that is going to aggressively promote left-wing radicalism. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=316.82000000000005s)]
*  Harvard University Endowment funds some of the most radical anti-American stuff that's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  out there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  Harvard University Endowment pays a 0 percent tax rate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  Maybe it's time to tax that endowment. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  Seize the endowment, actually penalize these endowments for being on the wrong side of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=330.94s)]
*  some of these cultural issues. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=336.38s)]
*  The service have got to wake up to this reality. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=337.58s)]
*  So yes, I think there are ways for us to seize the endowments. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=339.86s)]
*  We just have to be willing to actually do it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=343.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=345.18s)]
*  I like that answer. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=346.18s)]
*  I like that answer. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=347.18s)]
*  This is a podcast interview that J.D. Vance did, again, not that long ago. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=349.5s)]
*  Elizabeth Dilling didn't succeed in shutting down the University of Chicago or the University [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=356.22s)]
*  of Michigan or UCLA. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=360.66s)]
*  The fascist activist Alan Zoll didn't succeed in getting Harvard shut down when he tried [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=362.26000000000005s)]
*  it in 1949. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=367.18s)]
*  But J.D. Vance has a plan to do it now, at least to seize Harvard's endowment and then [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=368.18s)]
*  see what happens. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  And he has a plan to do this as part of a larger plan to destroy all the things which [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  conservatives don't have complete control over. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=382.48s)]
*  And it's not just the universities, which is, again, on and off for a century, been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=386.58s)]
*  a topic of concern to the far right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=392.26s)]
*  But it also, for J.D. Vance, includes the private sector, businesses. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=395.53999999999996s)]
*  Here he is in that same interview explaining that the right wing needs to start doing stuff [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=400.82s)]
*  that's really, really, really radical, including to businesses. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  And both J.D. Vance and his interviewer both clearly find this very exciting. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=409.74s)]
*  Look, capital money itself is increasingly taking a side in the culture war. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=415.9s)]
*  And I hate to say it's not our side. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=421.5s)]
*  It's not the side that I want to win. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=423.26s)]
*  Unless you're willing to make these people feel economic pain, there is no serious way [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=424.94s)]
*  to fight back against it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  The only way to push back against this stuff in a real way is to make these companies feel [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  economic pain. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=435.23999999999995s)]
*  And so there are a lot of ideas out there for how to do it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=436.62s)]
*  If you're not recognizing in this moment how crazy things have gotten and how outside the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=439.17999999999995s)]
*  box we need to think, then I think you're ultimately not really serious about taking [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=444.34s)]
*  back the country. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, look, I agree. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  We are in the late Republican period. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=451.02s)]
*  If we're going to push back against it, we have to get pretty wild and pretty far out [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=452.17999999999995s)]
*  there and go in directions that a lot of conservatives right now are uncomfortable with. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=455.26s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=460.06s)]
*  I got to say among some of my circle, the phrase extra constitutional has come up quite [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=461.05999999999995s)]
*  a bit. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=465.94s)]
*  We do need to take a much more aggressive stance, a much more muscular stance. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=466.94s)]
*  You're going to have to, you know, become a little bit more robust in our behavior. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9ek-84zaU&t=470.58s)]
