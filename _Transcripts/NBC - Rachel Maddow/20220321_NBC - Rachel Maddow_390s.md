# Putin's Anti-NATO Rampage Backfires As Neutral Countries Look For Protection
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q)
*  NATO allies are set to meet this week, likely against the backdrop of a protracted war in Ukraine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  that will put considerably more Ukrainian civilian lives at risk. And it's a war that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=7.68s)]
*  the Ukrainian president Zelensky is arguing could have been avoided altogether, saying this weekend [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=13.36s)]
*  that, quote, if we were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started. And further calling on NATO [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=18.56s)]
*  to give Ukraine some sort of clarity as to whether or not they will ever, ever be able to join the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=23.84s)]
*  alliance. Joining us now is Heather Connolly, president of the German Marshall Fund. She's also [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=29.2s)]
*  a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian affairs, where she co-led the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  U.S. interagency effort to enlarge NATO. Heather, good to see you. Thank you for joining us again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=40.0s)]
*  Certainly the growth of NATO in the beginning and then subsequent to the collapse of the Warsaw [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Pact and the fall of the Berlin Wall, it's not clear, I think, to most of our viewers, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=51.76s)]
*  how these former Warsaw Pact countries came to be NATO countries and why some of them didn't. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=56.32s)]
*  But what's the what's the the Cliff Notes version of that and and what Zelensky is asking for? Let [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=62.72s)]
*  us in now. Well, the Cliff Notes is the Washington Treaty, which established the North Atlantic Treaty [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Organization in 1949. There's an article, Article 10, that says a membership is available and open [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=76.88s)]
*  to those European countries that can assume the responsibilities of becoming a NATO member. So [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=85.6s)]
*  this is why NATO enlargement has proceeded since 1949 up to now 30 members of NATO. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=92.64s)]
*  Obviously, as NATO expanded, it becomes more challenging to make decisions at 30, but it is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  a strong and vibrant alliance. Now, the members that want to join NATO, yes, NATO members have to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=108.0s)]
*  accept them. And we closely scrutinize every aspirant country's application. They have to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=116.16s)]
*  have a strong defense. They have to have, you know, strong democracies and being able to accept the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=123.36s)]
*  responsibility. So it's not just a let us in. It is a process, but it is open to all European countries [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=130.4s)]
*  that can accept those responsibilities. So the thing is, it's very difficult to bring in a member [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=137.76s)]
*  when you have such a dramatic situation at hand. But I will tell you what Vladimir Putin is doing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  is making more countries want to join NATO, neutral countries like Sweden, like Finland, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  because the Russians are really threatening their freedom of choice to join alliances. So the more [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=155.84s)]
*  threatening Vladimir Putin becomes, the more countries that want to seek the security umbrella [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  of NATO. So he's creating these conditions in 2014. The Ukrainian constitution [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=167.84s)]
*  ensured that Ukraine was a neutral country by annexing Crimea and invading Donbass in 2014. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=173.12s)]
*  It was Vladimir Putin who forced the Ukrainian government to change its constitution to want [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=179.76s)]
*  to be more closely aligned with NATO. So again, Moscow has to accept its strategic failures. The [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=184.96s)]
*  more it takes these actions, the more countries want to join NATO. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=190.16s)]
*  That was such a great crystal clear explanation about why countries join, how they join. So thank [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=193.84s)]
*  you for that. But now I want to get your reaction to the other thing that President Zelensky said [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=202.32s)]
*  over the weekend, arguing that, quote, if we were a NATO member, this war would not have started. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=206.08s)]
*  Those were his words. Is he right? What would this war never have taken place? Would Russia have just [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=211.44s)]
*  not done it not gone across the border if Ukraine were a NATO member? Because really, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=217.28s)]
*  the second part of my question is that countries like I'm in Poland really do fear Russian [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=221.52s)]
*  expansionism and they feel that if they get away with Ukraine, the Russians could just continue [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=226.24s)]
*  to move further west or northwest and take other countries. Is that possible? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think there is some truth to what President Zelensky said, because you look at [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=235.28s)]
*  the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland is another example. When these [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=239.12s)]
*  countries joined NATO, they did have a strong sense of defense, of deterrence, of reassurance [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=244.96s)]
*  that should Russia become the Russia that it is today, an aggressor state, a revisionist state, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=254.08s)]
*  they would be protected. This is what President Zelensky is asking for Ukraine right now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  The challenge is, Ali, it's the geopolitical conditions that allow this membership to proceed. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=264.8s)]
*  We had two geostrategic openings, particularly in 1999, that brought in Poland, Hungary, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  and the Czech Republic. In 2002, the NATO enlargement round that I was involved in, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  it brought in the three Baltic states, as well as Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  NATO has continued to enlarge even past that point, but it was that we had that opportunity [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  to do it, but now we have a very different Russia. We have to bring that into consideration. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=293.44s)]
*  NATO enlargement is not done. That geopolitical window will open. This is where we have to have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  the closest possible relationship between NATO and Ukraine, between NATO and other former Soviet [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=305.12s)]
*  states like the Republic of Georgia, because when that geopolitical window opens, we want their [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  candidacy to be strong, them to be in the best position for NATO and the European Union, if that's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  possible, to continue to expand eastward. That's what Mr. Putin fears. This is really not, though, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=325.52s)]
*  Ali, let me be very clear. It's not about membership in NATO. It's not membership in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=331.44s)]
*  the European Union. What Vladimir Putin fears is the freedom of choice and the dignity of the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=335.44s)]
*  individual. He cannot allow that in Russia and retain his power. If Ukraine becomes a thriving, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=341.28s)]
*  prosperous, and secure democracy, that is his greatest threat. And membership in NATO or [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=348.4s)]
*  membership in the European Union just represents that freedom of choice and that dignity. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=354.4s)]
*  And that is what Mr. Putin will not allow to stand in Ukraine. And he's trying to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=359.84s)]
*  destroy Ukraine before he allows them to join that family of democracies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=364.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzShltmny3Q&t=384.4s)]
