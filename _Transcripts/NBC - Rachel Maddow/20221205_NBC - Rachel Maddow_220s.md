# How To Understand The New York Investigations Of, And Cases Against, Donald Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE)
*  Joining us now is Rebecca Royfee. She's a former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=0.0s)]
*  DA's office where the new senior counsel Matthew Colangelo will be working. She's now a professor [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=3.44s)]
*  at New York Law School. Ms. Royfee, thank you for being here. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=7.36s)]
*  DA's office or AG's office? DA's office. So the AG's office and the DA's office, aside from the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=11.36s)]
*  fact that we call them by their initials. Yes. It's frustrating. Tell me about what it means to have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=16.96s)]
*  somebody who had that kind of experience in the New York attorney general's office coming into [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  the DA's office. I think particularly those of us people watching from outside New York don't [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=28.24s)]
*  necessarily know the difference between these offices and what their different remits might be. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=32.96s)]
*  Right, right, right. So the DA's office is primarily a prosecutorial office. It does [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=36.32s)]
*  criminal cases and the attorney general in New York primarily has responsibility for civil cases. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=41.2s)]
*  It has some jurisdiction over criminal cases, but less so. So the fact that he's coming over here [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  probably does mean that he's not because of his experience prosecuting cases. It's because of his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=51.28s)]
*  experience supervising important major investigations and particularly this investigation [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=56.24s)]
*  into the former president. And I think we generally think of civil cases. Again, those of us who aren't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=61.92s)]
*  lawyers, we tend to think of civil cases as citizen A suing citizen B. In the case of these [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=66.4s)]
*  civil cases brought by the New York attorney general's office, I think the one that might be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=71.84s)]
*  more clarifying for us is one that was covered very closely in the press, including here on this show, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=75.44s)]
*  which was Trump operating what was alleged to be essentially a fake charity using this Trump [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable instrument to instead put money in his own pockets [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=85.44s)]
*  and do political favors for himself. The result of that civil lawsuit was the shutdown of the Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=89.28s)]
*  foundation, which tells you something about what kind of teeth there can be in these findings in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=95.2s)]
*  these civil cases. Matthew Colangelo was lead on that. Right. A hundred percent. So it's kind of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=99.2s)]
*  like a civil case where the victim is the public, where instead of being like, you know, somebody [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=104.32s)]
*  suing somebody else because that person was hurt, suffered some kind of damages. Instead, it's like [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=108.32s)]
*  the public suffered damages. So there's a civil case that's brought on the public's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=113.6s)]
*  behalf. That's what the attorney general is doing. Yeah. So in this case, what Mr. Colangelo, as you, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  as you said, them bringing him on as a senior counsel, putting out, they gave an exclusive to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=122.72s)]
*  the New York Times. They put a press release out thereafter. They obviously want people to know [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=126.8s)]
*  this is happening. They're not naming him as a person working on Trump things, but because he [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=130.32s)]
*  doesn't have experience in the past as a criminal prosecutor, it is his expertise related to Trump [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=135.28s)]
*  that he, that he sort of brings with him as his baggage into this. The reason, presumably, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=142.64s)]
*  they brought him on board. Should we surmise from that, that some of the facts and some of the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  understanding that he garnered during these civil investigations will now result in criminal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=153.6s)]
*  charges being brought against Trump on related matters? You know, I think it's an exaggeration [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  to say from this, we can read that there will necessarily be some kind of indictment involving [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  the same facts as were involved in those civil cases, but I think we can draw the conclusion that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=168.32s)]
*  these cases and investigations are extensive, potentially extensive and ongoing. And that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=174.64s)]
*  itself is significant because there was some question back when, you know, several prosecutors [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=180.88s)]
*  left the office about whether in fact that was true. I think now we can pretty much say to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  ourselves, okay, these investigations are going on and they probably don't have to do with, you [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=189.12s)]
*  know, some small issue that can be resolved by the office itself, but rather are extensive and complex. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ujXhTCREE&t=193.76s)]
