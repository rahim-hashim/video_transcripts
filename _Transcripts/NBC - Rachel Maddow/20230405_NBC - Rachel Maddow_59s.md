# 'We're not takin' it': Maddow explains why MSNBC won't air Trump's Mar-a-Lago speech live
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo)
*  Just as a moment of business here, and then I'll come to you in just one second, I need to tell you that right now the former president himself is making remarks tonight from his home in Florida. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo&t=0.0s)]
*  As far as we can tell, and what we're prepared for here is that this is basically a campaign speech in which he is repeating his same lies and allegations against his perceived enemies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  It is just getting started. So far, he's just giving his normal list of grievances. We don't consider that necessarily newsworthy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo&t=17.48s)]
*  And there's a cost to us as a news organization of knowingly broadcasting untrue things. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo&t=23.72s)]
*  So our deal with you is that we will monitor these remarks. If he does say anything newsworthy, we will turn them around and report on that right away. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo&t=28.36s)]
*  But for now, just know that it's happening and we're not taking it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2mV44AIo&t=35.519999999999996s)]
