Video Description: Even with new polling showing significant disapproval among Americans of Donald Trump's handling of the economy, Trump's indifference to tanking the stock market did not waver. But when his ill-considered tariff scheme began to affect the bond market, even Trump knew it was time to dial back his one-man global trade war.

# Trump caves on tariffs: One economic indicator made even Trump realize he'd gone too far
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI)

*  Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling foreign policy? Disapprove by a margin of 14 points [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=15.08s)]
*  Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling the economy? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=21.46s)]
*  Disapprove by a margin of 15 points [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=27.02s)]
*  It's do you approve or disapprove of the way Trump is handling trade? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=29.26s)]
*  Disapprove by a margin of 16 points. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=33.34s)]
*  All right, well, you know, how about this one? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=35.78s)]
*  How about his signature issue, a thing that he actually did run on when he campaigned [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=38.58s)]
*  for president, a thing he really most wants to be associated with, the policy that he [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=43.78s)]
*  most wants you to identify with him and his name? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=48.34s)]
*  Do you think, American public, do you think it is a good thing, his signature issue? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=51.34s)]
*  Here's the way the question was phrased. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=57.78s)]
*  Thinking about the short term, do you think President Trump's tariffs will help or hurt [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=59.02s)]
*  the U.S. economy? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=64.58s)]
*  The proportion of Americans who say Trump's tariffs gonna help? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=66.42s)]
*  22%. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=69.86s)]
*  The proportion of Americans who say Trump's tariffs will hurt us is 72%. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=71.14s)]
*  So by a 50 point margin, Americans believe that Donald Trump is deliberately hurting [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=77.94s)]
*  us with his big signature policy idea of these genius tariffs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=85.3s)]
*  By a 50 point margin, Americans say what he's doing is hurtful to us deliberately. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  Which brings us to what I mentioned at the top, our spelunking expedition together this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=99.41999999999999s)]
*  evening, our exploration of caves. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  The incident of Donald Trump caving today that's getting the most attention, understandably [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  is his panicked cave, his panicked U-turn on tariffs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=114.86s)]
*  For all his famed and supposed attention to the stock market, I gotta tell you, Donald [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=121.1s)]
*  Trump has been very happy to preside over huge off the cliff plunges in the stock market [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=126.66s)]
*  repeatedly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=131.7s)]
*  In fact, in history, if you look at the Dow Jones, if you look at the 10 largest single [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=132.7s)]
*  day point drops in the Dow in history, of the 10 worst point drops ever on the Dow, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=137.86s)]
*  Donald Trump was the president for nine of those 10 days. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=147.1s)]
*  Somewhere in his first term, somewhere this past week with the tariffs debacle. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=151.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=156.18s)]
*  He was president for nine of the 10 worst one day point drops on the Dow. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=157.9s)]
*  And you might say the takeaway message there is, wow, why would any Wall Street person, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  any business person, anyone with a single share of stock, anyone with a retirement account, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=168.94s)]
*  why would any of those folks ever support this particular person for president? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=173.66s)]
*  Reasonable question. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  But the other takeaway here is about him and not just how good or not he is for stocks. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  The other takeaway here, I think it's fair to say, is that he doesn't much care about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=188.44s)]
*  tanking the stock market all the time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=192.46s)]
*  It's like a day that ends in Y for him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=196.1s)]
*  He's famous for doing it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=198.26000000000002s)]
*  What happened today that was different after all his remaining tariff threats went into [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  effect at midnight last night, what happened today was not that the stock market tanked. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=205.86s)]
*  It did at the beginning of the day with the tariffs in place, but that's again normal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=211.34s)]
*  for a day with Donald Trump at the wheel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=214.78s)]
*  What was different today was not that the stock market tanked again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=217.62s)]
*  It was that the bond market tanked at the beginning of the day. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=221.62s)]
*  And you don't have to know that much about the markets to know that when things go crazy [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=227.9s)]
*  economically, even sometimes when things just go crazy in other ways, people rush to put [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=232.54s)]
*  their money somewhere safe. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=237.52s)]
*  And for decades, for the entire span of America's global economic dominance, the safe place [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=239.94s)]
*  run to when stuff is crazy has been U.S. bonds, American treasury bonds, because when the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=246.78s)]
*  world is going nuts, for whatever reason, you can at least count on the full faith and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=252.34s)]
*  credit of the government of the United States of America. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=256.22s)]
*  But we're in a new environment now, because it turns out something different happens when [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=258.82s)]
*  the reason things are crazy is that the U.S. government itself is crazy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=265.94s)]
*  It's that the U.S. president has grabbed the wheel and he doesn't drink, so we know [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=271.58s)]
*  he's not drunk, but boy, he sure is driving like he's drunk. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=275.9s)]
*  I mean, when the problem is the actions of the U.S. government, instead of fleeing to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=278.38s)]
*  the U.S. government for safety, now people flee away from the U.S. government to find [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=284.38s)]
*  safety. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=290.58s)]
*  And so unlike every other economic crisis in modern history, people in this economic [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  crisis induced by Donald Trump, people today, at the beginning of the day, started selling [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=299.70000000000005s)]
*  their U.S. treasuries a lot, a lot, a lot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  And that is not just an inversion of typical economic behavior. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=308.66s)]
*  That indicates an inversion of America's role in the world as the dominant economy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=314.26000000000005s)]
*  Also, in practical terms, a sell-off like that in the U.S. bond market. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=320.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, that portends a way bigger economic disaster for the United States than Trump [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=329.46s)]
*  tanking the stock market over the past week. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=337.46s)]
*  The bond market falling apart is a much bigger deal than the stock market falling apart in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=341.14s)]
*  terms of the fundamentals of who we are in the world and how our money and our economy [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  works, because the stability of the U.S. bond market is what we depend on essentially for [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=351.3s)]
*  the spine of our economy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=356.18s)]
*  From the mortgage rates in the housing market to the integrity of our multi-trillion dollar [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=358.62s)]
*  national debt. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=363.9s)]
*  So yes, the stock market stuff under Trump has been scary. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=365.66s)]
*  But if the bond market blows up, say goodbye to the U.S. economy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=369.66s)]
*  And today, what happened is the bond market started blowing up. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=375.7s)]
*  When that happened at the opening of the bond markets today, that's apparently what turned [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=381.42s)]
*  things around. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=388.42s)]
*  That's how we discovered this lovely cave that Donald Trump led us into today on his [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=389.98s)]
*  tariff policy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=394.46000000000004s)]
*  NBC News reports tonight that Trump cave, Trump reversed course on his tariff gambit [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  today because of, quote, deep concern bordering on panic from his top economic officials regarding [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=399.74s)]
*  the bond markets. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, not always allies [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=409.3s)]
*  in the various tariff debates at the White House, nevertheless presented a united front [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=414.02000000000004s)]
*  today to the president urging a pause on what he was doing on tariffs, a pause, quote, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=418.0s)]
*  over concerns about the bond markets. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=425.24s)]
*  My colleague Chris Hayes, I think, nutted up what happened here very well today. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=430.08s)]
*  He posted this on Blue Sky. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=433.32s)]
*  Quote, you set the house on fire, watched it burn, and then lost your nerve and put [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=435.44s)]
*  it out. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=441.84s)]
*  You now have a partially burned house. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=443.06s)]
*  Great job. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=445.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UawcxhVw4TI&t=447.9s)]
