# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk)
*  Last month, on March 6th, the McCurtain County Commission held one of their normal meetings, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=0.0s)]
*  which are usually boring affairs for all the right reasons. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=6.16s)]
*  But staff from the McCurtain Gazette News went to that meeting to cover it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=10.48s)]
*  And after the meeting, the longtime publisher of the paper, a man named Bruce Willingham, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=15.56s)]
*  he decided he was going to do something out of the ordinary. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=20.48s)]
*  He decided to leave a voice-activated recorder inside the room where the commission meets. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=23.76s)]
*  And the reason he did that is because he suspected that the county commission in McCurtain County [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  was continuing to do county business after the meeting had ended. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=35.36s)]
*  And that would have been in violation of the state's Open Meeting Act. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=41.72s)]
*  This publisher from the local paper essentially thought that the commission was trying to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=44.42s)]
*  business affecting the people of the county without looping the public in to what they were doing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=49.76s)]
*  And that is something that is just not allowed under state law. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=55.36s)]
*  So this publisher, Bruce Willingham, he made sure that what he was doing was on the up and up [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=58.04s)]
*  when he left that recorder. He told the Associated Press, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  I talked on two different occasions to our attorneys to make sure I wasn't doing anything illegal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=66.19999999999999s)]
*  But he left the recorder there, its voice activated, and then he went back and collected. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=74.0s)]
*  And when he collected that reporter, he discovered that there was a lot more going on after the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=80.11999999999999s)]
*  close of the county commission meeting, more than just the violation of the Oklahoma Open [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=85.84s)]
*  Meeting Act that he had suspected. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=91.84s)]
*  Here is how the McCurtain Gazette News headlined it on their front page this week. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Quote, county officials discuss killing and burying Gazette reporters. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  There's an audio recording. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=109.64s)]
*  The audio of this conversation was released this weekend by the McCurtain Gazette News, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  and it is horrifying. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=115.72s)]
*  In the audio recording, you can hear the McCurtain County Sheriff talking to another [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=118.88s)]
*  official from the sheriff's office, as well as the local county commissioner. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=124.12s)]
*  And it appears that the officials are sort of bluntly talking amongst themselves about killing [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=127.24s)]
*  the publisher of the local newspaper, Bruce Willingham, and his son, Chris, who also works [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=134.44s)]
*  as a reporter for the McCurtain Gazette News. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=140.56s)]
*  This is apparently due to the fact that the paper has published unfavorable stories about [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=145.0s)]
*  the sheriff's office in the past. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=149.28s)]
*  But regardless of what caused any sort of bad will here, the conversation that follows [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=152.56s)]
*  is disturbing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  So if you don't want to hear it, now's your chance to hit pause or turn me off. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=159.48s)]
*  But here we go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=163.48s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=165.92s)]
*  They're insignificant in my life. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=166.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=170.55999999999997s)]
*  They bring those things. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=171.55999999999997s)]
*  What goes around goes around. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=172.55999999999997s)]
*  It will. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=173.56s)]
*  I told you it will. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=174.56s)]
*  I know where two big deep holes are if you ever need them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=175.56s)]
*  I've got an excavator. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=176.56s)]
*  These are already pre-dug. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=177.56s)]
*  I know where two big deep holes are if you ever need them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=178.56s)]
*  Well, I've got an excavator. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=188.56s)]
*  Well, these are already pre-dug. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  As if what they were saying was not clear enough. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=193.88s)]
*  They also discussed the ins and outs of what it would take to hire a hitman to do the job. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=196.28s)]
*  I've known two or three hitmen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=226.28s)]
*  They're very quiet guys. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=239.4s)]
*  They would cut no bleeping mercy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=240.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=242.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=243.52s)]
*  But if a hair on his wife's head, the reporter's wife's head, was touched, in another part [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=244.8s)]
*  of the recording, a voice identified as the county commissioner laments the fact that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=252.52s)]
*  lynchings are no longer common practice. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=257.68s)]
*  That is no longer something you're allowed to do. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=260.72s)]
*  I heard the other day, I said, two to twelve people going to the sheriff. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=262.72s)]
*  I said, let's get 20. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=267.72s)]
*  They don't have a goddamn clue what they're getting into. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=268.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=269.72s)]
*  But everybody. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=270.72s)]
*  I want to say something. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=271.72s)]
*  If it was back then, when Alan Marsh would take a damn black guy and say, I'm going to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=272.72s)]
*  take a damn black guy and say, I'm going to take a damn black guy and say, I'm going [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=273.72s)]
*  to take a damn black guy and say, I'm going to take a damn black guy and say, I'm going [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=274.72s)]
*  to take a damn black guy and say, I'm going to take a damn black guy and say, I'm going [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=275.72s)]
*  I'll say something. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=277.16s)]
*  If it was back in the day you take a damn black guy and would their ass and throw them [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=278.16s)]
*  in the cell. Now it's not like that anymore. I know. Take them down to Mud Creek and hang [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=300.2s)]
*  them up with a damn rope. But you can't do that anymore. They've got more rights now [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=305.96s)]
*  than we do. They've got more rights now than we got. NBC News has not independently verified [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=309.84s)]
*  this audio. We reached out to the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office this afternoon by [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=318.86s)]
*  phone. They told us they had no comment at this time. We also reached out to the County [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  Commissioner, who apparently has his voice on that tape. We have not heard back from [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=325.8s)]
*  him. But we will tell you that certainly everybody in the state of Oklahoma appears to be taking [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=330.48s)]
*  this matter rather seriously. The publisher of the newspaper says he's turned over these [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=335.58s)]
*  audio recordings to the FBI and to the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office. He says he's also [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=340.24s)]
*  already had several conversations with federal investigators. The governor of the state of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=345.0s)]
*  Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, has called on the officials who are heard in these recordings to resign [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=349.88s)]
*  Again, the governor is calling on these county officials to resign. He's also asking the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=355.56s)]
*  Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation to look into this matter. The state representative for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=361.48s)]
*  the area has also demanded that the sheriff resign and others resign. The local mayor [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=366.56s)]
*  has also demanded these resignations. And look at this. This morning, more than 100 [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  people gathered outside the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office to protest and to demand [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=376.52s)]
*  that these officials leave their post over these racist and violent comments talking [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=381.2s)]
*  about how they wish they could lynch people like you could back in the day. They wish [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  you could whoop people's ass and throw them in the cell. Can't do that anymore. They got [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=390.88s)]
*  more rights than we got now. After a lot of online sleuthing by disinformation researchers, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  particularly Russian disinformation researchers, the Wall Street Journal has just published [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=405.8s)]
*  bizarre report about one of the largest, most widely followed pro Kremlin, pro Russia, pro [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  Putin social media networks on earth. First of all, the amazing thing that they report [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=416.88000000000005s)]
*  is that this network apparently is controlled by an American woman who is reportedly pretending [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=422.88000000000005s)]
*  to be Russian. She is pretending to have been born in eastern Ukraine. She was not born in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=429.12s)]
*  eastern Ukraine. She was born in New Jersey, but she's claiming to be of Russian origin [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=435.84s)]
*  when she is not. She has reportedly been running this major online network supporting Russia in [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=441.44s)]
*  the war in Ukraine with accounts on Telegram and Twitter and YouTube and Spotify. There's even a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=446.64s)]
*  podcast where she apparently speaks in a kind of fake Russian accent. The Wall Street Journal is [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=451.68s)]
*  describing her linked social media accounts as a prominent online voice supporting Russia's war in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=458.24s)]
*  Ukraine, describing it as among the most widely followed English language social media outlets [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=464.0s)]
*  promoting Russia's views. But again, it's all run by an American woman pretending to be a Russian. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=469.68s)]
*  And what the Wall Street Journal is reporting now is amazing on a few different levels. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=477.92s)]
*  You know, the classified documents that were allegedly posted online on that gaming server, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=483.44s)]
*  that discord gaming server by that 21 year old Massachusetts Air National Guardsmen who's now [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=487.84s)]
*  been arrested. Part of the mystery around that story has not just been how did a kid who looks [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=492.64s)]
*  like he's 11 years old get access to documents that secret. Another part of the sort of logistical [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=498.24s)]
*  mystery of it has been the timing of it all because this young man allegedly posted all these [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=504.08s)]
*  documents, classified documents. He posted them online starting in December and January, but they [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=509.2s)]
*  didn't come to public attention until much later, until this month. Well, according to the Wall [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=514.8s)]
*  Street Journal, part of the reason that happened the way it did, part of the reason these documents [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=521.04s)]
*  finally came to public attention after languishing on this gaming discord server where nobody was [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=525.52s)]
*  noticing them is because one particular social media account with a big following, this one [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=531.36s)]
*  social media account with a big following for being pro-Russian and pro-Putin, the one [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  run secretly by this American woman, her telegram account started posting these documents [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  to their own telegram account a couple of weeks ago on April 5th. So the Massachusetts Airmen [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=549.92s)]
*  had been posting them on this discord server. It was this woman apparently, or at least the network [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=555.68s)]
*  she was running that circulated them more broadly by posting them on telegram. She has a large [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=560.4s)]
*  following on telegram by pro-Russia, pro-Putin, pro-Kremlin interests. Big Russian accounts [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=566.48s)]
*  started picking up these documents only after she posted them to telegram, started circulating [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=574.08s)]
*  them more widely. And then that's when the Pentagon finally noticed them and started [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  investigating. In other words, the documents were basically unnoticed sitting there on obscure gaming [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=583.76s)]
*  server chat rooms. They didn't get noticed at all until this big pro-Putin social media account [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=589.76s)]
*  put them into circulation. There's a bunch of things that are very interesting about this. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=595.6s)]
*  I mean, one, this pro-Putin social media network, which played this key role apparently in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=601.84s)]
*  circulating these classified documents, the woman who reportedly runs that network is not only [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=608.0s)]
*  American, even though she claims to be Russian, but until November, according to the Wall Street [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  Journal, she was in the United States Navy stationed at Whidbey Island. That seems like a problem. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=618.1600000000001s)]
*  Another point here, perhaps a bigger problem here, is that there is a Fox News channel problem [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=627.76s)]
*  associated with this. In this whole scandal about these classified documents being posted online, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=632.72s)]
*  you might have heard along the way that some of the documents were altered. So it wasn't just that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=638.72s)]
*  this was all classified material that the public was never supposed to see. Part of the issue here [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=646.24s)]
*  was that some of these documents were altered from what they originally said. Well, according to the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=652.56s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, the changed documents, the doctored documents are the ones that were posted [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  online by this woman or by the network that she was running, this pro-Putin pro-Russia social media [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=664.8s)]
*  network, which put these things into wider circulation. Specifically, what was changed? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=669.92s)]
*  Well, one of these documents was changed to make Russian casualties in the war look way lower than [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=674.64s)]
*  they were and to make Ukrainian casualties look way higher than they were. In other words, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=681.52s)]
*  this one document was doctored to make it look like Russia was doing way better in the war than [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=686.96s)]
*  they actually are and to make it look like Ukraine was losing really badly. Another way to put it is [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=691.2s)]
*  the way they put it when they discussed it on Fox News. The second thing we learned from these [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  slides is that despite direct U.S. involvement, Ukraine is in fact losing the war. Seven Ukrainians [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=705.6s)]
*  are being killed for every Russian. Ukraine is losing the war. Ukraine is losing the war. Seven [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=712.24s)]
*  Ukrainians are being killed for every Russian. That's not actually what you can learn from the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=718.96s)]
*  slides. That's what you can learn from the documents that were allegedly posted online by this [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=725.12s)]
*  Massachusetts Air National Guardsman who was arrested that week. But then in order to get that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=731.84s)]
*  seven Ukrainians killed for every one Russian killed, in order to get that, you can only learn [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=738.08s)]
*  that from the slides that were crudely doctored by the pro-Russia, pro-Putin social media network [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=742.8000000000001s)]
*  that circulated the classified information in the first place, but only reportedly after changing [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  the documents to try to make it look like Russia's war is going way better than it is. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=753.6s)]
*  So how did these documents get into circulation? This weird pro-Russia social media network [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=758.16s)]
*  affiliated with somebody who just got out of the U.S. Navy, that is the network that also circulated [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  the fake documents that were altered crudely to make it look like Russia is definitely winning [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=771.52s)]
*  the war and Ukraine is definitely losing. And that's the document that Fox News highlighted [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=777.28s)]
*  on their network last Thursday night. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  On Thursday this past week, a 16-year-old boy was sent out by his mom to go pick up his two younger [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=789.36s)]
*  brothers. His two younger brothers had been at a friend's house, but this young man, 16-year-old [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=796.48s)]
*  young man, his name is Ralph, he got confused by the address. He accidentally rang the doorbell [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=803.68s)]
*  at the wrong house on a nearby street. One street over, he was going to what he thought was the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=813.2s)]
*  house where his younger twin brothers were staying with a friend. He went by accident to the wrong [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=819.2s)]
*  house on a neighboring street. An 85-year-old white man who lived at that house answered the door and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  according to court documents when the man saw 16-year-old Ralph Yarrow on his doorstep, he shot [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=829.84s)]
*  him twice, shot him once in the head, then opened his door and shot him once in the arm. According [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=836.24s)]
*  to prosecutors, Ralph Yarrow never entered the man's home. He was shot through the glass of the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=840.48s)]
*  front door for the first shot. Miraculously, Ralph Yarrow survived. He got up and he ran away. He [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=846.32s)]
*  reportedly had to go to three different homes before someone agreed to help him. Mr. Yarrow has [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  been in the hospital since Thursday night, but he was discharged this afternoon. He's now at his home [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=859.28s)]
*  recovering. His mom is a nurse and she's been caring for him. Tonight, Monday night, four days [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=863.44s)]
*  after the shooting took place, the county prosecutor announced that the man who shot Ralph Yarrow [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=868.16s)]
*  will be charged in the shooting. He'll be charged with two felony counts, including first degree [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  assault. When the prosecutor announced the charges, he said there was quote a racial component to the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=878.64s)]
*  case. Joining us now is the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Quinton Lucas. Mr. Mayor, thank you so [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=884.56s)]
*  much for being here. I know this is a difficult time for your city. It's good to be with you. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if I explained that in a way which is in keeping with your understanding [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=897.36s)]
*  of these events. Have I got anything wrong or if there's anything important that I left out here? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, I've read the probable cause charging statement and probably just the most heinous part [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=910.08s)]
*  is that the gentleman who shot, I shouldn't say gentleman, just the criminal, the defendant, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=915.52s)]
*  an 85 year old man shot because he claimed he was scared of this black teenager. And I say a [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=921.04s)]
*  black teenage boy, not because of an insult, more because of the fact that this is a kid. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=928.4s)]
*  This is a kid who's sent out by his mother to pick up his younger brothers, the sort of thing that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=934.4s)]
*  should be normal and routine and indeed is. And in our community, tragically last week, it was [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  something they could have taken this boy's life. This young man is accomplished. He's a musician, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=945.52s)]
*  superintendent of North Kansas City schools today. So he's an excellent student, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  maintains a stellar GPA while taking college level courses. Lots of people going on about his [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=957.12s)]
*  talent as a musician, his affiliation with the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra and the marching band. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=964.48s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about his condition and how he and his family are doing? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=971.04s)]
*  I talked to his mother today. She is a strong woman. I could tell during our time just visiting [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=977.5999999999999s)]
*  the last several days, I know have been overwhelming for them. So many people who [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=984.16s)]
*  have reached out, so many people in support, but also a number of questions, questions about why, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=988.48s)]
*  why delay in charges. I know that's a question that's come up. Why and how can something like [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=994.16s)]
*  this happen? And the neighborhood in Kansas City, which is predominantly white, this question [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=998.96s)]
*  that I know many black parents face and black people generally, they move there because of good [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1003.76s)]
*  schools, because of good opportunities. But what do you lose in exchange? Does your child, do you [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1009.12s)]
*  lose your humanity in exchange just from existing while black in certain areas? What we need to work [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1014.96s)]
*  on in Kansas City, and I would say nationwide after this, is how do we make sure that we get, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1021.2s)]
*  first of all, that it's clear that this is not right, that this is not something that's accepted. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1026.24s)]
*  And this fear, this fear of black youth, of black people, you talked about it through the entire show, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1030.8s)]
*  is something that we need to confront, that we need to call out, that we need to address. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1036.88s)]
*  And we need to not have the narrative just be state legislatures that are against diversity training, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1040.4s)]
*  including in my own state. But instead, frankly, people recognizing the bias that lives within so [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1045.2s)]
*  many of them. So we don't see things like this happening again and again. One of the things that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1050.4s)]
*  I've seen discussed in the wake of this shooting is the so-called Stand Your Ground law, which [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1055.76s)]
*  Missouri's had for a number of years now since I believe 2016. Is there any sense in which that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1062.24s)]
*  Stand Your Ground law is implicated here? Obviously, this is a gun crime. This is, in fact, being [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1069.92s)]
*  prosecuted as a crime. This is a shooting that existed, was only able to exist because of the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1077.92s)]
*  gun owner's possession of this weapon. But the way you are allowed to use your weapon is governed [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1083.2s)]
*  in Missouri according to a law that's designed effectively to prevent home invasion. Is something [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1089.2s)]
*  like that going to be implicated here in terms of this young man just having rung the doorbell, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1094.88s)]
*  posing no threat to this family or this home? But nevertheless, those sorts of laws are seen [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  in other places, having muddied the waters around encounters like this that end in shootings. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1105.92s)]
*  We have seen the gun lobby change what is core common sense. I said this earlier, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1113.52s)]
*  but I'll repeat it again. If this is the sort of thing where Stand Your Ground can be enforced, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1118.72s)]
*  then every U.S. postal worker, every Amazon delivery person, every pizza delivery person, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1123.76s)]
*  every Girl Scout volunteer, anybody knock it on your door, now becomes somebody who's subject [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1129.8400000000001s)]
*  to be shot. And I think particularly, and I say this as not just a mayor, not just a person in [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1134.72s)]
*  this community, but as a black man and a black father, to recognize the additional risk that [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1140.24s)]
*  people of color, that black people disproportionately will face because of defenses like this, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1145.52s)]
*  it concerns me greatly. So I do hope that this is a case where there is a conviction. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1152.0s)]
*  But more than that, I hope, and I pray, I don't know if it will happen, but that some of these [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1156.96s)]
*  legislators that have tried to basically allow guns to be everywhere and used in any circumstance [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1161.36s)]
*  and any situation finally say, you know what, this is a kid. This is a good kid who did not [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1166.72s)]
*  deserve this. And what their fetishization of gun laws has done, this expansion of gun rights [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1172.8s)]
*  and protections, so people are using them outside their cars, outside their homes, now standing [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1180.32s)]
*  inside his home, because this guy, I think, was frankly just scared of a black person at his door. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1185.28s)]
*  This needs to be pushed back against, so we actually have responsible common sense laws [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1190.48s)]
*  that aren't threatening the lives of our sons and daughters in our community. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzWdOATEuk&t=1195.36s)]
