# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 9
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys)
*  There was a brief flurry of excitement on the right this afternoon when CBS News was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=0.0s)]
*  first to report that the U.S. Justice Department had started investigating the discovery of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=6.12s)]
*  classified documents found at a think tank called the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=10.76s)]
*  This is effectively where President Biden had his office in Washington after serving [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=16.7s)]
*  as vice president in the Obama administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=21.6s)]
*  He vacated offices there effectively when he declared his run for president in 2020, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=24.84s)]
*  but the Penn-Biden Center is sort of the Biden home in D.C. in terms of his work life out [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=30.88s)]
*  of office. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=36.4s)]
*  Well, on November 2nd, lawyers for President Biden, lawyers who work for him in his personal [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=37.4s)]
*  capacity were reportedly packing up some of the office space that the vice president used [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=42.64s)]
*  at the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=47.32s)]
*  In so doing, they found classified documents there, classified documents that they say [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=49.28s)]
*  were in a locked closet inside those offices mixed in with some non-classified documents. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=54.0s)]
*  This is of course a weird set of circumstances, but that's what they say happened. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=62.16s)]
*  The White House has since confirmed the basics of this account, as have other news organizations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=65.84s)]
*  after CBS News was first to break the story. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=70.1s)]
*  The reason this created a lot of excitement on the right briefly tonight is that it immediately [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=73.92s)]
*  created a perceived whataboutism defense for President Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=78.32s)]
*  President Trump is under federal criminal investigation for apparently deliberately [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=83.76s)]
*  hoarding hundreds of classified documents at his home in Florida, including refusing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  to hand them over after National Archives told them he had to, even after they subpoenaed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=94.36s)]
*  him to get those documents. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  So there was this sort of brief excitement on the right tonight that they thought they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=100.56s)]
*  had a new defense, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=104.04s)]
*  Oh, it's supposedly so bad what Trump did at Mar-a-Lago with all the nuclear documents [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=109.68s)]
*  But look, Joe Biden's just as bad. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=110.68s)]
*  Why aren't they serving search warrants on President Biden the way they did on former [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=112.52s)]
*  President Trump? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=116.61999999999999s)]
*  As I said tonight, a brief flurry of excitement on the right about this prospect when this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=118.84s)]
*  news broke about the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  The reason it was only a brief flurry of excitement is because in President Biden's case, he and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=125.84s)]
*  his lawyers appear to have actually done the right thing when it comes to these classified [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=132.74s)]
*  documents. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=136.84s)]
*  Biden's lawyers say they discovered these documents among his vice presidential papers [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  at his office at the Penn-Biden Center on November 2nd. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=142.12s)]
*  The White House Counsel's Office then notified the National Archives that same day about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=146.32s)]
*  what had been found. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=151.8s)]
*  The National Archives apparently did not even know these documents were missing and had [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=153.0s)]
*  not been seeking their return. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=156.96s)]
*  The Archives took custody of that material the following morning. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  And that appears to be it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=165.28s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland has asked one of the last remaining Trump-appointed [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  U.S. attorneys to review the discovery of these documents at the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  But it does not sound like it's an adversarial process at all. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=177.4s)]
*  The White House says it is cooperating fully with the National Archives and with the Department [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  of Justice on the review. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  And again, this was not as it was in Trump's case, the Archives desperately seeking the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=186.74s)]
*  return of materials that Trump was blowing off and Trump was blowing off those requests [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=192.44s)]
*  and then ultimately blowing off the subpoena to return all those documents. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=197.96s)]
*  These appear to have been documents that were inadvertently held at the Penn-Biden Center [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=201.56s)]
*  discovered by Biden's attorneys. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=205.6s)]
*  They notified the White House, which notified immediately the National Archives, that these [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=208.3s)]
*  documents were in the wrong place. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=212.46s)]
*  The Archives moved immediately to retrieve them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=213.88s)]
*  That appears to be the sum total of it, at least as far as we know. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=216.04s)]
*  But again, the White House says they are cooperating fully with the Archives and with the Justice [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=220.32s)]
*  Department on reviewing the situation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=224.84s)]
*  Again, we will bring you more on this if we learn more about it tonight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  But the brief euphoria on the right that this would somehow, you know, exonerate Trump by [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  what aboutism, it's already turning into a bit of a hangover because of the stark contrast [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=237.1s)]
*  between the actions of the current president and the former guy when it comes to classified [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=242.16s)]
*  material. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=246.4s)]
*  There's another provision in this deal, though, that I think is kind of a sleeper, that I [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=248.32s)]
*  think is worth more notice than it has received so far. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=251.8s)]
*  And that's the provision as part of the new rules package that the Republicans are agreeing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=255.44s)]
*  to, which would create a committee to investigate what they call the weaponization of the federal [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  government. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=265.32s)]
*  This is a committee that's expected to be chaired by Trump Republican Jim Jordan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=266.32s)]
*  And the Republicans claim that this committee would have the power to oversee not just the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=271.6s)]
*  Justice Department and the FBI the way they're usually overseen by Congress. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  They claim this committee, led by Jim Jordan, would have the ability to oversee ongoing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=279.92s)]
*  criminal investigations being conducted by the Justice Department. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  Ongoing criminal investigations, like, say, the ongoing criminal investigations into the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  January 6th attack or the ongoing criminal investigations into former President Donald [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  One member of Congress who says he should be considered for a spot on this committee [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=301.12s)]
*  is Scott Perry, a Trump Republican whose phone was recently seized by the Justice Department [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=304.12s)]
*  as part of their investigation into the January 6th attack. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=310.68s)]
*  This one, as I say, I think is the sleeper. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=314.68s)]
*  If Republicans do go through with this committee to try to create a new system of oversight [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  of the Justice Department that includes their ongoing criminal investigations, I mean, we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=323.84s)]
*  can't expect that the Justice Department wouldn't just roll over and go along with it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=331.28s)]
*  We could expect that the Justice Department would presumably go to court if need be to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  protect their investigations. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  But what would happen then? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=341.32s)]
*  I mean, what would happen if two branches of our government went to war over active [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=343.08s)]
*  criminal investigations into a former president that could potentially put him in prison? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=347.4s)]
*  What if it gets left to the pro-Trump conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court to settle [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=352.23999999999995s)]
*  that conflict? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  As I said, the rules changes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=360.52s)]
*  We'll see how they plan out in terms of which pose the most serious threats to sort of regular [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=361.52s)]
*  order and normal small-D democratic governance. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=366.0s)]
*  But this effort to try to get members of Congress into the criminal justice system in this specific [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=370.28s)]
*  way, that's by my bet really the one to watch. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=384.11999999999995s)]
*  He is the author of among many books, the bestseller On Tyranny, 20 Lessons from the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=387.76s)]
*  20th Century. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=393.28s)]
*  Professor Snyder, it's a real pleasure to see you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=394.28s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=396.28s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=397.28s)]
*  Very glad to be with you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=398.28s)]
*  In terms of how tyranny works and how authoritarianism works, I'm a little bit worried that I'm seeing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=403.84s)]
*  this through two American lens and I'm seeing all of this recent American precedent for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=410.56s)]
*  the sort of thing that we saw in Brazil this weekend. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=416.72s)]
*  Should I be looking at this with a wider and more international lens, that this is the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  sort of thing that authoritarian movements and far-right movements do all the time? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=423.24s)]
*  This shouldn't echo January 6th so much as we should see it as a typical right-wing fascist [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=428.12s)]
*  pro-authoritarian tactic that people use all over the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=434.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think you're right to point to the evident similarities between January 6th and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  January 8th. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  But I think both January 6th and January 8th, as you suggest, are about larger trends too. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=445.23999999999995s)]
*  One of them is to discredit institutions. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=452.08s)]
*  When you storm institutions, when you show you can make yourself physically present in [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  institutions, when you break windows, when you trash the place, what you're showing is [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=459.23999999999995s)]
*  symbolically, physically, that institutions don't matter. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=463.4s)]
*  What matters is force. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  What matters is will. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  That, of course, is one of the oldest, one of the classic anti-democratic or anti-rule-of-law [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  moves. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  You show disrespect for the institutions physically, and then all that seems to be left is the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  possibility that a person, a strongman, something besides these institutions, should be running [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=481.92s)]

*  That's a logic which is on display here in Brazil and in the US, but it's also a classic [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  logic. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=495.48s)]
*  Then likewise, a lie, an alternative reality, a strong belief among lots of people that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=496.48s)]
*  what happened is not what happened, that we didn't really lose the vote, we really won [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=503.20000000000005s)]

*  That's common between January 6th and January 8th, but it's also a big 20th century, 21st [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  century phenomenon, big lies which capture lots of people. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=514.32s)]
*  With the recent twist, and I think this is true about Brazil and the US, that it's social [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=519.28s)]
*  media bubbles which allow this to happen. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=523.0s)]
*  I think there's an odd way in which the people who are storming these buildings are kind [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  of emerging from alternative reality into real reality as they do it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=528.56s)]
*  They're sure they're right because they're not hearing any other voices in the social [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=533.28s)]

*  terms of standing up for democracy, trying to protect democracy against these kinds of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=546.16s)]
*  forces and attacks, how much does it matter that there is swift accountability for the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=549.6s)]
*  people who participate in it and the people who organize it? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=557.6s)]
*  One of the differences between January 8th and Brazil, January 6th in the United States, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=560.64s)]
*  is that we saw a lot of arrests in Brazil and that we've got a sitting president who [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=564.96s)]
*  is the successor to Bolsonaro saying that those who participated in this and those who [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  organized it will be held accountable swiftly and surely. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=574.08s)]
*  What role does accountability in the legal system, the criminal justice system, play in [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=579.84s)]
*  fending this off as a tactic against democracy? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=584.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the comparison is absolutely right and I'm very pleased for the Brazilian [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  government that they were able to react so quickly. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=593.48s)]
*  It's very important that people who try to carry out this kind of fascist move are aware [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=597.1600000000001s)]
*  that the law also has force beside it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=603.9599999999999s)]
*  One of the things they're trying to do is monopolize force themselves. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=607.0799999999999s)]
*  They're trying to say, we are the ones who control violence. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=610.52s)]
*  We intimidate you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=613.0s)]
*  We intimidate the law. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  We're going to do something which is so strange and confusing and violent that you won't know [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  how to react to it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=619.16s)]
*  And there was a bit of that in the US on January 6th. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  It was so strange and unexpected and violent that the people, the criminals just walked [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=622.3599999999999s)]
*  away from the crime scene. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=627.04s)]
*  That's odd. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=629.5999999999999s)]
*  We didn't see that in Brazil today. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=630.68s)]
*  And it's really important. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=632.28s)]
*  It's really important because things like this, they're kind of a test of force. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=633.7199999999999s)]
*  The people who are on the far right, that's what they believe in. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=638.4s)]
*  They believe in force. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=641.2399999999999s)]
*  And if they don't meet any force on the other end, then they're going to continue. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=642.2399999999999s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that the people who are defending law should be unpredictable. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  It means that they should be predictable. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=649.7199999999999s)]
*  It means that they should be confident that something like this is a crime and that the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=651.4s)]
*  pictures like the ones we're seeing, where if you commit a crime, you go and destroy [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  property, you commit all kinds of crimes, that you might just end up on a bus handcuffed, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  that that's normal, that democracies, because the story that fascists always tell is [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  democracies are weak. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=666.52s)]
*  They won't fight back. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=667.92s)]
*  They're flabby. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  They're decadent. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think it's pretty important for democracies to be able to say, no, actually, we stand [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=671.1999999999999s)]
*  for something and that something we stand for is law. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=674.64s)]
*  I think that that point that you just made, too, is very important about how there is [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=678.8s)]
*  a tactical impact to seeming unpredictable, chaotic, weird, strange, and that treating [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=683.16s)]
*  these things as crimes, among other things, and accountability is an important concept. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  But among other things, using the criminal law to respond to things like this has an [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=696.8s)]
*  effect of rationalizing the experience of what the country has just been through, of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=700.48s)]
*  imposing not only order in terms of people being held accountable, but also a framework [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=705.7199999999999s)]
*  of understanding that this is a crime, this is something that exists within our system. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=712.16s)]
*  It does not destroy our system. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=716.5999999999999s)]
*  Our system itself can handle things like this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  I think that's that rationalizing force is an important insight. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=720.6s)]
*  Yeah. And that we're all equal before the law, that we're all equal before the law, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=726.12s)]
*  that any of us does something like this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=730.6400000000001s)]
*  It's very I mean, you were asking directly about Trump. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=732.6s)]
*  It's very important for a democracy not to have these superheroes or supervillains who [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=735.36s)]
*  are judged by different standards. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  It's very important that executives and former executives be subject to the rule of law, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  because once you start developing a legal theory according to which they're exceptional [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=746.04s)]
*  people, that little loophole will just grow bigger and bigger all the time. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=749.28s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, professor of history at Yale University, the author of, among many other [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=754.52s)]
*  books on tyranny, 20 Lessons from the 20th Century, which is mandatory reading that you [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=759.1999999999999s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=770.52s)]
*  However surprised we might have been as a country when that happened in January 2021, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=771.04s)]
*  the American right wing had been showing us for months all over the country that that's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=776.68s)]
*  the way they plan to operate from here on out. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, in 2020, they sent armed mobs out to government sites in in Michigan, in Idaho, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=783.88s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, in Oregon, in Arizona, in Georgia, you name it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=791.52s)]
*  And they sent them into state capitals. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=795.76s)]
*  They sent them to the offices of statewide officials. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=797.48s)]
*  They sent them to the homes of statewide officials. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=799.08s)]
*  Always with guns, always with force. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=802.5200000000001s)]
*  And now, even as the national expression of this tactic in Washington, D.C., January 6, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=808.6s)]
*  2021, even as that has been successfully adjudicated in federal court as an act of sedition and [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=815.24s)]
*  as upwards of a thousand people have been criminally charged for their crimes, the American [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  people have been criminally charged for their participation. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=826.0s)]
*  And again, the national version of this tactic from January 6, 2021. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=828.48s)]
*  Now we are starting to see how this looks when this American right wing tactic gets [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=834.48s)]
*  translated into foreign languages and foreign countries. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=839.72s)]
*  It was only last month when German police arrested more than two dozen people who they [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=843.36s)]
*  say were planning a similar armed right wing attack on the German parliament. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  They were well armed. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=853.1600000000001s)]
*  They were fairly well connected. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=854.12s)]
*  One former member of parliament from a right wing party was among those arrested. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=855.36s)]
*  It was thought that her access to the parliament building as a former member might have [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=859.2s)]
*  been used to get these armed attackers inside the Reichstag on the day of their planned [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=864.48s)]
*  assault. Now, this month, it's Brazil where Trumpy right wing former president Jair [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=868.6800000000001s)]
*  Bolsonaro lost his bid for reelection on the last day of October. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=877.52s)]
*  The time frame is almost exactly the same from when Trump lost reelection in early [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=882.36s)]
*  November 2020 and then his supporters attacked the U.S. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=887.0s)]
*  Capitol the first week of January. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=890.12s)]
*  Bolsonaro lost reelection the last day of October and now his supporters have attacked [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=892.6s)]
*  the national capital the first week of January as well. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=897.8000000000001s)]
*  Bolsonaro, like Trump, said in advance of the presidential election that the election [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=900.84s)]
*  was rigged. The only way he could lose is through fraud. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=905.6s)]
*  Like Trump, Bolsonaro said in advance that he would only accept the elections results [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  if he won. Like Trump, Bolsonaro then lost and like Trump, Bolsonaro then refused to [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=913.3599999999999s)]
*  concede. He also refused to go to his successor's inauguration, just like Trump did. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=919.5999999999999s)]
*  When Bolsonaro supporters attacked their national capital yesterday, it was like watching [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=925.8s)]
*  a Southern Hemisphere, Southern performance, Southern Hemisphere summer performance of [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  the January 6th attack. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=935.8s)]
*  The images and videos coming out of the Brazilian capital were so uncannily similar to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=938.8s)]
*  what we saw here at home. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=943.28s)]
*  And the pro-Bolsonaro mob attacked journalists and stole and smashed journalists' [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=946.12s)]
*  equipment, just as the pro-Trump mob did on January 6th. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=951.8s)]
*  The Bolsonaro mob used police barricades as battering rams. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  They attacked police officers in bloody hand-to-hand combat. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=960.52s)]
*  They ransacked the offices of members of the Brazilian government. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=963.96s)]
*  They took selfies and posed in government chambers. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=969.2s)]
*  Just like Trump did, Bolsonaro waited silently for hours as the attack was underway. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=974.4s)]
*  He only put out a statement calling for peace once the security forces had regained control [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=979.36s)]
*  of the capital and repelled the invasion. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=983.96s)]
*  Bolsonaro's family and supporters, just like Trump's, soon started claiming that it wasn't [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=986.44s)]
*  them at all who attacked the capital. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=991.52s)]
*  It was bad guys. It was left wingers. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=993.28s)]
*  It was Antifa criminals dressed up like Bolsonaro's supporters. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=995.24s)]
*  It wasn't really Bolsonaro supporters who did all of this ransacking and who trashed the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=999.72s)]
*  capital. The parallels are so tight, it's almost stupid. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1005.04s)]
*  It almost just seems like reading the same script in a different language. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1009.6s)]
*  And seeing English language hashtags trending online about the attack, seeing English language [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1015.7199999999999s)]
*  signs at the attack in a country where they speak Portuguese, not English. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1025.56s)]
*  I mean, it tells you something about how this may be more than just inspired by what happened [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1029.84s)]
*  here in our own right-wing attempt at a violent government overthrow. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1035.36s)]
*  But there's also some important differences. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1041.32s)]
*  Like, for example, in Brazil, they actually arrested people on the day of the attack. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1043.48s)]
*  More than a thousand people arrested yesterday, unlike our own capital attack on January 6th, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1048.44s)]
*  in which almost no one was arrested until well after it was all over and most of the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1053.72s)]
*  attackers had gone home. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1057.72s)]
*  In Brazil's case, they've got more than a thousand people in custody today from yesterday's [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1059.4s)]
*  attack. Also in Brazil's case, they launched this attack a week after the transfer of power [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1063.64s)]
*  had already happened, not before the transfer of power like happened with the Trump supporters [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1069.08s)]
*  in D.C. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1073.6399999999999s)]
*  Because the new president of Brazil has already been sworn in and Bolsonaro is already an [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1076.1999999999998s)]
*  ex-president, that has all sorts of implications for the former president Bolsonaro and whether [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1080.52s)]
*  he's going to be held responsible for what his followers just did. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1085.8799999999999s)]
*  Bolsonaro bizarrely is in Florida right now. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1089.56s)]
*  Since the day that he left office, he has been staying at a weird little suburban [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1093.48s)]
*  McMansion near Disney World, which he rented from a mixed martial arts fighter. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1098.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1103.48s)]
*  The State Department spent today fending off requests from reporters about what exactly [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1104.76s)]
*  Bolsonaro is doing here. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1109.24s)]
*  Is he here to try to avoid prosecution on the numerous corruption probes and other forms [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1111.32s)]
*  of criminal investigations that he's facing in Brazil? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1116.84s)]
*  The State Department is fending off questions today about, you know, what kind of visa [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1120.6s)]
*  Bolsonaro is on and what's going to happen if in fact he faces charges at home. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1124.04s)]
*  And Brazil asked the United States to extradite him to face trial there. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1127.72s)]
*  We're also tonight learning that even more weirdly, the official in the Brazilian government, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1132.92s)]
*  who is the security chief specifically responsible for security in Brasilia, in their national [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1139.88s)]
*  capital, he was also in Florida at the time the attack on the capital happened this weekend. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1145.96s)]
*  He has since been fired from the Brazilian government as of today. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1154.1200000000001s)]
*  What was he doing in Florida when the attack took place? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1158.68s)]
*  Why is he still there now? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1161.16s)]
*  We have a lot of challenges. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  But on top of it all, we now need to content with the fact that at least Florida appears [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1166.76s)]
*  to be developing as a refuge for would-be dictators for whom the violent efforts of [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1170.68s)]
*  their supporters were not quite enough to keep them in power. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1175.32s)]
*  Florida is apparently lousy with that kind of overripe fruit right now. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1179.16s)]
*  And we need to contend with the fact that whether or not the world [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1182.76s)]
*  still sees us as a beacon of democracy, a city on the hill, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1186.52s)]
*  the far right around the world apparently now sees our far right [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1191.0800000000002s)]
*  as a model for violent mass attack against the institutions of government. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1194.92s)]
*  As Americans, we take great pride in leading the world in lots of things. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1201.64s)]
*  We do not take great pride in this. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o98BeUk10Ys&t=1204.8400000000001s)]
