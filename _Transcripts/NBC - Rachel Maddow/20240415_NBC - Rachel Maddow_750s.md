# The real DOJ corruption scandal at the heart of Trump's criminal trial in New York
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk)
*  Justice Department rules do say, for better or for worse, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=0.0s)]
*  that presidents can't be criminally charged [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=4.0s)]
*  while they are serving as president. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=6.44s)]
*  But if federal prosecutors had determined [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=8.84s)]
*  that Trump had committed these crimes with Michael Cohen, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=11.34s)]
*  right, nothing would stop them from charging Trump [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=15.68s)]
*  for those crimes the moment he was once again [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  a private citizen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=20.38s)]
*  And the head of the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=22.12s)]
*  that did this investigation, that brought this case, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  he says that Trump's guys at the U.S. Justice Department [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=27.28s)]
*  monkeyed with this case. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  They monkeyed with this investigation on Trump's behalf [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  to make sure SDNY would never and could never determine [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=36.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump committed these federal crimes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=39.46s)]
*  This isn't something that like, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=44.86s)]
*  we had to worry might happen, this happened. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=45.94s)]
*  And the whistleblower on this was the guy [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=48.84s)]
*  who was running the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=50.74s)]
*  that got monkeyed with. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=53.24s)]
*  He was in a position to know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  Another revelation from Jeff Berman's book [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=58.78s)]
*  was that when Michael Cohen pled guilty, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  Trump's Justice Department made prosecutors at SDNY [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=62.88s)]
*  strip out tons of references to Trump [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  in their court filings. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=68.68s)]
*  And so yeah, the big damning document they ultimately filed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=70.42s)]
*  contained that key phrase that Cohen acted [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=73.92s)]
*  in coordination with and at the direction of individual one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=76.92s)]
*  But Jeff Berman says that the document [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=80.66s)]
*  his office had planned to file was much more explicit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  about Trump's involvement in Cohen's crimes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=86.22s)]
*  What they'd wanted to say was that Trump acted [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=91.16s)]
*  in concert with and coordinated with Cohen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=93.1s)]
*  Apparently when Trump's Justice Department saw that, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=95.44s)]
*  they were livid, they made SDNY cut down this court filing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=97.44s)]
*  from 40 pages to 21 pages, and they made them strip out [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=101.14s)]
*  all the most damning findings about Trump [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=105.34s)]
*  in order to protect Trump from this federal investigation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=108.92s)]
*  When they got done with it, the final document [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=113.32s)]
*  no longer said that Michael Cohen had committed his crime [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=115.94s)]
*  acting in concert with and coordinating with Trump, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=118.08s)]
*  with individual one. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=121.52s)]
*  Instead, the final document said Michael Cohen acted [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=123.08s)]
*  in concert with and coordinated with one or more members [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  of the Trump campaign. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=130.76s)]
*  One or more members of the Trump campaign was Trump. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=133.2s)]
*  But Justice Department officials in Washington, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=138.44s)]
*  people appointed by Trump, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=141.1s)]
*  made the prosecutor's office take that out. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=143.62s)]
*  Jeff Berman also says he was ordered [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=150.04s)]
*  by Trump's Justice Department to investigate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=151.64s)]
*  prominent Democrats at Trump's behest, including John Kerry. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=153.68s)]
*  Berman says he was told right before the 2018 [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=159.48s)]
*  midterm elections that his office should bring charges [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=161.78s)]
*  against a Democratic lawyer who had been [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=164.36s)]
*  President Obama's White House counsel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=166.62s)]
*  Berman's office looked into it, decided not only had [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=168.72s)]
*  Obama's White House counsel not done anything [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=171.26s)]
*  to warrant being prosecuted, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=174.2s)]
*  he actually hadn't done anything at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  He was innocent of what he was being accused of here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=179.06s)]
*  After Berman refused to bring those charges, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=182.1s)]
*  Trump's Attorney General Bill Barr [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=184.7s)]
*  then tried to push Berman into resigning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=186.5s)]
*  He even put out a late night press release in June 2020, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=189.94s)]
*  claiming that Jeff Berman had resigned just because [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=194.22s)]
*  Jeff Berman had not resigned. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=198.66000000000003s)]
*  And he said so. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  He refused to go. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  And he did that in part because he had just seen [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  what had happened in another important US Attorney's office [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=208.9s)]
*  after a total takeover there by Trump's Justice Department. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=211.84s)]
*  It was in the DC US Attorney's office [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=215.12s)]
*  that these schemes went even further. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=217.18s)]
*  Barr in the DC US Attorney's office had succeeded [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=219.36s)]
*  in ousting the US Attorney there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=222.78s)]
*  and instead installing his own people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=224.3s)]
*  That US Attorney's office in DC [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=226.22000000000003s)]
*  then immediately moved to drop the charges [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=228.1s)]
*  and undo the guilty plea [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=230.9s)]
*  from Trump National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=232.7s)]
*  They moved to undo the recommended sentence [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=235.34s)]
*  for Trump advisor, Roger Stone, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=237.66s)]
*  who had just been convicted on multiple felonies. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  This was the same US Attorney's office [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=243.12s)]
*  that also folded to the pressure [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=244.74s)]
*  to bring charges against Obama's White House counsel [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=247.74s)]
*  after Berman refused to do it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=250.54s)]
*  because there was no case there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=252.1s)]
*  Jeffrey Berman saw what had happened [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=253.6s)]
*  in the DC US Attorney's office [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=255.4s)]
*  and he did not want to allow the same thing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=257.34s)]
*  to happen in SDNY. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  And so Jeffrey Berman fought. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=260.82s)]
*  Barr puts out this press release saying Berman has resigned. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=264.06s)]
*  Berman puts out a statement saying, oh no, I haven't. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  And there was this dramatic 48 hours [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=269.94s)]
*  in which Berman twice refused to quit, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=272.06s)]
*  refused to let his office be taken over [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=274.46s)]
*  by Trump's Attorney General. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=276.58s)]
*  And then finally Trump fired Jeffrey Berman. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=279.17999999999995s)]
*  And the victory Berman won in fighting so hard [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  and making so much noise is that after he was fired, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=285.94s)]
*  he made sure that his deputy, a normal prosecutor, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=289.58s)]
*  was promoted to take his place [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=293.46s)]
*  instead of Bill Barr just sending Trump guys [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=295.06s)]
*  to take it over like he did in DC. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=296.9s)]
*  But this is a very bad black mark [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=300.48s)]
*  on the record of the US Justice Department. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=303.38s)]
*  And the result of all of this was terrible drama, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=306.78s)]
*  scary revelations about the Justice Department [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=310.58s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  But it was also crucially [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=314.42s)]
*  a federal criminal investigation [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=317.22s)]
*  diverted and delayed and tampered with. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=319.1s)]
*  The federal criminal investigation into the crimes [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  for which Michael Cohen went to prison was stymied. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  And here's a key point. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=327.82s)]
*  It wasn't just the federal criminal investigation [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=329.22s)]
*  because while all this was going on at the federal level, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=332.1s)]
*  the investigation into Michael Cohen, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=335.62s)]
*  the attempted investigation of people beyond Cohen [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  who participated in those same crimes, Trump, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=339.82s)]
*  the revelation of Trump's personal culpability [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=342.82s)]
*  for these crimes, Trump's Justice Department, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=345.3s)]
*  while all this was happening, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=347.7s)]
*  they reached down and put the brakes on the whole thing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=349.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=354.34s)]
*  A corrupted federal Justice Department [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=355.18s)]
*  acting to protect the president [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=358.54s)]
*  despite findings of law and fact. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=360.58s)]
*  While that was happening at the federal level [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=364.5s)]
*  around the Cohen case, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=366.58s)]
*  it had the effect of stymying [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=368.52s)]
*  a potential state prosecution as well. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=370.42s)]
*  Because New York prosecutors [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=373.06s)]
*  and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=374.38s)]
*  were also interested in investigating [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=375.86s)]
*  and potentially prosecuting these crimes [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=377.78s)]
*  that had taken place. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=379.9s)]
*  After all, these crimes took place in their city. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=380.78s)]
*  But the feds, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=383.42s)]
*  This was supposedly their case [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=386.1s)]
*  and they asked state prosecutors to hold off [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=387.78s)]
*  while they pursued their federal case in this matter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=390.14s)]
*  What we came to learn though [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=393.3s)]
*  is that the federal case wasn't happening. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=394.82s)]
*  It was delayed and diverted and perverted [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=397.1s)]
*  and ultimately stopped by Trump's appointees [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=399.78s)]
*  at the US Justice Department. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=403.38s)]
*  And so state prosecutors are twiddling their thumbs, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=406.26s)]
*  wasting tons of times waiting around for the feds [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=408.82s)]
*  to supposedly finish this investigation, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=411.38s)]
*  which is an investigation that's not actually happening [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=413.82s)]
*  because of corruption. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=417.9s)]
*  It was months after Cohen's guilty plea [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=422.05999999999995s)]
*  that federal prosecutors quietly signaled [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=425.05999999999995s)]
*  in a court filing that the investigation was over [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=427.3s)]
*  and nobody besides Michael Cohen [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=429.82s)]
*  would be federally charged. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=432.06s)]
*  It was literally two weeks later, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=433.58s)]
*  two weeks after that quiet admission from the feds [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=435.86s)]
*  that state prosecutors started issuing subpoenas [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=438.34s)]
*  for their own investigation. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  So if you find yourself wondering why alleged crimes [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=444.58s)]
*  that happened in 2016 are only coming to trial now, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=447.74s)]
*  well, one of the reasons [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=451.53999999999996s)]
*  is that Donald Trump's Justice Department succeeded [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  in delaying and ultimately stymying [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=454.94s)]
*  the federal investigation into the alleged crimes [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=456.86s)]
*  for which Donald Trump is now effectively facing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=458.98s)]
*  a New York State trial. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=461.22s)]
*  And in fact, that successful effort [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=462.54s)]
*  by Trump's Justice Department [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=464.14s)]
*  to forestall any federal investigation into Trump [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  or any charges against him, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=468.26s)]
*  we can see the legacy of that successful corruption, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=470.82s)]
*  that successful corruption of the case. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=476.02000000000004s)]
*  We can see the legacy of it [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  in the way the Manhattan District Attorney [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=479.98s)]
*  has had to charge this case [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=482.02000000000004s)]
*  because one of the big awkward parts of this case [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  that's now being tried in New York [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=485.98s)]
*  is that there's a crime that's being described here [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=488.86s)]
*  that's never actually been charged. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=491.78000000000003s)]
*  Right, people who criticize this case, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=495.5s)]
*  that is often one of the major issues they will take of it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=497.74s)]
*  A crime is being described here, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=500.58000000000004s)]
*  but if that crime is such a crime, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=502.14000000000004s)]
*  how come it was never charged? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  Right, the New York DA's case against Donald Trump says, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=506.14000000000004s)]
*  these false business records Trump created [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=510.70000000000005s)]
*  in his real estate business, right, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=513.0600000000001s)]
*  when he disguised these hush money reimbursements [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=514.5s)]
*  to Michael Cohen as if they were legal fees. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=517.06s)]
*  These falsified business records aren't just a misdemeanor, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=519.18s)]
*  they're a felony [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=523.74s)]
*  because they were created to conceal another crime. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=525.86s)]
*  What's the other crime? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=528.78s)]
*  Well, the DA has described [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=531.02s)]
*  what he believes the other crimes are. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=533.62s)]
*  One of the implicated other crimes [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=536.18s)]
*  is the federal campaign finance violation [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=538.14s)]
*  that prosecutors say Michael Cohen [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=540.38s)]
*  committed with Donald Trump. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=542.78s)]
*  It is an awkwardness for this case [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=545.5s)]
*  that that federal crime was never charged [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=547.3s)]
*  against Donald Trump. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  It was only ever charged against Michael Cohen, right? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=550.5s)]
*  But the reason that federal crime [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=555.14s)]
*  was never charged against Trump, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=556.98s)]
*  well, it appears to be because the federal investigation [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=558.42s)]
*  into Trump's culpability in this matter [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=563.14s)]
*  was perverted on Trump's behalf by Trump's appointees. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=565.9s)]
*  So that is kind of this big gaping wound [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=570.62s)]
*  sitting right at the center of this trial. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=573.5s)]
*  It is a constant reminder that it is bulkers [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=574.9s)]
*  that only Michael Cohen and nobody else [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=577.6999999999999s)]
*  ever paid a price for this criminal scheme, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  It is also a constant reminder, you know, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=583.6999999999999s)]
*  of something else and something bigger than this case. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=586.5s)]
*  It is a big, bright, flashing warning light [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=589.9s)]
*  about what we as a country should expect [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=592.02s)]
*  in a second Trump presidency. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=594.22s)]
*  You know how scary it is to think about [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=595.9399999999999s)]
*  Bill Barr doing this with ongoing investigations reportedly [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=598.06s)]
*  with cases that have already been pled to, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=601.3s)]
*  with sentences that have already been recommended [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=604.18s)]
*  by the Justice Department after conviction [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  for him to go in there and get in there [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=608.5s)]
*  and just take apart all of those cases [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  on Trump's behalf because Trump told him to? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=611.9s)]
*  They were able to do some of that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=617.42s)]
*  They would very much like to do a lot more of that, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=619.3s)]
*  which could upend any citizen's life. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=623.42s)]
*  Which could upend any citizen's life in this country [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=626.26s)]
*  at the whim of Donald Trump, right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=629.54s)]
*  We do not talk nearly enough about what Trump succeeded [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=632.26s)]
*  in doing to the US Justice Department when he was president. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  He ousted US attorneys. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=638.22s)]
*  He got investigations into himself and his allies, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=639.74s)]
*  kiboshed, he got the case against [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=642.24s)]
*  his disgraced national security advisor thrown out, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=644.0600000000001s)]
*  even though he had already pled guilty. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=646.78s)]
*  He got the sentencing recommendation for Roger Stone, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=648.86s)]
*  reduced after Stone's multiple convictions. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=651.5s)]
*  He got the Justice Department to investigate [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=654.1s)]
*  and even prosecute prominent Democrats he didn't like [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=656.1s)]
*  even when there was zero case to be made. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=658.98s)]
*  That all is worse than anything Richard Nixon ever did. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=661.22s)]
*  And he was pretty bad on that front. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=665.38s)]
*  It is arguably the worst thing any modern president [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=667.38s)]
*  has ever done to the US Justice Department, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=669.9s)]
*  to the rule of law in this country. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  It is the kind of scandal we should be keeping [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=673.46s)]
*  front of mind every single day [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=675.46s)]
*  as he tries to get back in the White House right now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=677.38s)]
*  It is absolutely the blueprint for where they would start [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=679.78s)]
*  to try to complete the unfinished business, right, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=683.62s)]
*  of the first term if Donald Trump returns to the White House. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=687.3s)]
*  That is where this case comes from, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=691.38s)]
*  The tawdriest case imaginable coming from [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=694.4599999999999s)]
*  the grossest and pettiest personal failings, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=697.74s)]
*  all the while revealing a huge serious problem [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=701.8199999999999s)]
*  for this country that we have not yet reckoned with, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=705.06s)]
*  a core problem for our protection of the rule of law. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=707.62s)]
*  A core failing of the rule of law [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  for which not nearly enough people have yet gotten in trouble. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=715.78s)]
*  or the cloud icon and enjoy it. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNd5Gu-BUkk&t=742.66s)]
