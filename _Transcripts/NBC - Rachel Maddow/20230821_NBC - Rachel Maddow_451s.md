# The dog that didn't bark: Trump's calls for massive protests go unanswered
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0)
*  Turns out the former leader does not snap his fingers and command a nationwide crippling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=0.0s)]
*  uprising in his or her name. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=6.54s)]
*  I mean, even in our country, where he promised he would, where he promised that would happen, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=8.44s)]
*  where he overtly publicly tried to make it happen, it failed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=12.92s)]
*  He failed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=17.36s)]
*  He wanted that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=18.64s)]
*  He promised it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=19.64s)]
*  He was counting on it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=20.64s)]
*  And therefore, a lot of the country was counting on that being a consequence of this part of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=21.64s)]
*  the process. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=25.68s)]
*  It hasn't happened. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=26.72s)]
*  The dog did not bark. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=27.72s)]
*  And so that does sort of settle one big part of this, this existential question for us [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=29.48s)]
*  at this crime scene. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=40.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=41.4s)]
*  This, this existential question for our country and our democracy, for our form of government, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=42.4s)]
*  will we be able to survive bringing criminal charges against this particular alleged criminal, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  given his political power and his hold on his followers? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=51.04s)]
*  Will we be able to try a man for his alleged crimes without riots in the streets, without [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  the threat of civil war? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  It turns out yes, yes we can. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=63.54s)]
*  Despite what he threatened to do, despite what he promised to do, he tried to do it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=67.9s)]
*  He could not pull it off, which is good news for our democracy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=72.18s)]
*  The bad news is that instead we're getting something else. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=77.6s)]
*  Not mass violence again, like we saw on January 6th, not even mass protest. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=83.36s)]
*  But instead what we are getting is individual acts, both violence and threats of violence, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  by radicalized people and groups that support him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=98.1s)]
*  We saw it last year when a man who was enraged by the Mar-a-Lago search warrant shot his [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=102.14s)]
*  way into an Ohio FBI office and was then killed in a shootout outside Cincinnati. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=107.7s)]
*  We saw it a week and a half ago when another armed man was shot and killed by the FBI, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=113.08s)]
*  this time in Utah, when they served a search warrant and arrest warrant on him in response [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=117.7s)]
*  to his threats to kill President Biden and also New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg, who [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=122.56s)]
*  had brought the first indictment against Donald Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=127.28s)]
*  Then last week, a Massachusetts man pled guilty in federal court that after the election, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  he sent bomb threats, death threats to this Arizona official, to Katie Hobbs, who was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=137.8s)]
*  then the Democratic Secretary of State in Arizona and who is now the Democratic governor [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=143.36s)]
*  of Arizona. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=147.4s)]
*  That man pled guilty in federal court last week. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=148.74s)]
*  He will be facing five years in prison when he is sentenced this fall. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=151.32s)]
*  Then it was Alvin Texas last week, a woman arrested for phoning in a death threat to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=155.56s)]
*  the chambers of the federal judge who is overseeing the other federal case against Trump in federal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=161.44s)]
*  district court in Washington. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=166.12s)]
*  The woman admitted threatening to kill the judge and then also volunteered another death [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=168.12s)]
*  threat to federal agents saying she would also kill Texas Democratic Congresswoman Sheila [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=172.94s)]
*  Jackson Lee. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  She reportedly told agents she did not intend to go to Washington, D.C. to carry out her [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=178.68s)]
*  death threat against the judge, although she did make the threat. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=183.52s)]
*  But she told them she absolutely would kill Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee when Sheila [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  Jackson Lee came home to Texas. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  Then it was a weird, attenuated story, sort of announcement out of Reno, Nevada on Friday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  Hazmat teams and robots called in to respond to a cup of white powder and a threatening [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=201.38s)]
*  sign left outside the Reno, Nevada, FBI office. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  And of course, it's all the news from Fulton County, Georgia, where pro-Trump online message [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=212.58s)]
*  boards started immediately after his indictment there, circulating names and purported addresses [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=218.28s)]
*  and phone numbers and photos of the grand jurors who handed down the Trump indictment [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=223.96s)]
*  in Georgia, prompting the Fulton County Sheriff's Office to announce that it was investigating [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  threats made to the grand jurors. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  That soon gave way to the news that the FBI would be joining the Sheriff's Department [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=236.46s)]
*  in an investigation of those threats to the grand jurors. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=240.58s)]
*  Soon gave way to news that the sheriff himself was being threatened and that that was now [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=243.66s)]
*  under investigation, which soon gave news to soon gave way to news that security had [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=248.02s)]
*  also had to be increased around prosecutor Fannie Willis and her office because of threats [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=253.26s)]
*  to her. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=257.8s)]
*  Now, tonight, CNN reporting that employees of the Fulton County Sheriff's Office are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=258.8s)]
*  themselves being threatened, including their homes and their families being threatened [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=263.22s)]
*  by Trump supporters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=267.74s)]
*  Tonight, they've announced a total lockdown on the streets around the Fulton County jail [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=269.8s)]
*  for when former President Trump turns up there this week to surrender himself and get booked, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=275.56s)]
*  which he says will happen on Thursday. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=280.04s)]
*  But honestly, at this point, do we really expect big street protests on behalf of Trump? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=285.16s)]
*  I think we don't. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=292.36s)]
*  I think we don't expect that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=294.2s)]
*  I think that dog has not barked. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=295.46s)]
*  We don't expect big street protests on his behalf. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=299.94s)]
*  We expect terrorism or at least terroristic threats like the ones that have been breaking [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=304.56s)]
*  out all over the country now, like heat rash. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=310.7s)]
*  So what do we do with that as a country? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=316.46s)]
*  I mean, it's a wild context in which to be pursuing politics, but we are and we must. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=318.14s)]
*  The first Republican presidential debate is day after tomorrow. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  It's on Wednesday. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=328.64s)]
*  Trump is arguing that he is such a prohibitive favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=329.96s)]
*  He should not bother with debating. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=335.0s)]
*  And maybe that's true. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=338.0s)]
*  The NBC Des Moines Register MediaCom poll that's out today puts Trump up 23 points over [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=339.88s)]
*  his nearest rival in the key early state of Iowa. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=345.23999999999995s)]
*  That's basically unchanged from the 24 points he was up in Iowa in the last big poll there, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=348.76s)]
*  which was last month. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=353.26s)]
*  But at the same time, in that Iowa poll that's out today, the number of likely Republican [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=356.1s)]
*  caucus goers in Iowa who say that Trump has committed serious crimes is over 25 percent. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=360.98s)]
*  The number of likely Republican caucus goers who say they have an unfavorable view of him [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=367.02s)]
*  is one in three. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=371.82s)]
*  It's 33 percent. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  And when it comes to the question of whether or not Trump should be leading the Republican [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  party, look at this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  Well over 50 percent of likely Republican caucus goers in Iowa say either that Trump [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=383.06s)]
*  was a good president, but it's time to consider new leaders, or that the party just needs [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=388.56s)]
*  a new leader, one with better personal behavior and a different approach. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=393.92s)]
*  You put that together, that's 57 percent of people who are planning on going to the Iowa [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=397.56s)]
*  Republican caucuses, 57 percent who say they want someone other than Trump to be leading [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=402.36s)]
*  their party. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=408.2s)]
*  57 percent don't want him leading their party, while no other candidate gets within 20 percent [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=410.82s)]
*  of him in the same poll. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  What are Republicans doing here? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=418.26s)]
*  How do you feel about this guy? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=422.34000000000003s)]
*  What do you plan on doing about it? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TovgP-I1X0&t=423.76s)]
