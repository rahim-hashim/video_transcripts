# Trump scrambles to buy time with immunity appeal to Supreme Court
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE)
*  A three-judge panel of the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C., released a unanimous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=0.0s)]
*  opinion last week saying that Donald Trump is not immune from criminal prosecution for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  his attempt to stay in power after he lost reelection. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=9.4s)]
*  And when they issued that ruling, they also tried to box him in to what he could do next. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=13.18s)]
*  They tried to box him into appealing straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=17.6s)]
*  They said, the way they ruled, they said that if Trump tried to come back to that same appeals [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  court, if he tried to make that same court take another turn with that same case, Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=25.76s)]
*  would risk the whole process speeding up, which is the last thing he wants. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  They said if he came back to the appeals court instead of just going straight to the Supremes, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=36.44s)]
*  his trial on this issue would effectively be unfrozen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  It would get put back on the calendar. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=44.2s)]
*  All systems go. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=45.92s)]
*  He might end up in court sooner than he wants to. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=46.96s)]
*  Well, today, Donald Trump did go to the Supreme Court, but he asked them to overrule that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=50.64s)]
*  part of the appeals court ruling where they were trying to get him to speed up the process. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=57.64s)]
*  He's asking the Supreme Court to allow him additional review from that same appeals court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=63.04s)]
*  He wants to be able to go to all 11 judges on that D.C. appeals court instead of just [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=68.52s)]
*  the three-judge panel that gave him the ruling thus far. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=73.72s)]
*  And he wants to be able to do that before he appeals to the Supreme Court without risking [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=76.72s)]
*  his trial starting up as punishment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=81.14s)]
*  He argued in his filing with the court tonight that this court should stay this unprecedented [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=84.22s)]
*  and unacceptable departure from ordinary appellate procedures and allow President Trump's claim [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=90.52s)]
*  of immunity to be decided in the ordinary course of justice. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=95.88s)]
*  This presumably, this filing tonight from Trump and his lawyers seems to be their way [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=101.12s)]
*  of trying kind of a bank shot. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=106.12s)]
*  They're insisting that he should get yet more review in the appeals court in D.C. before [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=107.72s)]
*  he inevitably appeals to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=112.68s)]
*  He's always playing for more delay, always playing for more procedure, always playing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=116.48s)]
*  for more time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=120.92s)]
*  Well, how strong is this play? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=122.4s)]
*  How strong is his case for this? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=124.48s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court does grant him what he's asking, what would that mean for the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=126.88s)]
*  timing of his big federal criminal trial for trying to stay in office after he was voted [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  out? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=134.68s)]
*  Joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg, former U.S. attorney, senior FBI official. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=135.68s)]
*  Chuck, it's great to see you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=139.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=140.72s)]
*  My pleasure, Rachel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Did I explain the basics of that correctly, that he is trying to effectively get the Supreme [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=144.6s)]
*  Court to take away that rushing tactic, that tactic by which the appeals court was trying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=149.96s)]
*  to tell him you got to end this appeals process at some point and get to trial? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=156.16s)]
*  Yes, good description. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=161.28s)]
*  I mean, think of it conceptually this way. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=162.44s)]
*  Three-step ladder. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=165.04s)]
*  You know, step one would be the trial court. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=166.04s)]
*  That's where the prosecutors want to be. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=168.36s)]
*  That's where a jury would be seated. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=169.8s)]
*  The trial would be conducted and the verdict rendered. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=172.12s)]
*  Prosecutors want to be there, and Mr. Trump does not. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=174.84s)]
*  Step two on that ladder would be the appellate court, where he recently lost unanimously [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=178.32s)]
*  on his claim of absolute immunity. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=182.6s)]
*  And what he'd like to do now is either be on wrong number three, step three, the Supreme [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  Court, or back in the appellate court. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=189.82s)]
*  But by all means, Rachel, to avoid step one, the trial court. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txHFqenahE&t=192.16s)]
