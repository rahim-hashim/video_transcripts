# When Ukraine Needed U.S. Backing, All They Got Was Donald Trump's Corruption
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E)
*  All right, here's something to understand about the unlikely rise of Volodymyr Zelensky, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=0.0s)]
*  the comedian and actor who became Ukraine's president in 2019. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=4.64s)]
*  Zelensky ran a populist campaign against years and years of political corruption in Ukraine's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=8.5s)]
*  government. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=14.72s)]
*  The Ukrainian people had launched two revolutions in the space of a decade, trying to get themselves [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=15.72s)]
*  a leader who would not be corrupt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=19.54s)]
*  In 2014, they succeeded in ousting a pro-Russian autocrat after he suddenly abandoned a plan [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=21.96s)]
*  to sign a free trade agreement with the European Union and instead opted for closer ties with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=34.12s)]
*  Now, if there's one thing the Ukrainian people had been pretty clear about in recent years [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=35.12s)]
*  is that they wanted greater integration into the West, not with Russia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine has been trying to get into the European Union and into NATO for years, but has constantly [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=43.04s)]
*  been told they weren't ready. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=47.32s)]
*  They had to crack down on corruption and strengthen the rule of law and democratic institutions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=48.96s)]
*  These were, in fact, all real problems in Ukraine. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=54.04s)]
*  They were prerequisites for greater formal integration with Western Europe. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=57.44s)]
*  Essentially, Ukraine had to get its act together. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Only then could they join their neighbors, like Poland and the Baltic states, in orienting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=64.28s)]
*  themselves westward and away from Russia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=68.64s)]
*  The election of this young, charismatic populist leader, elevated to office on the promise [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  of finally getting Ukraine's act together, felt like a real opportunity. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=75.92s)]
*  Now, of course, Vladimir Putin didn't much like this idea. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=81.28s)]
*  He didn't want to see Ukraine get its act together. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=84.6s)]
*  Putin preferred that Ukrainians' experience with democracy had been riddled with corruption [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=87.28s)]
*  and disappointment. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=91.84s)]
*  Plus, he saw this new Ukrainian leader as inexperienced, in way over his head. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=92.84s)]
*  The guy used to be a comedian, for God's sake. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=98.4s)]
*  A perfect opportunity to squeeze Ukraine for new concessions, like ceding Crimea and eastern [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  territories to Russia and swearing off alliances with the West. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=106.38s)]
*  This was a moment when what Ukraine really needed was its biggest, strongest partner, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=111.2s)]
*  the United States, to step up and say that Ukraine and its new president had the full [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=116.96s)]
*  backing and respect and support of the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=121.32s)]
*  That the U.S. stood with Ukraine and with Zelensky against any Russian aggression. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  But that's not what Ukraine's new president got. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=130.24s)]
*  Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, got Donald Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=134.6s)]
*  Trump refused to invite Zelensky to the White House for a show of solidarity that the new [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=139.2s)]
*  Ukrainian leader so desperately wanted. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=142.84s)]
*  Trump and his allies instead pushed a conspiracy theory, actually a bit of Russian disinformation, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=146.08s)]
*  that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Not Russia, remember that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani led an effort to manufacture dirt in Ukraine on Trump's political opponents. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=157.28s)]
*  When the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was perceived as a roadblock [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=164.3s)]
*  to that project precisely because she was such a staunch opponent of the corrupt figures [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=168.84s)]
*  in Ukraine who were helping Giuliani spin up this dirt, they trashed Yovanovitch's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=174.24s)]
*  reputation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=180.08s)]
*  Donald Trump ultimately removed her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=181.08s)]
*  And of course there was the infamous phone call in which Trump made military aid to Ukraine [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=183.24s)]
*  contingent upon Zelensky doing Trump a favor, announcing investigations into Joe Biden and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=188.5s)]
*  his son. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=195.36s)]
*  Trump froze congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine to pressure him. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=197.24s)]
*  All of this of course resulted in Donald Trump's first impeachment, but we tend to see Trump's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=203.16s)]
*  Ukraine debacle in terms of its domestic political consequences in America. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=207.2s)]
*  The consequences for Ukraine were far more serious. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=212.92s)]
*  What Ukraine needed was for Trump to support its new untested, uncorrupt president on the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=217.12s)]
*  world stage so he was taken seriously by his neighbors, including Russia, and by his fellow [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=222.2s)]
*  citizens. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=227.2s)]
*  So that he could be the real leader he needed to be in fending off Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=228.5s)]
*  Instead, Donald Trump chose to try to leverage the situation for his own political gain. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=233.46s)]
*  And for President Zelensky, having that military aid frozen, having the president of the United [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=239.62s)]
*  States try to shake him down, well that cost Zelensky in terms of power, it cost him in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=243.66s)]
*  terms of respect, it cost him in terms of his authority against Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=249.56s)]
*  And who can say what it might end up costing him now that he is in a war that may come [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=253.8s)]
*  down to a matter of small degrees here and there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Back then in 2019, when Zelensky called Trump, there was an opportunity for the American [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=264.98s)]
*  president to stand behind Ukraine, an opportunity to do better. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=269.86s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't take it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=276.12s)]
*  Of course, one of the reasons we even know about that phone call is because a national [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  named Alexander Vindman heard that call. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=282.26s)]
*  He was listening into it live. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=284.86s)]
*  He knew it was wrong. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=286.56s)]
*  He reported it up his chain of command. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=288.24s)]
*  And then he testified to the United States Congress about it in the impeachment hearing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=290.94s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=294.18s)]
*  Joining us now is the retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=295.18s)]
*  He was a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and a witness in President Trump's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=298.86s)]
*  first impeachment hearings. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=302.82s)]
*  Colonel Vindman, it is an honor to have you back with us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=304.42s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=306.96s)]
*  Your book titled Here Right Matters, you detailed this specific matter, the fact that you had [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=307.96s)]
*  provided you and your cohorts in the White House and the National Security Council had [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=313.68s)]
*  provided guidance and advice that President Trump was supposed to have read and taken [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=317.53999999999996s)]
*  to say you need do very little for Ukraine right now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  The congressional aid had already been approved and was on its way to Ukraine. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=325.4s)]
*  All you need to do is show this man support so that he can stand up against Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't do that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  He attempted to extort a investigation into his chief rival going into the 2020 election [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  and really undo our own electoral system and our democracy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=345.24s)]
*  So he's looking to harm us on that note, while at the same time undermining this brand new [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  leader, untested leader that was facing down a war with Russia, an ongoing war at that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=358.16s)]
*  point, ongoing for five years and attempting to avert what we see unfolding today. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=363.44s)]
*  So that kind of support that he needed with regards to arms, with regards to U.S. support, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=369.88s)]
*  he didn't get it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=375.04s)]
*  As a matter of fact, the Trump Ukraine scandal made Ukraine radioactive for the remainder [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=376.04s)]
*  of the Trump administration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=382.88s)]
*  And it actually had a chilling effect on the Biden administration because there was the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=384.72s)]
*  baggage of all these false accusations, accusations against Joe Biden. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  So the bottom line is that was really harmful all the way through. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=393.76s)]
*  There's a direct red line from that episode to really, frankly, where we are today because [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  Vladimir Putin saw a lot of opportunity in the lack of support to Ukraine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=403.48s)]
*  He saw a lot of opportunity in the fact that Ukraine was radioactive and that half of our [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=408.04s)]
*  political elites, the Republican Party, was bandwagoning cheerleading for Donald Trump. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=412.64s)]
*  And for Putin. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  I ask you this not to be, I ask you this not to be political because as you and I have [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  been talking over the last week, you know that I'm on the border and I'm seeing these [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=425.08s)]
*  Ukrainians come here in the freezing cold, try to find a home, escaping terror. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=428.8s)]
*  I just don't wish to have a political conversation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=433.36s)]
*  But in the end, we are seeing the Ukrainian resistance. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=436.26s)]
*  We are seeing the efforts that the Ukrainians are going to. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=439.52s)]
*  Whether this fails or succeeds for Ukrainians will come down to a matter of degrees. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=443.36s)]
*  And one day we may look back at this and said, had Donald Trump done something different? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  Had America done something different in that moment where you wrote the report, you wrote [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=451.6s)]
*  the brief that said, please just do this? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=454.94s)]
*  The end, the outcome might be different. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=458.5s)]
*  I think that's very true. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  I think it's clear to me that we were looking to avoid this major confrontation and Trump [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=463.26000000000005s)]
*  pushed us in the other direction. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=470.02000000000004s)]
*  We were always our policy, frankly, for two decades was soft on Russia, soft on Russian [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=471.70000000000005s)]
*  abuses towards its neighbors, towards the democracies, towards our security. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=477.94s)]
*  But if we were soft and we were entering in that direction, the Trump administration lurches [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-c8Biqwy4E&t=483.26s)]
