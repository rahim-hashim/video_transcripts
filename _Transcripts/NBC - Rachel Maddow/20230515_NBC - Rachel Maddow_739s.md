# E. Jean Carroll 'thrilled' to finally hold Donald Trump to account for his lies
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs)
*  Ms. Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, says she and her client are currently weighing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=0.0s)]
*  whether or not to bring yet another defamation suit against Donald Trump, this time for the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=4.38s)]
*  new iterations he made of these lies on television in the immediate wake of the verdict. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=9.0s)]
*  For the first time since he was elected president, E. Jean Carroll and her lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=14.22s)]
*  have proven in a court of law that Trump cannot tell lies with impunity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=19.34s)]
*  They have done that for the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  They were not the first to try, but they were the first to succeed, to hold Trump accountable [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=25.86s)]
*  by the American judicial system. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=30.54s)]
*  First time anybody has been able to do that since he was elected president. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=32.98s)]
*  They've already done that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=36.22s)]
*  Now they have to decide what to do next. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=39.18s)]
*  Joining us now for the interview is E. Jean Carroll and her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=42.14s)]
*  It is very nice to have you both here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=47.54s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=48.54s)]
*  I'm sorry I made you sit through that whole thing about the attack in Virginia and the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=49.54s)]
*  Durham report. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=52.68s)]
*  I just want to stand up and give you a standing ovation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=53.68s)]
*  I had realized that nobody had done this, that we're the first. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=57.92s)]
*  I just now realize that when you said it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=66.68s)]
*  Yeah, you, Robbie. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=69.32s)]
*  You did it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=70.32s)]
*  We as a country are inured to the idea, not just that politicians tell lies, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=73.92s)]
*  We're inured to the specific thing with Mr. Trump in which he lies about even checkable [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=79.88s)]
*  things and he lies in ways that are very hurtful, that are designed to ruin people's lives. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=86.32s)]
*  There's no consequences for it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=91.68s)]
*  All he does is benefit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=92.92s)]
*  Cruelty makes him seem stronger. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=94.42s)]
*  Cruelty makes him seem more macho. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=96.28s)]
*  Cruelty makes his view, his adoring public adore him all the more. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=98.12s)]
*  You are the first people to have punctured that by using the legal system to say you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=102.84s)]
*  have to be held accountable for what you say. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=106.56s)]
*  I was going to ask you how that felt, but you're only realizing it for the first time now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=109.2s)]
*  When the verdict came, I think we ascended to the ceiling. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=115.04s)]
*  We did. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=123.04s)]
*  And it was the happiest day of my life. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=124.04s)]
*  And on top of having the happiest day of our lives, we were so proud to be an American [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=127.04s)]
*  and see democracy actually work. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=136.64s)]
*  So to put that on top of our happiness, and Robbie was squeezed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=139.48s)]
*  You see this hand is three times smaller than it is. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=143.16s)]
*  Squeeze it so hard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=146.2s)]
*  It was thrilling. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  I could feel it in my very bones right down to my corpuscles. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  And I still have that feeling. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=158.11999999999998s)]
*  When you went through it again, I was again thrilled. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask about that question that I posited there about, I mean, you did force accountability. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=165.6s)]
*  And then he did it again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=174.68s)]
*  The defamation, the calling you a liar, the exact same things the jury held him liable [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=176.04s)]
*  for the day before. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=180.7s)]
*  He did again the next day on national television. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=181.7s)]
*  Is that just the way it has to be? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=184.74s)]
*  Do you think that potentially could be actionable? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  If you were to file another suit, would it work the same way? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=189.0s)]
*  So it's definitely actionable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=191.72s)]
*  And here the cruelty will make him less wealthy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=194.88s)]
*  He's not going to get away with it another time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=197.6s)]
*  It's unprecedented for a person to have been held liable in defamation to keep doing the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=201.32s)]
*  defamation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=207.12s)]
*  So there are not a lot of cases that we can look to for a playbook about how to do it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=208.6s)]
*  But suffice to say, I have a lot of lawyers who are very busy looking into this and we [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=212.72s)]
*  are weighing all of our options. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=217.04s)]
*  You also have another live case from the time when he was president and he was stating [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=220.16s)]
*  these same untrue things about you, defaming you in the same way. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=226.48s)]
*  That case is still working its way through the courts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=230.96s)]
*  What is your expectation in terms of what's going to happen there? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=234.28s)]
*  You're going to see news from us in that case very, very soon, Rachel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=236.88s)]
*  What counts as very soon? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  I don't know how late the people work tonight, two to three days max. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=241.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=244.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=245.92s)]
*  But we're going to, we're fully pursuing that case. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=246.92s)]
*  We got a nice, a very good decision from the DC Court of Appeals essentially affirming [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=248.98s)]
*  Judge Kaplan that when Trump said what he said about Eugene in 2019, he was not acting [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=252.64s)]
*  as president. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=258.92s)]
*  We're quite confident that that will be affirmed and then we'll be able to move forward with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=259.92s)]
*  damages in that case. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=264.06s)]
*  We don't even need a finding a liability because we already have it and we'll be able to find [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=265.3s)]
*  damages and there the defamation damages are much higher because that was the first statement [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=269.62s)]
*  And that's what really destroyed her reputation as an advice columnist at Elle and to all [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=274.78s)]
*  her readers and people who trusted her and looked up to her. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=279.73999999999995s)]
*  In terms of the timing here after those statements that are still at issue in this live case, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  as you mentioned, you were let go from Elle in terms of your job. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=286.82s)]
*  And you think that was related to his defamation? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, I know it was related. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you, Eugene, in terms of what you went through, there weren't cameras in the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=296.58s)]
*  whole country was following this word by word and we have the transcript and we know how [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=302.18s)]
*  your cross-examination in particular went. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=306.94s)]
*  And I think anybody with a drop of empathy knows that must have been very painful. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=309.22s)]
*  But you must have known it was going to be painful in the first instance when you set [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=314.62s)]
*  out to try to get your day in court here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=318.74s)]
*  Did things go the way that you thought they would? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=321.26s)]
*  Were they harder than you thought they would be or were you more prepared for how they [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=323.18s)]
*  were going to go than you expected? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=327.82s)]
*  How did it match up with your expectations and how you'd prepare? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=329.86s)]
*  I was ignorant. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=333.18s)]
*  I had never sued anybody. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=334.3s)]
*  I had never even been in a courtroom. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=336.38s)]
*  But Robby Kaplan, who I heard someone you might know say, when the history of this era [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=340.14s)]
*  is written, there'll be multiple chapters about Robby Kaplan. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  She and this brilliant team of lawyers had me so prepared, had me unbelievably prepared. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=353.86s)]
*  I went in because I was so ignorant, confident. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=362.34s)]
*  It was like getting hit by a board when Mr. Takapina did my cross-examination. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=367.38s)]
*  But I really wasn't doing it for myself. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=375.1s)]
*  I was doing it for the women in the country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=377.38s)]
*  And I got very little sleep. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=379.94s)]
*  You slayed it, though, E.G. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=388.14s)]
*  It was every day was exciting. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  It's an incredible feeling to feel the waves across the country behind us. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  And the end when I told what happened, I was heard. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=401.38s)]
*  I was heard in federal court. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=411.26s)]
*  I was heard in federal court in front of a jury of my peers. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=414.18s)]
*  They weighed the evidence. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=419.34s)]
*  And the truth was established. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=421.38s)]
*  And the system works. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=423.98s)]
*  It's amazing how this process worked after two weeks. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=425.54s)]
*  I was astounded that it actually worked. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=431.38s)]
*  And the reason it worked is Robby Kaplan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=435.74s)]
*  It helps to have a good lawyer to make the system work for you. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=438.38s)]
*  But I mean, you had a jury of nine, six men and three women on a jury. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=442.38s)]
*  There's no... Once things are in the hands of the jury, you never know what each individual juror [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=446.58000000000004s)]
*  is bringing to those deliberations, what their hangups or own experiences or prejudices [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  might be, despite the fact that the process is designed to make sure you have a fair jury. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=455.42s)]
*  Clearly, this is a ruling that shook the former president. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=460.62s)]
*  The prospect of more accountability to come appears to be very unsettling to him. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=463.98s)]
*  I think it is creating a sort of wave across the country of people feeling like you are [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=469.26s)]
*  speaking for a lot of people and not just yourself. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=472.86s)]
*  But Robby, you have sued this former president a lot. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=476.66s)]
*  And you have been the point of the spear for some of the legal accountability that he seems least able to handle. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=481.18s)]
*  And I wonder how that's changed your life. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=487.5s)]
*  Well, he doesn't like me very much, that's for sure. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=490.46s)]
*  And he's kind of obsessed with the fact that my firm and some of the lawyers I work with have other cases against him. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=492.62s)]
*  But I think in terms of my life, it's the same job, whether I'm suing Trump on behalf of Eugene [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  or we're suing the Charlottesville Nazis or we're suing someone else. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=505.65999999999997s)]
*  The job is the same. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=509.02000000000004s)]
*  It's to litigate the facts, to marshal the evidence, to convince a jury as we did in both cases. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  And here we had the best possible plaintiff and possible client to tell her story, to speak her truth. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=517.02s)]
*  And as we said on our team, just let Eugene be Eugene. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=523.54s)]
*  And she was and the jury loved her, as they should have. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=528.14s)]
*  Let me ask you as a matter of law and advocacy here. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=531.14s)]
*  This case has got me thinking about other people who have or may have defamation claims against the same former president, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=534.86s)]
*  people like the Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=542.2600000000001s)]
*  They have sued a few conservative media outlets and Rudy Giuliani for defamation. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=548.0600000000001s)]
*  They haven't sued the president himself, but arguably they've got the same kind of case to be able to make against him. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=551.62s)]
*  Do you think the success of this case doesn't just buoy people who feel like finally accountability, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=557.5s)]
*  finally truth being nailed to the wall and not led to slide down, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=564.86s)]
*  but doesn't have the potential to change the legal landscape for other civil cases against Trump? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=569.94s)]
*  I think it does because he's actually a very good defamation defendant if you're planning to sue for defamation because he lies all the time. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=574.14s)]
*  He lies as a matter of habit. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=583.86s)]
*  He lies about big things. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=585.54s)]
*  He lies about small things. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=586.66s)]
*  And in this case, we were able to show those lies not only about it being fake news and a hoax and a made up story, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=588.38s)]
*  but even when I showed him that famous photo where he mistook E. Jean for Marla Maples, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=595.78s)]
*  when he realized he'd made the mistake, he then said the photo is blurry. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=602.78s)]
*  The photo was not blurry, but it was classic Donald Trump. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=606.18s)]
*  And I think the jury really heard that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=608.98s)]
*  They really absorbed it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=611.5799999999999s)]
*  And that's why we got a verdict in two and a half hours. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  See, this is the reason that this is a bigger... [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=615.14s)]
*  I'm sorry to put it in these terms because I feel like I'm a little like casting a movie about it or something. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=618.7s)]
*  But you saying that it's a disadvantage that he lies so much, I feel like it's the first time I've heard that in seven years. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  The ability to lie without shame and without any sort of tell, without any sort of remorse about it whatsoever, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=630.1800000000001s)]
*  and about even the most important things has always seemed like a political superpower to him. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=638.5s)]
*  You've turned it into the opposite by virtue of the court system. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=643.46s)]
*  He's revived defamation law. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=646.6600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump single-handedly. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=649.5400000000001s)]
*  E. Jean, let me just ask you one last question here. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=650.98s)]
*  I was struck by what you said about Trump's latest comments on CNN. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=653.74s)]
*  And I know you didn't watch them live, which somehow gives me great comfort. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=657.3000000000001s)]
*  But you said his words wound people. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=661.5s)]
*  You used the plural there. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=664.6600000000001s)]
*  Not that they wound me or this is a way to wound women. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=666.58s)]
*  You're talking about the... [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=669.46s)]
*  I'm just struck by your use of the word people there, plural. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=671.74s)]
*  What do you... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=675.34s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=675.98s)]
*  Remember when he came... [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=677.98s)]
*  I've seen now clips of the CNN town hall. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=679.0600000000001s)]
*  When he came on stage right after our enormous victory and he made jokes about sexual assault, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  I couldn't believe the pain he was causing to thousands of people by joking about sexual assault. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=694.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's how he hurts people. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=704.42s)]
*  That's how he hurts people. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=706.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'd love to have Robbie Kaplan just shut him up. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=707.9s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll, Robbie Kaplan, thank you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=712.38s)]
*  Thank you, Rachael. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=715.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=715.9399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=716.4599999999999s)]
*  It's good to see you both. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GFHvxjUnNs&t=717.62s)]
