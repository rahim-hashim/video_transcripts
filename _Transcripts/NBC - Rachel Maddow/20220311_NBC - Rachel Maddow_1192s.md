# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 10
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8)
*  Putin is one, is actually the one person in the world with the unilateral ability to end [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=0.0s)]
*  this war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=7.12s)]
*  And since he does not appear willing to negotiate seriously at this stage, the question becomes, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  can anyone in Russia make him? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  At least roughly 14,000 anti-war protesters have already been arrested in Russia, and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=17.72s)]
*  almost all of Russia's independent media and social media has either been shuttered or [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=24.64s)]
*  muzzled, unable to report the reality of what's happening in Ukraine, unable to even refer [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=30.68s)]
*  to it as a war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=37.16s)]
*  Any truthful information that does get through is quickly spun by Russian-controlled state [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=40.24s)]
*  media. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=45.16s)]
*  Just yesterday, a Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=46.16s)]
*  Mariupol, killing two adults and one child and wounding 17 others. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=50.32s)]
*  But in the Russian press, the story is either that the hospital was empty or, more nefariously, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=55.92s)]
*  that the Ukrainian military did it themselves, firing artillery strikes on their own civilian [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=62.8s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, with state media lying this aggressively and all alternative sources shut down, how [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  can the Russian people be expected to oppose what Putin is doing, let alone voice that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=76.48s)]
*  opposition? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, Russian opposition figure Vladimir Kara-Mursa thinks this question is key. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Kara-Mursa has been such an effective force in resisting Putin in Russia over the years [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=87.28s)]
*  that the Kremlin poisoned him not once, but twice to try to get rid of him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=93.16s)]
*  This was Kara-Mursa's advice in the Washington Post this week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  As the world's democracies rightly prioritize helping Ukraine withstand Putin's aggression, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  they should not overlook the other important task, helping Russian citizens gain access [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=108.55999999999999s)]
*  to objective information about the war and the Putin regime in general. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=114.02s)]
*  Democratic nations must step up efforts to provide news coverage for Russian citizens [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  in the Russian language. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=125.1s)]
*  Modern leaders are learning the hard way that the instability, repression, and conflict [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=127.48s)]
*  Putin is causing will resolve only when he is out of power. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=132.4s)]
*  Only Russians can and should achieve this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=138.28s)]
*  The least the world's democracies can do is help them get access to the truth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=142.18s)]
*  Joining us now is the Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Mursa. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=148.44s)]
*  He's in Washington this week for meetings with members of Congress, a trip that took [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=151.72s)]
*  him two days to accomplish because of the closed airspace on the journey to D.C. from [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=156.26s)]
*  Moscow. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=161.22s)]
*  Mr. Kara-Mursa, thank you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=162.22s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=164.06s)]
*  You just left Moscow a few days ago. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=166.1s)]
*  We understand that Russian state media is spinning this war. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=168.86s)]
*  Help us understand, Vladimir, as you often do, how effective that spin is, what percentage [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=173.46s)]
*  of the Russian population buys into what the Putin government is saying, especially since [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=178.82s)]
*  they're seeing inflation and high interest rates and all sorts of other effects to their [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=183.84s)]
*  daily life. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=188.68s)]
*  Well, you just mentioned the word war. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=189.68s)]
*  Just for doing that, you could get up to 15 years in prison under a new law that was passed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=194.28s)]
*  literally last week that criminalized not only opposition to this war but actually even [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=199.44s)]
*  mentioning the fact that there is a war. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  It's a totally Orwellian reality that we are living with in Russia. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=207.52s)]
*  George Orwell's 1984 really did come to life under Vladimir Putin regime. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=212.0s)]
*  Remember, war is peace, freedom of slavery, ignorance and strength, a famous line from [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=217.72s)]
*  Orwell's novel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=224.12s)]
*  It is astonishing and frankly makes me proud that in the backdrop of that there are thousands [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=226.36s)]
*  of people all across Russia, as you've just shown to your viewers a few moments ago, who [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=231.0s)]
*  have been protesting going out all over the streets, all over the country, cities and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  towns across Russia to say that this is not our war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  These war crimes, these crimes against humanity that the Putin regime is unleashing on the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=243.88s)]
*  nation of Ukraine in the heart of Europe for the past two weeks, those crimes are not being [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  done and not being committed by the people of Russia. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=254.28s)]
*  Everybody's rightly focusing on the war of aggression, the actual war that Vladimir Putin [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=258.28s)]
*  has been leading against Ukraine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=264.6s)]
*  There is another war that the Kremlin regime has conducted very swiftly and very successfully, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=268.02s)]
*  and that has been the war on what remained of independent media in Russia and what remained [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=273.38s)]
*  of Russian civil society. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  Literally every single major independent media outlet in Russia has been shut down in the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=279.82s)]
*  past two weeks. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  This includes the legendary Echo of Moscow radio station that for years has been synonymous [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  with quality independent journalism in Russia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=290.9s)]
*  We have people already, dozens of people who have been indicted under this new clause, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=294.94s)]
*  under this new so-called defense of speaking out against the war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=300.94s)]
*  This includes today, for example, a Russian Orthodox priest in the region of Kostroma [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=304.06s)]
*  being charged and fined for speaking out against killings, against the war in his sermon in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  church. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=315.26s)]
*  That is now outlawed in Vladimir Putin's Russia. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=316.26s)]
*  And so the astonishing and mind-boggling fact, however incredulous it sounds, is that most [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=319.06s)]
*  people in Russia today do not even know that there is a war that Vladimir Putin's regime [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=324.54s)]
*  is conducting against Ukraine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  If you watch Russian state television, you live in this imagined reality where it's the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  West and the Ukrainian government that are to blame for the conflict. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=337.3s)]
*  And what Putin's military forces are doing are conducting a so-called targeted special [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=342.82000000000005s)]
*  operation that does not in any way affect civilians. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=347.42s)]
*  I think people who have been watching your channel and other world media and seen the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=350.58s)]
*  horrific images coming out of Ukraine can be the judges of that for themselves. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=354.1s)]
*  And given the threat to opposition leaders like yourself, to journalists, to protesters, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=361.58s)]
*  it's remarkable. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=369.74s)]
*  Something you told me years ago that always sticks with me. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=370.74s)]
*  Don't talk about Russians. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=372.98s)]
*  Talk about the Russian administration, the Russian government, the Putin regime, because [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=373.98s)]
*  Russians are not on side with this thing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  But you advocate something interesting. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=380.41999999999996s)]
*  You advocate for Western countries, democratic nations, to produce more Russian language [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=382.06s)]
*  journalism that shows what's actually happening in Ukraine, to burst the Russian state media's [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=386.94s)]
*  fake news bubble. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=392.68s)]
*  But how does that actually happen? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=394.64s)]
*  How do Western outlets actually get that kind of reporting to the Russian people now that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=396.18s)]
*  the Russian government has blocked out or shut out all opposing press? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, look, if this was done back in the Soviet times when those Western radio broadcasters, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=405.65999999999997s)]
*  you know, Radio Liberty, the BBC Russian service, Deutsche Welle and so on, beamed the radio [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=411.7s)]
*  signal through the Iron Curtain to reach millions of listeners inside the Soviet Union. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=416.5s)]
*  And you know, Soviet dissidents and Western analysts alike emphasized just how important [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=422.02s)]
*  that voice of truth, that voice of objective information was in delegitimizing the totalitarian [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=428.98s)]
*  regime in the eyes of its own people and eventually leading to the collapse of the communist system [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=436.06s)]
*  and the end of the Cold War. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=441.7s)]
*  You know, I think by now, better late than never, as they say, hopefully it is clear [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=443.18s)]
*  to the free world, to Western democracies that the only way to resolve the situation [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=448.7s)]
*  that has led us now to a major land war in the middle of Europe is to make sure that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=453.58s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is no longer in power. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  You know, for years and years, we in the Russian opposition have been warning Western democracies [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=462.06s)]
*  just where this appeasement of Putin will lead to. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=466.78s)]
*  And for all those years, unfortunately, Western leaders chose to live the other way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=470.97999999999996s)]
*  Western countries and Western financial systems and Western banks continue to essentially [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=474.82s)]
*  enable and bankroll the Putin kleptocracy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=479.02s)]
*  And this is where it led us. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=482.41999999999996s)]
*  I really wish we had been wrong on this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  But now, at least now, it should be clear to the civilized world that the only solution [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  to this is for political changes in Russia. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, needless to say, political change in Russia can and should only be accomplished [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=492.38s)]
*  by Russian citizens. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  Nobody advocates any kind of regime change from outside or any other nonsense of propaganda [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=498.94s)]
*  would have you believe. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=504.02000000000004s)]
*  But I think it is important that the free world helps the Russian people get access [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=505.02000000000004s)]
*  to the truth about the horrific crimes of the Putin regime is committing supposedly [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=510.58000000000004s)]
*  on their behalf. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=515.38s)]
*  It is important that the Putin kleptocracy and the Putin oligarchy is finally and fully [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=516.38s)]
*  cut out from the global financial system. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=521.7s)]
*  We are seeing this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=524.22s)]
*  There's more that needs to be done. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=525.58s)]
*  And it's also important to send a very clear message that the Western world and the United [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=527.34s)]
*  States in particular sees Vladimir Putin exactly for who he is, not a legitimate president, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=532.14s)]
*  not a democratically elected leader, because of course he isn't, but as an unlawful, illegitimate [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=536.94s)]
*  usurper. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=541.86s)]
*  There's a very important congressional initiative here in the United States. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=542.86s)]
*  It's called House Resolution 806 that was introduced on the bipartisan level a few weeks [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=547.14s)]
*  ago that calls for derecognition, official derecognition of Vladimir Putin's regime by [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=553.46s)]
*  the United States in the same way that Maduro's regime in Venezuela and Lukashenko's regime [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=558.86s)]
*  in Belarus and others are not recognized. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=563.54s)]
*  I hope to see this initiative pass swiftly. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=566.02s)]
*  All the more added urgency now as Vladimir Putin is conducting war crimes and crimes [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  against humanity at the heart of Europe. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  Throughout this crisis, the world has turned to journalists who live in Ukraine to get [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=578.22s)]
*  a firsthand perspective of what's happening. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=581.78s)]
*  One of these journalists is named Aliam Kent. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=584.62s)]
*  Aliam Kent was among the many people in Ukraine forced to flee the country for the refugee [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=587.6999999999999s)]
*  camps in neighboring Poland. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=592.38s)]
*  Since arriving in Poland, Aliam Kent and her reporting partner, Romana Isabella, have been [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=595.06s)]
*  documenting the experiences of Ukrainian refugees for a video project called Diaries in Exile. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=599.6999999999999s)]
*  Their work puts a human face on the victims of this war by capturing not just their trials [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=607.5s)]
*  and hardship, but also moments of laughter and levity experienced by real people keeping [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=612.1s)]
*  hope alive every day. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=617.3s)]
*  How did you get a piano here? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=625.9s)]
*  It's mine. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=628.9s)]
*  I used to travel with this piano everywhere I go. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=629.9s)]
*  Wow, how do you travel with it? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=632.9s)]
*  Do you see a trailer over there? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=634.9s)]
*  That's the piano. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=636.9s)]
*  Joining us now is Aliam Kent, a Ukraine-based journalist and producer of Diaries in Exile. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=684.9s)]
*  Aliam, thank you for being with us. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=697.9s)]
*  You are seeing things I'm trying to capture. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=699.9s)]
*  You're doing it much better than I am, but you're capturing the humanity of these refugees. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=702.9s)]
*  You are taking them away from being an abstraction because when people hear, you know, a million [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=707.9s)]
*  and a half refugees or two million refugees, it's hard to understand that each one of these [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=712.9s)]
*  are individual lives lived. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=717.9s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=721.9s)]
*  That's exactly what we're trying to do with this series. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=723.9s)]
*  I want to ask you about some of the lighter moments. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=729.9s)]
*  There aren't really light moments in refugee sites, but one of the things you did happened [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=733.9s)]
*  during an interview with a 17-year-old boy from Odessa and your reaction. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=737.9s)]
*  I just want to play that for our audience. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=743.9s)]
*  Yes, there are situations where many people don't understand anything, but everything is clear here. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=747.9s)]
*  It's just that politics is to blame for everything. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=751.9s)]
*  People are not to blame for anything. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=755.9s)]
*  Who lost his grandmother? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=757.9s)]
*  The [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=759.9s)]
*  people. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=760.88s)]
*  Who lost his grandmother? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=762.88s)]
*  The people. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=764.88s)]
*  I'm at a train station, so I'm getting constant announcements like you can hear now about the next train coming in, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=770.88s)]
*  but you got an announcement about who lost their grandmother. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=775.88s)]
*  There is some strength in the human spirit in which people laugh, they tell jokes, they are trying to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=778.88s)]
*  grab some little piece of life to continue on even in this horrible situation. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=786.86s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=793.86s)]
*  While Romana and I are running around trying to capture these human moments, we find pain that we share alongside with these people. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=795.86s)]
*  We find humor. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=804.86s)]
*  I'd say that that's how this war is also being perceived. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=805.86s)]
*  My friends and I were reading the news constantly, but we're also sharing memes with each other. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=808.86s)]
*  It's a very Ukrainian way. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=812.86s)]
*  I'd say of coping and being able to live through this process. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=815.84s)]
*  Every last person I talk to ends when they talk to me in an interview with the expression, glory to Ukraine. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=820.84s)]
*  Slavo-Ukraine. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=827.84s)]
*  They all talk about the fact that they are going home, not that they hope they're going home. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=829.84s)]
*  What is it about the Ukrainian spirit that is allowing the people to stay back and fight and everybody who leaves to say we're going back? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=834.84s)]
*  I think that's just who Ukrainians are at their core. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=842.82s)]
*  The rest of the world is really meeting the people for the first time for many. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=846.82s)]
*  And that is one of the regular themes, I would say, from all of the people we have spoken to. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=852.82s)]
*  They have indeed said that they're all planning on returning home. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=857.82s)]
*  When asking what's next, it's a very scary question. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=860.82s)]
*  Many people are lost. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=864.82s)]
*  They don't know what's going to happen next. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=865.82s)]
*  But the one thing they have in mind is going back and rebuilding their country on their own. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  And that really tells the spirit and the belief that the people have in themselves and their country. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's why many haven't lost hope. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  Tell me what you want Western audiences to understand. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=883.8000000000001s)]
*  It becomes very hard when we report, as I say, on these mass numbers and these people who are going out. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=886.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you want people to understand about Ukrainians through the work that you're doing? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  I want people to understand that Ukrainians are just like anybody else, but they are their own very unique individual people. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  They're different from Russians, even though they're Russian speaking Ukrainians. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=909.8000000000001s)]
*  They're different from the people in the countries that they border, which are EU countries. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  And they're trying to progress towards a society. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  So it's a constantly changing culture, constantly changing country. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=925.78s)]
*  And they're being attacked for their beliefs of freedom and democracy. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=928.78s)]
*  So that's really who they are as people. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=933.78s)]
*  I'd say that's why you're seeing how they're reacting now. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=937.78s)]
*  So I'd hope that people are inspired, meeting the people and continue to support. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=940.78s)]
*  Aliam Kent is a journalist and producer of Diaries in Exile, which you can find on YouTube starting today. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=948.78s)]
*  Aliam, thank you for your time tonight and for this project. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=954.76s)]
*  It is bitterly cold here in Zahon, Hungary, for the nearly 215,000 evacuees who fled Ukraine, some of whom are waiting at this train station. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=959.76s)]
*  The real feel is 18 degrees Fahrenheit right now. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=969.76s)]
*  Earlier I spoke with a young woman named Marta. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=972.76s)]
*  She's from the city of Rivne in western Ukraine. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=975.76s)]
*  Marta was escorted this far by her mother, who will be heading back into Ukraine while she travels onward. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=979.74s)]
*  Listen to our conversation. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=984.74s)]
*  And tell me about your journey here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=988.74s)]
*  Now I'm going to Budapest, later to Spain. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=990.74s)]
*  But I don't want to. I want to leave my country, my home. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=995.74s)]
*  But my parents decided to take us to Spain. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=999.74s)]
*  After we woke up at 6 a.m. from exclusion of our airport in my city and after... [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1003.72s)]
*  ...and after... [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1017.72s)]
*  ...thrilling in my city and terrible in my... [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1019.72s)]
*  The sirens just say that there are bombs or attacks. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1023.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1026.72s)]
*  Did you hear them? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1027.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1028.72s)]
*  The second day of the war, the second day in my city, exclusion of our airport near my house. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1030.7s)]
*  So how did you get out? How did you leave from your home? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1040.7s)]
*  My parents... [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1047.7s)]
*  My parents said to me, you must leave and we go. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1049.7s)]
*  Who have you traveled with? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1059.68s)]
*  I traveled with my mother, but she can't stay with us in Spain because she must continue her job in Kiev and look after her parents in Ukraine. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1061.68s)]
*  And we will stay in Spain with my sister alone, with family and friends. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1075.68s)]
*  So your mother is going to go back now? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1081.68s)]
*  Yeah, because she has parents in Ukraine and my father to stay in Ukraine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1084.68s)]
*  Does that scare you? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1094.66s)]
*  Yeah. Very. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1096.66s)]
*  It's very sad because I'm really scared and worried about my parents, about my country and I can't understand why I must leave my home and my country. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1098.66s)]
*  Tell me about your father who stayed behind? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1110.66s)]
*  My father, yes. He stayed in Ukraine and I really miss him because I love him so much and I don't... [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1113.64s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1123.64s)]
*  I don't understand why I must leave my country, my home. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1127.64s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1134.64s)]
*  I'm so sorry that you had to leave. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1136.64s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. I appreciate it and I hope that your journey is safe and I hope you get to go home really soon. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1139.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll be back in Ukraine and we will upgrade our country and I hope as soon as I can I will be back in Ukraine. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK14iKfFqu8&t=1145.6200000000001s)]
