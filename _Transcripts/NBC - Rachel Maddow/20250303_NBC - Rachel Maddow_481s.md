# Trump giveaways to Russia with no concessions make a mockery of his 'dealmaker' image
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk)
*  Just a moment ago, I showed you some of the protests that greeted Vice President JD Vance [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=0.0s)]
*  when he tried to go skiing this weekend at Sugarbush in Vermont. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Waitsfield, Vermont absolutely filled up with people telling him to get out of town. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=10.8s)]
*  JD Vance is a traitor. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=15.72s)]
*  Go ski in Russia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=17.48s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=20.12s)]
*  Do not underestimate the stamina and determination and cold tolerance of New Englanders when [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=21.12s)]
*  it gets to this part of the winter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=26.3s)]
*  They can pretty much take anything. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  So not only did they protest JD Vance at the ski mountain up in Waitsfield, Vermont, telling [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=29.92s)]
*  him to get out of town, there was also a whole other group of protesters waiting for him [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=34.68s)]
*  when he tried to get out of town. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  This wasn't Waitsfield. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=41.1s)]
*  Just drop the chyron here so people can see here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=42.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  This was the route to the airport for JD Vance in South Burlington, Vermont. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Protesters also turned up there sending him off as he tried to leave the state. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=49.08s)]
*  They called it his farewell sendoff. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  And you know, it wasn't just Vermont getting out in the streets to show their support for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  Ukraine and their objections to the United States, aligning itself with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  This was Charlotte, North Carolina this weekend and Bentonville, Arkansas and Washington, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=63.86s)]
*  D.C. and Seattle, Washington this weekend. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=69.14s)]
*  Protesters holding pro-Ukraine anti-Russia demonstrations in the wake of President Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=72.02s)]
*  and Vice President JD Vance, aligning themselves with the Russian Federation and against our [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=77.82s)]
*  ally. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=83.86s)]
*  And that was this weekend. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=84.86s)]
*  Now today we are confronting a series of headlines that seem to make it official. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegsath orders a halt to cyber operations against Russia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=92.18s)]
*  Trump administration halting cyber operations against Russia, even as Russia appears to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=97.78s)]
*  have intensified its cyber operations against our allies in NATO and in Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=101.86s)]
*  Further news just tonight as we're getting on the air that the United States is not only [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=108.26s)]
*  starting the process of dropping sanctions on Russia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=112.38s)]
*  The White House reported the ordering the Treasury Department and the State Department [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=116.62s)]
*  to explore the end to Russian sanctions, but also now putting a stop to all U.S. aid to [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=119.98s)]
*  Ukraine in the middle of this war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=127.42s)]
*  Joining us now is NBC News correspondent Courtney Kuby. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=130.94s)]
*  She covers the Pentagon and national security. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=133.02s)]
*  Courtney, it's really nice of you to make time to be here tonight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=134.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=136.78s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=137.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=138.78s)]
*  Can you put sort of in layman's terms for us what these things together mean? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  We've seen the headline about cyber command. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=145.94s)]
*  We've seen the headline about dropping Russian sanctions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=147.9s)]
*  We've seen the headline about pausing all U.S. aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=150.22s)]
*  Can you help us understand what what viewers might need to understand about what this means [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=154.74s)]
*  for this U-turn in the U.S. government? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=160.14s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=162.22s)]
*  So I mean, there's really two sides to this argument. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=164.3s)]
*  There are the people who believe that this is just part of negotiating, that you make [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=166.7s)]
*  sacrifices or some changes during negotiation, whether it's a show of good faith or getting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=171.7s)]
*  the other side to the table. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=176.42s)]
*  And then there are other people who clearly think this is nothing but capitulation to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=178.14s)]
*  Russia. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=181.38s)]
*  So the two sides broken down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=182.38s)]
*  What the cyber command decision or order from Secretary of Defense Pete Hagseth does is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  it is pausing all offensive cyber operations against Russia and all offensive information [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  operations against Russia. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=196.1s)]
*  But the key here is we don't know how long this is supposed to last. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=197.86s)]
*  There are some officials who say this is while the U.S. is actively involved in trying to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  be this mediator between Russia and Ukraine to try to end the war. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=207.22000000000003s)]
*  And there are others who say, look, we don't have any sense of what the timeline could [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  be and when this actually could end. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=214.5s)]
*  Now, there are critics or people who are concerned that this is this is a time where the United [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=216.74s)]
*  States should be stepping up their gathering on Russia, particularly when it comes to information [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  operations. But at this point, it appears that all of that is halted. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=227.14s)]
*  And the timeline, again, is really unclear for that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=232.1s)]
*  The next issue on the weapons on these the military equipment that the United States [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=235.18s)]
*  has been flowing in and Rachel, you know, whether there whether people are in favor of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  actually sending these weapons and this equipment to Ukraine or not, there is no doubt that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=245.62s)]
*  this has been a logistical feat and hurdle to get these billions and billions of dollars [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=250.54s)]
*  of in some cases, massive equipment, weapons, ammunition into Ukraine so that they've [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=257.34s)]
*  been able to stave off the Russian offensive that began just over three years ago. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=264.9s)]
*  Well, we've learned late today is that, in fact, the Trump administration, at least for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=269.3s)]
*  now, again, has paused the delivery of any additional military weapons or equipment [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=273.38s)]
*  to Ukraine. Now, you may say, well, we haven't been hearing about the Trump administration [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=279.58s)]
*  announcing any additional sending of any additional weapons. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=285.14s)]
*  And that is right. Basically, the Biden administration used almost all of the money that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=289.34s)]
*  they had allocated to send to to to buy weapons or to send from U.S. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=294.78s)]
*  stockpiles and then reimburse U.S. stockpiles for Ukraine. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=300.29999999999995s)]
*  There was about three three point eight or so billion dollars that were left in that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=303.62s)]
*  But there's not any money that's still left to reimburse the U.S. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=307.42s)]
*  military for that. So that money has basically been paused. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=311.74s)]
*  There really hasn't been any new spending to Ukraine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=314.98s)]
*  But there was money. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=318.7s)]
*  If there was still additional weapons and equipment that were being sent as part of other [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=320.7s)]
*  disbursements. So, for instance, one of the last presidential drawdown authority announcements [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=324.94s)]
*  had some refurbished vehicles. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  Those were still being flown into Ukraine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=332.22s)]
*  And then there's another pot of money that has existed for the last three years called [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=334.54s)]
*  the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=338.7s)]
*  That's sort of longer term weapons systems and equipment that could take years in some [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=340.86s)]
*  cases to deliver to Ukraine. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=344.42s)]
*  What we found out tonight is that the United States is pausing all of those shipments for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=346.42s)]
*  now. And again, just like the Cyber Command decision, it's just not how clear that's going [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=351.1s)]
*  to last. Now, why I keep going back to how long these decisions and these these these [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=356.82s)]
*  announcements will last is because it will prove whether this really is something that the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=362.3s)]
*  United States has decided to do as part of a negotiation or whether it is, as some have [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=367.74s)]
*  claimed, that this could be a sign of in an effort to to that President Trump has made [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  very clear that he wants to normalize relations with Moscow, that this could be part of a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  capitulation to that effort, Rachel. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  And just to be clear, with all of these things that that Russia has now received effectively, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  just in terms of deal points from from the U.S. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=392.54s)]
*  government, you know, halting aid to Ukraine, ending sanction, moving to end sanctions on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=395.26s)]
*  Russia, having a high level U.S. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  government meeting between the Russian U.S. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  government, President Trump publicly advocating that Russia be let back in the G7, saying that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=405.1s)]
*  he wants to have a one on one summit with with Vladimir Putin, Russia being invited to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=410.06s)]
*  reopen their embassy in full consulate strength in the United States with all of these things [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  that the U.S. has now given to Russia in terms of deal points. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  Has Russia given us anything? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=425.38s)]
*  If so, it's not nothing that we are aware of at this point. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, and you know, officials, we know when the cybercom thing first came up, officials were [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=433.02s)]
*  saying, look, the United States needs to show some good faith here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=437.86s)]
*  So is it possible that Russia will give something? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=440.7s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky has made it very clear that he doesn't believe that Russia will negotiate in [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=443.42s)]
*  good faith in any way. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=447.14s)]
*  At this point, we're not aware of anything that they have given to the U.S. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=449.06s)]
*  for these things. Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=451.46000000000004s)]
*  At some point, the math doesn't work, right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  Cardinal Kubi, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=457.54s)]
*  I really appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPl5qTeRFEk&t=459.5s)]
