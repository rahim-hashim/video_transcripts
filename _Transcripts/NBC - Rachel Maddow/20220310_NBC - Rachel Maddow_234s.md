# For Some Ukrainian Parents, Escape To Border Is A Round Trip
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA)
*  It is bitterly cold here in Zahon, Hungary, for the nearly 215,000 evacuees who fled Ukraine, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=0.0s)]
*  some of whom are waiting at this train station. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=9.4s)]
*  The real feel is 18 degrees Fahrenheit right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=12.08s)]
*  Earlier I spoke with a young woman named Marta. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=15.32s)]
*  She's from the city of Rivne in western Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=17.96s)]
*  Marta was escorted this far by her mother, who will be heading back into Ukraine while [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=20.76s)]
*  she travels onward. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=26.22s)]
*  Listen to our conversation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=27.88s)]
*  And tell me about your journey here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=30.64s)]
*  Now I'm going to Budapest, later to Spain, but I don't want to. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=32.64s)]
*  I want to leave my country, my home, but my parents decided to take us to Spain after [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=39.6s)]
*  We woke up at 6 a.m. from exclusion of our airport in my city and after, and after, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=49.76s)]
*  siren sounding in my city and it's terrible in my... [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=62.76s)]
*  The sirens just say that there are bombs or attacks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=66.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=69.72s)]
*  Did you hear them? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=70.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=71.72s)]
*  Second day of the war, second day in my city, exclusion of our airport near my house. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=72.72s)]
*  How did you get out? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=83.48s)]
*  How did you leave from your home? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=84.48s)]
*  My parents said to me, you must leave and we go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=90.48s)]
*  Who have you traveled with? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=101.28s)]
*  I traveled with my mother, but she can't stay with us in Spain because she must continue [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=103.28s)]
*  her job in Kiev and look after her parents in Ukraine and we will stay in Spain with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=112.52s)]
*  my sister alone, with family, friends. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=120.6s)]
*  So your mother is going to go back now? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=123.6s)]
*  Yeah, because she has parents in Ukraine and my father to stay in Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=127.36s)]
*  Does that scare you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=137.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=138.4s)]
*  Very. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=139.4s)]
*  It's very sad because I'm really scared and worried about my parents, about my country [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=140.4s)]
*  and I can't understand why I must leave my home and my country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Tell me about your father who stayed behind. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=152.96s)]
*  My father stayed in Ukraine and I really miss him because I love him so much and I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=156.0s)]
*  don't understand why I must leave my country, my home. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=165.4s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=175.4s)]
*  I'm so sorry that you had to leave. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=177.4s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=182.16s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=183.16s)]
*  I hope that your journey is safe and I hope you get to go home really soon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=184.32s)]
*  I'll be back in Ukraine and we will upgrade our country and I hope as soon as I can I [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=187.32s)]
*  will be back in Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=197.32s)]

*  You're welcome. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=200.32s)]
*  After we finished recording she said to me, how does this happen in 2022? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=205.32s)]
*  And then she said to me, humanity is in crisis. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLfXFky9-SA&t=210.32s)]
