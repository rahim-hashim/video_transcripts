Video Description: Rachel Maddow rounds up instances in which Donald Trump not only assures his supporters that if he is elected they won't have to vote in the future, but also that even for this 2024 election he does not need votes. Maddow posits that the reason Trump doesn't care about votes is that he intends to win by manipulating the administration of the voting tabulation.

# Maddow points out frightening truth about Trump's lack of concern about votes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg)
*  But I said there's a lot going on at the surface level in terms of donors and campaign positions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=0.0s)]
*  and campaign strategy and the way they're behaving in public. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=7.76s)]
*  There's a lot that is weird about this campaign thus far. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=11.0s)]
*  But there is one last thing in terms of the weirdness of this campaign that I think is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=14.58s)]
*  actually quite serious. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=17.68s)]
*  You probably heard this weekend that Donald Trump told an audience on Friday night that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=21.32s)]
*  if they vote for him this November, if he's voted back into office this November, they [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=26.0s)]
*  will never have to vote again. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=31.2s)]
*  He told an audience on Friday to quote, get out and vote just this time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=34.6s)]
*  He said after this time, quote, you won't have to do it anymore. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=39.06s)]
*  You won't have to vote anymore. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=42.6s)]
*  He said, quote, in four years, you don't have to vote again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=44.44s)]
*  We'll have it fixed so good and you're not going to have to vote. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Now this is not the first time Trump has told a campaign audience that they will never [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=53.2s)]
*  have to vote again once they vote him back in this time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=56.96s)]
*  And that is as alarming as it sounds for all the reasons that you immediately think it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  is, right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=64.28s)]
*  I mean, he's positing this like this is a happy thing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=65.28s)]
*  Oh joy, never having the burden of voting again, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  The point of democracy is that we vote all the time and we like it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  That's how we decide what happens in our country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=76.28s)]
*  He's promising his followers that he'll end all of that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=78.36s)]
*  And it just it's exactly what you think it is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=81.32s)]
*  But let me also point out something more strange, which has been happening at the same time [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  and it hasn't had as much attention. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  The day before Trump made those remarks on Friday, on Friday, he said, you're never going [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  to have to vote again after you vote for me this one time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  The day before that on Thursday last week, he didn't say that people wouldn't have to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=101.96s)]
*  vote anymore once he was elected this November. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  Now, the day before that on Thursday, he told his supporters. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=109.4s)]
*  Not that they're not going to have to vote again, but that they don't have to vote this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=114.56s)]
*  time. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=118.16s)]
*  But they don't need to vote for him this November. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=119.92s)]
*  My instruction, we don't need the votes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=126.24s)]
*  I have so many votes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=128.04s)]
*  My instruction, we don't need the votes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=130.46s)]
*  I have so many votes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=132.44s)]
*  He said that on Thursday last week. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=133.64s)]
*  And it turns out this is something when you look, he says this all the time now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=137.44s)]
*  But. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=141.4s)]
*  My instruction, we don't need the votes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=144.4s)]
*  I have so many votes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=146.24s)]
*  We don't need votes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=147.52s)]
*  I tell my people, I don't need any votes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=148.52s)]
*  We got all the votes we need. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=151.08s)]
*  I don't need votes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=152.36s)]
*  We don't need votes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=153.36s)]
*  We got more votes than anybody's ever had. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=154.36s)]
*  You don't have to vote. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=156.68s)]
*  Don't worry about voting. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=157.68s)]
*  The voting, we got plenty of votes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=158.68s)]
*  Don't worry about voting. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=161.16s)]
*  Of all the weirdness around this campaign, this is a truly strange thing to tell people, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=165.12s)]
*  right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=171.24s)]
*  Don't vote. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=172.24s)]
*  I don't need your vote. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=173.24s)]
*  I don't want your vote. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=174.24s)]
*  I mean, all the surface level weirdness is, you know, worth noting. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=175.24s)]
*  Having a new position on literally anything you can think of as soon as any random rich [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=179.4s)]
*  guy tells you to, that's a weird thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=183.36s)]
*  Picking the eccentric billionaire's intern for your running mate, even though you apparently [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  had no idea who he was or what a disaster he is on television, all of this is weird. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  But telling voters, do not bother to vote for me, it doesn't matter if you do, I don't [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=194.44s)]
*  need your votes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=198.44s)]
*  That is a thing that should prick up your ears. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=200.4s)]
*  Because what that means is that he doesn't think he needs to win the vote to win the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  election. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=208.32s)]
*  He doesn't think he needs to win the election in order to take power. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  He thinks something other than votes is going to determine whether or not he gets back in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=214.44s)]
*  the White House. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=219.32s)]
*  At Rolling Stone today, they profile 70 different election officials who have been put into [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=223.16s)]
*  position in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=227.32s)]
*  who are election denialists, committed election denialists, officials that have been put in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=232.96s)]
*  place in all of those swing states to make sure that election results, no matter what [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=238.34s)]
*  they are, do not get certified in those states this year. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=241.98s)]
*  Quote, at least 22 of these election officials have already refused or delayed certification [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=246.28s)]
*  processes in recent elections. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=252.16s)]
*  According to Democratic election lawyer Mark Elias, quote, I think we are going to see [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=255.52s)]
*  mass refusals to certify the election in November. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=258.7s)]
*  Quote, Republicans are counting on not just that they can disrupt the election in big [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=262.28s)]
*  counties, they're counting on the fact that if they don't certify in several small counties, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=267.0s)]
*  you can't certify statewide results. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=272.34s)]
*  We see officials in place across just the swing states. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=277.3s)]
*  For all the surface level weird behavior and language and strange choices and incoherence [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=282.92s)]
*  and odd donors in the Republican campaign, the serious core at the heart of it is that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=288.44s)]
*  they are not planning on the vote being counted as normal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  They are not counting on the election results being tallied as normal. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=298.1s)]
*  They are not counting on the vote. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, Trump is now repeatedly saying the vote will not matter. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=304.06s)]
*  He doesn't even want your vote. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=308.54s)]
*  The Republicans are counting on the election results not being certified, thereby creating [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=311.52s)]
*  chaos in Washington around the results, just like 2020, right? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=318.42s)]
*  Just like January 6th, 2021, except this time with no Mike Pence in the way and with Republican [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=322.22s)]
*  in place in multiple states saying, yeah, you may not get any sort of official vote. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=328.56s)]
*  The weirdness of this campaign is astonishing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=337.48s)]
*  Ninety nine days out, the dislocation from real campaigning, though, the dislocation [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=339.68s)]
*  from actually asking asking people for their votes. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=346.96s)]
*  That means something. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=349.8s)]
*  It means they are not trying to win this thing in a normal way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=351.0s)]
*  So 99 days out, as Democrats stand up what by all accounts looks like a juggernaut traditional [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  campaign under Kamala Harris. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=362.36s)]
*  Are they prepared for this level of weirdness after the votes are cast? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=364.8s)]
*  Are they ready for what's coming? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=369.74s)]
*  You [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9OP_a6MNg&t=386.6s)]
