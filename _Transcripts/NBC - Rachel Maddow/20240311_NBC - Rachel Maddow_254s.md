# How Russia duped two Republicans with propaganda laundered through fake news sites
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ)
*  In the days after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed in an Arctic prison in Russia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a Russian website that was made to look like a news outlet [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=6.24s)]
*  posted what it claimed was a leaked audio recording of two high-level US State Department officials [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=9.92s)]
*  discussing who should replace Navalny as leader of the Russian opposition. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=16.32s)]
*  The implication, of course, was that there's no real Russian opposition to Vladimir Putin, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=20.72s)]
*  that anybody in Russia who's opposed to Putin must be part of an American front, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=25.76s)]
*  must be part of what is in effect a US government creation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=29.6s)]
*  Like Navalny wasn't a real resistance leader, he wasn't a real opposition figure, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=33.2s)]
*  he was just a tool of the American government, and they'd pick a new one to replace him now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=37.92s)]
*  This supposedly leaked audio was so obviously fake it would fool exactly no one. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=43.68s)]
*  A State Department official told the Daily Beast, which broke the story, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=50.0s)]
*  quote, in case the thick Russian accents pretending to be US officials were not clear, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=52.96s)]
*  yes, we can confirm this audio is fake. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=58.72s)]
*  But still, it doesn't have to appear to be all that real, you launder it, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=63.2s)]
*  You say it's been cited here, you describe it here, you move it into another fake news site here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=68.56s)]
*  The Russians successfully got this idea into circulation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=74.56s)]
*  For a time, if you searched the names of the people in this story, the US government officials [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=77.92s)]
*  who were named as the supposed source of this leaked audio in the story, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=83.92s)]
*  the hoax audio came up as results number two and number three on Google. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=89.28s)]
*  And if you clicked through to the quote unquote news story, you would be taken to this site, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=93.6s)]
*  the Miami Chronicle, which at first glance might appear to be an actual Florida news site. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=97.92s)]
*  At one point, it featured the tagline, Florida news since 1937, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=104.08s)]
*  and it's created by Russians. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=108.24s)]
*  So is this very similar looking one, not the famous New York Daily News, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=116.8s)]
*  but instead the New York News Daily. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=120.56s)]
*  Also, here's another one, the Chicago Chronicle. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=124.24s)]
*  That sounds like it could be a real paper. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=127.28s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=129.12s)]
*  Or this one, the DC Weekly. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=130.0s)]
*  All of these different sites have the same mix of AI generated stories [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=132.88s)]
*  on right-wing hot button issues like crime and immigration, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=137.28s)]
*  plus a whole slew of stories advancing the Kremlin line on the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=140.4s)]
*  Not long ago, the DC Weekly site posted an entirely made up story [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=147.28s)]
*  about Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky spending tens of millions of dollars on a pair of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=152.0s)]
*  yachts, yachts for himself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=157.68s)]
*  The story was total bullpucky, but it's perfectly designed to spread on social media as if it were [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=161.12s)]
*  from some real news site, which it is not. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=166.96s)]
*  At least one Republican member of Congress and one Republican senator then cited the fake yachts [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=170.24s)]
*  as a reason to oppose approving any more funding for Ukraine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Republican Senator JD Vance, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=181.36s)]
*  And while that's hilarious about them, in all seriousness, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine funding is still being blocked by Republicans in Congress. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=191.36s)]
*  These very obvious Russian fake news sites are proliferating right now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=196.96s)]
*  And again, they are not sophisticated. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  You spend just a few seconds on one of these sites and you quickly realize this is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  not, say, a newspaper that has been bringing you Florida news since 1937. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=207.36s)]
*  But these efforts do not have to be sophisticated to spread disinformation effectively. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  You just launder it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  You just spread it around. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=218.24s)]
*  You say you've seen it somewhere else. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=219.28s)]
*  You get the government to comment on it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  If you can just get it into the bloodstream, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=224.16s)]
*  if you can just lend a sort of aura of credibility to posts flying by in any social media feed, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=226.32s)]
*  mission accomplished. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE4MJ0AiccQ&t=232.48s)]
