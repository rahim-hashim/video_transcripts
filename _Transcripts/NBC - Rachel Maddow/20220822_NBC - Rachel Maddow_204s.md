# 'Staggering': Schiff On NYT Report Of Quantity, Range Of Classified Mar-a-Lago Materials
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA)
*  Let me first just get your reaction to this breaking news from The New York Times tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=0.0s)]
*  Quantifying for the first time the amount of classified information that may be in question [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=4.32s)]
*  with the former president's estate in Florida, The Times is reporting that the FBI has now obtained [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=9.6s)]
*  more than 300 different classified documents from Trump's home that reportedly include documents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=15.84s)]
*  from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI. What's your reaction to that reporting? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=22.72s)]
*  Well, it's staggering and for all the reasons that you mentioned, just the sheer volume of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=29.2s)]
*  classified documents. It's not like there was a classified paper mixed in with a bunch of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=33.92s)]
*  unrelated information. It seems that it must be quite deliberate if the volume is that great [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=39.04s)]
*  and if the reporting is accurate, it covered a broad range of topics. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=45.84s)]
*  There goes, frankly, Rachel, my theory, which was that he was bringing home a bunch of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=50.16s)]
*  Russia-related documents that he thought might be beneficial to him somehow. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=55.04s)]
*  If they covered a wide variety of topics, it really begs the question, what was he doing? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  What was he thinking? What was the purpose behind this? And then finally, evidence that he reviewed [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  them himself is going to make it much more difficult to voice responsibility onto others, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=71.19999999999999s)]
*  which as you point out, is a favorite pastime of the former president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=76.24s)]
*  Yeah, that is striking reporting, if the Times' reports are accurate, that last year, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=80.96s)]
*  so before the government was able to start obtaining this material and getting it back, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=86.8s)]
*  Trump, they're saying, personally went through these boxes, meaning that he personally reviewed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=91.6s)]
*  this material before withholding, before deciding to withhold more of the material that was marked [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=97.2s)]
*  classified and not handed over. That would seem to indicate that the president is potentially [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=103.36s)]
*  personally implicated here in a way that can't be passed off as a systems problem or a staffing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=109.36s)]
*  problem or a communication problem, right? I think that's exactly right. What has struck [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=114.4s)]
*  me about this story from the beginning, and of course, we had no heads up about the search or [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=120.24s)]
*  anything like it, but is the degree to which evidence seems to be coming forward of willfulness. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=125.68s)]
*  I'm particularly struck, for example, by the reporting that one of the Trump lawyers signed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=131.36s)]
*  an affidavit saying that they had turned over all the classified documents when plainly from the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=137.12s)]
*  search inventory, that wasn't true. Now, was that not true because the lawyer was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  deliberately misleading people or was it not true because his client had deliberately misled him? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=148.0s)]
*  I'm sure the Justice Department is trying to find out. From the Intel Committee perspective, though, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=153.6s)]
*  we're just really frightened of what's in that stockpile, particularly those that are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  marked top secret SCI, sensitive compartmented information, because those generally mean that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=163.36s)]
*  there's a very sensitive source involved, might be a human source whose life could be put at risk, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=168.96s)]
*  or a technical source that if it's discovered means we're going to have a blind spot where [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=174.08s)]
*  we used to be able to see. So we're deeply concerned about all of this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCihJdq83eA&t=178.96s)]
