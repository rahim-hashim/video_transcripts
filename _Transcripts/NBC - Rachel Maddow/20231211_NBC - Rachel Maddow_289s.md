Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at the historically poor performance by the current U.S. congress and notes that while some of its figures may seem clownish and the overall disorder may seem laughable, Congress as an institution is vitally necessary to American democracy, and its degradation by the Republican majority feeds the autocratic slide that would leave decision-making to a single strongman.

# Maddow slams ‘pitiful’ Congress and historically weak output of vital institution
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y)
*  You guys, we are almost the best ever. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  We almost have the record. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=4.2s)]
*  The record, the all-time American record [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=7.84s)]
*  for the least productive year in Congress, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=11.34s)]
*  in the history of the Congress, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=14.74s)]
*  is from when Herbert Hoover was president, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=16.78s)]
*  the last year of his presidency, 1931 to 1932. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  America was in the throes of the Great Depression. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=22.16s)]
*  At that point, the unemployment rate was still climbing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=25.32s)]
*  from horrific to even more horrific. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=28.06s)]
*  That Congress, from March 1931 to March 1932, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=30.66s)]
*  passed a grand total of 21 bills [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=35.42s)]
*  that were signed into law over the course of the whole year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=38.56s)]
*  That's the lowest of any year in Congress ever. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=40.7s)]
*  And that year, Congress actually waited nine months [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  before ever convening a single session in Washington. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=47.5s)]
*  They basically took the first nine months of the year off. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=50.5s)]
*  So all 21 of the bills that Congress passed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=53.78s)]
*  that entire year were passed in just the last three months. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  And that is the record, the nadir, the all-time low [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=59.24s)]
*  in terms of Congressional history, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=63.08s)]
*  just 21 laws passed in a whole year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=64.52s)]
*  That's the record. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=69.12s)]
*  We're so close. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=70.58s)]
*  This week officially marks the end [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=72.16s)]
*  of this Congress's first full year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=74.28s)]
*  The number of bills passed by this Congress [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=77.1s)]
*  and signed into law so far is 22. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=79.36s)]
*  We're so close, you guys. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  This Congress has managed to just barely beat [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=87.08s)]
*  the absolute worst record set by any Congress in history, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  a Congress which, again, only met [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=94.36s)]
*  for three months of that year. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=96.16s)]
*  We are almost as bad as it gets, so close. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=98.5s)]
*  They've passed 22 laws total. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=102.44s)]
*  One of them was to establish a new commemorative coin, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=105.3s)]
*  and two of them were to rename medical clinics. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  That said, this Congress has set some records of its own. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  This is the first Congress to have a Speaker of the House [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=117.08s)]
*  ousted by members of his own party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=119.72s)]
*  This Congress has also passed more censure resolutions [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=122.02s)]
*  than any Congress since 1870. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=125.22s)]
*  They have censured more of their own members [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=127.72s)]
*  than any Congress since the invention of the light bulb. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=130.14s)]
*  That's something. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=135.0s)]
*  Now to top off this remarkable year, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=136.64s)]
*  Republicans are looking to close things out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=138.6s)]
*  by voting to open a new impeachment inquiry [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=140.72s)]
*  into President Biden, despite the fact [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  that Republicans have yet to find anything [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=145.66s)]
*  to actually impeach President Biden for. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  They're just gonna kinda open-ended impeach him [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=151.16s)]
*  and hope something emerges while they're voting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  What Republicans have done to this Congress, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=158.33999999999997s)]
*  on the one level, is hilarious. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=161.48s)]
*  But on another level, it is a little bit disturbing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  If you could step back from it, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=167.48s)]
*  if you'd like, the schadenfreude, if you just... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=169.5s)]
*  I mean, at a more serious level, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=174.38s)]
*  when a democracy starts sliding [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=176.44s)]
*  into an authoritarian form of government, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=178.14s)]
*  one of the things you see is the erosion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=180.33999999999997s)]
*  of all government power, all government authority, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=183.88s)]
*  other than, you know, Il Duce, other than the leader, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=186.98s)]
*  other than the executive. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  So the legal system, the judiciary, comes under attack [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  or gets undercut or weakened or closed down or co-opted. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=194.72s)]
*  You see that happen to the judiciary. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=199.64s)]
*  You also see it happen to the legislature, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=201.18s)]
*  Because in an authoritarian system, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=203.92s)]
*  you can't have a parliament or a Congress, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=205.62s)]
*  a legislature that has any real authority [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=208.42s)]
*  that could compete with the authority of the dear leader. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=211.72s)]
*  That's the whole idea of the authoritarian system, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=214.38s)]
*  Unified authority in one person, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=216.8s)]
*  and that person is effectively the government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=220.06s)]
*  There's a reason nobody ever talks about, like, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=223.6s)]
*  what bills are being passed in the Russian legislature, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=225.44s)]
*  right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=228.44s)]
*  Nobody's hanging on what happens in the Duma anymore [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=229.34s)]
*  because it's essentially been domesticated, weakened, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=231.2s)]
*  and rendered irrelevant by the fact [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=234.94s)]
*  that they have a dictatorship. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=237.48s)]
*  It matters whether or not you have branches of government. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Abrogating the authority and responsibilities [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=242.48s)]
*  of a branch of government is not just dumb and pitiful [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  and sometimes inadvertently funny. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=248.2s)]
*  It is also sometimes an important part [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=250.16s)]
*  of losing your democracy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=251.82s)]
*  It is part of the anti-democratic authoritarian project. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=253.84s)]
*  This Congress is pitiful. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=257.1s)]
*  We also need America to have a Congress. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=259.56s)]
*  This Congress still has one more year left. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Perhaps they will decide to try to make it count. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=265.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx0qV07g0Y&t=287.1s)]
