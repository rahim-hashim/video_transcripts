Video Description: As lawyer fees and legal judgments stack up against Donald Trump there is concern that his already weak ethical standards will be overcome by financial desperation and a willingness to entertain the assistance of unsavory people and world powers whose interests are contradictory to those of the United States. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, professor of history at New York University, talks with Rachel Maddow about how Trump's self-serving personality would deal with his money problems.

# Concerns grow that legal losses could make Trump desperate, even more open to corruption
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM)
*  On Friday, a New York judge ordered Trump himself to pay more than $450 million, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=0.0s)]
*  interest, in a civil fraud case involving his real estate businesses. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=6.3s)]
*  But don't worry if that sounds like a lot of money. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=10.46s)]
*  A new GoFundMe campaign has raised half a million dollars already to help the former [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=13.0s)]
*  president toward that end. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=17.66s)]
*  More than $27 million in Trump campaign fundraising went to his legal fees just in the last half [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  of last year alone. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=25.52s)]
*  Now that Trump's working to put his own people in charge of the National Republican Party, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=27.36s)]
*  some senior Republicans are saying they're worried he'll end up tapping Republican party [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=31.68s)]
*  coffers as well. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=35.28s)]
*  The prospect keeping many people up at night, though, is the idea that it will be a foreign [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=37.68s)]
*  government, some sort of foreign entity, perhaps even a hostile one, that could decide they'll [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=42.0s)]
*  just cover it all. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=46.82s)]
*  How would that fit with Trump's announced plans for a second term and for his strongman [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=49.6s)]
*  style of promised governance? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=54.32s)]
*  Our next guest studies the relationship between corruption and foreign influence being openly [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=57.08s)]
*  bought between those perils and the idea of authoritarian governance. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=61.28s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott is a professor of history at NYU. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=65.88s)]
*  She's the author of an essential book on authoritarianism called Strongmen, from Mussolini to the present. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=68.28s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott, it's really a pleasure to have you here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=75.4s)]
*  Thanks very much for joining us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=77.24s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=79.12s)]
*  The prospect of massive foreign support for a president who's in serious financial trouble [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=81.96s)]
*  feels like a very singular thing that we've never faced before in the United States. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=89.08s)]
*  But the way you write about money and corruption and its relation to authoritarianism in your [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  book makes me think that this is not something necessarily that should be seen in isolation [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=99.96s)]
*  to Trump here, but maybe should be seen as more a larger part of the authoritarian project. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=105.32s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=111.96s)]
*  Trump is what we call a personalist ruler, meaning he personalizes politics. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  And holding public office or running for office in this case, the goal of it is and the party [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=119.52s)]
*  and government agencies, they're supposed to solve the leaders personal, legal and financial [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=126.55999999999999s)]
*  problems. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=132.48s)]
*  So holding office is a mechanism of self-enrichment. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=133.48s)]
*  And so is running a campaign in this case. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=137.84s)]
*  And Trump in that sense is very similar to other authoritarians. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=141.72s)]
*  And it's most extreme, like in Putin's Russia, you have kleptocracy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  But what we have here is a party mechanism, as Lara Trump is saying, that every penny [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=152.4s)]
*  has to go of the RNC and donors to electing Trump and solving his financial problems. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=157.4s)]
*  Sadly and disgracefully, the RNC was already doing this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=166.6s)]
*  It's incredible, Rachel, that a whole year after the election, the 2020 election, the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=169.84s)]
*  RNC was paying Trump's personal legal bills. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=175.04s)]
*  And so this is an example of the personalization of power where there's no division or recognition [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=180.28s)]
*  of the difference between public and private. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=187.56s)]
*  When Trump says openly that he received millions from the Chinese to his businesses while he [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=190.52s)]
*  was president for, quote, services, and he says this openly, he's telling you that he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=197.8s)]
*  embraces that conception of power. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  Does it have to work only on his supporters so that they will give him their own money? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=207.44s)]
*  Or does it also have to work in such a way that, as you say, even foreign money, even [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  obviously corrupting foreign influence, funneled as money to the leader personally, has to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=220.4s)]
*  be made into a political virtue as well? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=226.28s)]
*  Yes, yes, it has to be both. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=231.72s)]
*  And the key here is the Republican Party that is a linchpin of this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=233.92s)]
*  It is a willing accomplice to Trump's financial corruption. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=239.64s)]
*  And it was OK with him hiring his family, Jared Kushner, in power, and is not doing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=245.84s)]
*  anything to stand up for the division between personal and political. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=257.4s)]
*  And the real struggle indeed is embracing this kind of authoritarian leader cult where [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump can do whatever he says and says that Putin can do whatever he says as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=270.32s)]
*  So it can be hard for Americans to understand because it's a completely proprietary vision [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=275.92s)]
*  of power, that everything is for your taking. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=281.88s)]
*  Everything is yours. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=285.52s)]
*  There's a kind of megalomania. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=286.88s)]
*  I think it's OK to say that the Chinese gave my businesses millions of dollars for, quote, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=289.6s)]
*  services. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  Most people who are Democrats would not say such things. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  But for Trump, it's a boast. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=307.16s)]
*  And this is why he admires Xi Jinping and Putin, because they get away with things like [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=309.0s)]
*  that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=314.04s)]
*  It's been very open, the corruption. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=315.04s)]
*  And corruption is institutionalized. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=316.92s)]
*  And that's what he would like America to be like if he comes back to the White House. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44JrWvf5XFM&t=318.68s)]
