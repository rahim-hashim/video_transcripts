# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4)
*  The first one was big, maybe not insurmountably big. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=0.0s)]
*  With help from the Federal Insurance Company, which is a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=3.6s)]
*  former President Donald Trump managed to post a $91.6 million bond in the defamation case [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=8.88s)]
*  he lost to E. Jean Carroll. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=15.0s)]
*  That bond allows Trump to avoid paying E. Jean Carroll for real while he attempts to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=16.88s)]
*  appeal that judgment against him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=21.98s)]
*  If he were to lose the appeal and not pay up, the Federal Insurance Company and Chubb [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=24.52s)]
*  would be on the hook to pay Ms. Carroll. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=29.0s)]
*  That has given the company's investors and brokers and some of their customers apparently [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=32.12s)]
*  a little bit of heartburn judging from a letter the CEO of Chubb sent around defending the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=35.64s)]
*  decision saying, quote, as the surety, we don't take sides. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=40.92s)]
*  We are supporting and are part of the justice system plumbing included in this case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=44.58s)]
*  In other words, we're just that trap thing at the bottom of the sink. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=51.56s)]
*  We are not the stuff that got stuck in it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  Don't get mad at us for just doing our jobs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=58.1s)]
*  But if a $91.6 million bond was a doable one for the former president, a $454 million bond [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=60.96s)]
*  and counting is proving to be another matter entirely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=68.9s)]
*  Lawyers for Mr. Trump today told a New York appellate court that he can't find a company [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=72.5s)]
*  to help him with a nearly half billion dollar bond while he appeals the New York civil fraud [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  case involving his business. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=83.66s)]
*  According to the filing, more than two dozen companies, including Chubb, have decided on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=86.06s)]
*  that bond that they cannot do it and they will not do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=90.26s)]
*  That leaves Trump in a very vulnerable position for somebody who brags about his personal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=93.7s)]
*  wealth as much as he does, who's key to his political appeal is that he can't be bought [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=98.7s)]
*  because he has so much money than everybody else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=104.34s)]
*  In this case, what he has more than anybody else is a need for money quickly and desperately. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=106.9s)]
*  New York Attorney General Tish James has said that she is ready and willing to start seizing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=113.26s)]
*  Trump's properties in order to satisfy the judgment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=118.14s)]
*  The clock is ticking. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  The former president may have to put up more than the half billion dollar bond that's giving [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  him trouble already. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=126.22s)]
*  As the New York Times puts it today, quote, Trump might have to post an appeal bond worth [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=127.22s)]
*  more, possibly above a half billion dollars to reflect the interest he'll owe in order [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  to prevent Ms. James from seizing his assets on March 25th. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=136.46s)]
*  And I mean March 25th this year, as in one week from tonight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=142.9s)]
*  Joining us now, Suzanne Craig, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter for the New [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=149.22s)]
*  York Times. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  Sue, it's really good to have you here in person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  You too. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  We have seen Mr. Trump put up one bond already and now we are seeing him saying he can't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  put up the second one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  Did we learn anything from the circumstances around which he put up that first bond that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=163.46s)]
*  tell us if he's getting help, that tell us how many of his assets have been tapped already, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=170.7s)]
*  that tell us whether or not he really might be having trouble with the second one? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=177.54s)]
*  What really came into focus for me today when I was reading this was that there's been a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=181.5s)]
*  lot of speculation he's going to put up a building. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  What are they going to accept for this appeal bond? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  I think we're all learning a lot about appeal bonds as we go. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=191.57999999999998s)]
*  And what we really saw today was that they want hard cash. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  They are not accepting assets. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=197.78s)]
*  Alan Garten, who's a senior officer, is a lawyer at the Trump Organization. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=200.22s)]
*  He said that they tried and with Chubb in particular, none of them wanted real estate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=204.38s)]
*  These aren't real estate companies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  They want things they can liquidate immediately. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=210.58s)]
*  They want cash. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=212.82s)]
*  And they talked to Chubb about doing this larger one that he's facing a week from today [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=214.22s)]
*  and Chubb last week backed away and they're not going to take real estate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=218.78s)]
*  So now we know for certain that he needs to come up with cash and he does not have enough [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=222.62s)]
*  cash according to the filings today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=227.34s)]
*  So can he, I mean, what are his options? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=230.06s)]
*  Can he sell things that he currently owns, liquidate assets, liquidate real estate assets [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=232.66s)]
*  or other assets in order to convert them into cash since that's the only thing he can pay [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=238.06s)]
*  with here? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=241.9s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=242.9s)]
*  And it's going to have to be like today. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=243.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=245.66s)]
*  Like soon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=246.66s)]
*  He's going to have to figure and he may have, we don't know. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=247.66s)]
*  He may be already in the process of potentially negotiating a sale. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=249.22s)]
*  He may have gotten a deal with somebody that he knows. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=253.18s)]
*  And we don't know if that's in progress or not. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=256.26000000000005s)]
*  These are just sort of things that I'm speculating on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=259.38000000000005s)]
*  It's important to say that, but that could be going on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  But what we do know is that the filing today was sort of, you know, they're raising their [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=265.70000000000005s)]
*  hands saying they don't have the cash to meet this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=270.1s)]
*  So they want it stayed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=273.48s)]
*  And I think the other thing that's really important here is this is a legal maneuver [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  because they're asking a judge to set this aside. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  And if it's rejected, they may go to the appellate court. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=283.26s)]
*  So they may buy themselves some times. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  And the attorney general also has the option of saying you can have another 30 days. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=287.82s)]
*  If they were to come and say, we have a plan, there's a lot of things. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=291.78s)]
*  We just never have seen anything like this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=296.86s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that could happen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=298.58s)]
*  But right now he is looking down the barrel of a gun. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=301.5s)]
*  I mean, you can hear the clock. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  He has got one week. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=306.46s)]
*  And if nothing changes, the attorney general of New York can come in. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  Seize his accounts, seize his buildings, seize his materials. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=312.46s)]
*  So the thing that I am worried about now that I didn't think I would be worried about when [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=317.06s)]
*  this whole process started is that I'm worried that he is in such a crunch. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=322.41999999999996s)]
*  And I'm worried what that means in terms of a national security threat for the United [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=326.82s)]
*  States. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=329.7s)]
*  Is there anything about the process of putting up bonds that prevents some angel from coming [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  in and paying it for him? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=338.7s)]
*  And if that happened, would we know? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, that can happen. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=342.38s)]
*  And if that happens, there's going to be tax consequences for the person who gives it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=343.98s)]
*  Because it's a gift? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=347.66s)]
*  It's a taxable event. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=348.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=350.66s)]
*  So but you know, and I've sort of been wondering how much transparency are we going to have [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=351.66s)]
*  in it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  We do know with the E. Jean Carroll case, the bond was posted and he posted his collateral [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  and some filings, a brokerage account that he has that has liquid securities in it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=360.3s)]
*  So there's some visibility. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=366.94s)]
*  And keep in mind, there's also a monitor over the company that is going to be watching this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  So I suspect at the end, we're going to know. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=372.74s)]
*  I never want to say never with anything. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=375.22s)]
*  But right now, I feel like we should know at least who comes forward with it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=377.5s)]
*  But that's another possibility is someone could come up with the money and write a check [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=381.86s)]
*  to cover it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  He also has other wealthy family members, Ivanka Trump and her husband come to mind. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  So there's still, I think, a range of possibilities, I think, over them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=392.62s)]
*  And they're exploring them all, I can guarantee it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=396.3s)]
*  They have to be. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=398.3s)]
*  So I think that next week, I think we're just going to have a lot more visibility and exactly [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  how this is going to be dealt with. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=403.3s)]
*  But we could be faced in a week with a situation where the attorney general says the day has [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=404.66s)]
*  come and I'm going to appeal to the court when we're going to move forward to seize [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=409.90000000000003s)]
*  the assets. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=413.3s)]
*  He recently changed his position on the culture war issue around Bud Light after Anheuser [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  Bush did a fundraiser for him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=419.62s)]
*  He then changed his position on TikTok and the Chinese government after he met with a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=421.62s)]
*  guy who has a big financial stake in TikTok. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=425.3s)]
*  He now needs a half billion dollars right now. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  He has to pay it on Monday. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=430.54s)]
*  And so I'm just worried about what's for sale. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=431.54s)]
*  I hope you're right. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=435.1s)]
*  There will be some transparency about it, Susan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=437.38s)]
*  Before he died suddenly in a Russian prison last month, opposition leader Alexei Navalny [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=439.62s)]
*  had urged his supporters, had urged people who opposed Vladimir Putin, had urged them [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=444.5s)]
*  to turn up at the polls this past weekend for the Russian presidential election, even [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=449.18s)]
*  though the outcome of that election is a foregone conclusion. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  Protesting may be illegal in Russia. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=457.42s)]
*  Being an actual opposition figure to Vladimir Putin may be illegal, may be fatally illegal [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=460.14s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=465.66s)]
*  But Putin does still like to make it look like the country still has elections. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=467.38s)]
*  So Navalny said basically, take advantage of that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=470.94s)]
*  Show up to vote all at once. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=474.14s)]
*  Everybody show up at noon on Sunday specifically. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=476.1s)]
*  And that will be the way we register our opposition to the Putin regime. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=479.3s)]
*  And this Sunday, yesterday, people did it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=483.14s)]
*  Polling places that moments before had been empty. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  Suddenly at noon yesterday had lines down the block. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=489.22s)]
*  Those lines in Russia were inspiring, impressive in terms of what people are willing to do, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=494.46000000000004s)]
*  the risks people are willing to take to show their independence, to show their opposition. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  But of course, it was ultimately futile that Russia even held a vote this weekend is a farce. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=508.5s)]
*  Everybody knew the outcome the moment Putin announced he would run for a fifth term. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=513.9399999999999s)]
*  He's president for life. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=519.54s)]
*  This is the way it goes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=520.74s)]
*  It's an autocracy that pretends it is still a democracy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. You make it look like there's an election, but there's no suspense because they don't [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=525.42s)]
*  really let anybody run against you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  And the vote itself does not matter. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=530.4599999999999s)]
*  The results of the election have nothing to do with the actual preference and actual behavior [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=532.26s)]
*  of the voters. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=535.8199999999999s)]
*  When you start doing that, when you start turning elections into these Potemkin affairs, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=537.6999999999999s)]
*  it doesn't really matter if you've done anything formal to to announce or mark your [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=542.6600000000001s)]
*  transition into something other than a democracy. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=548.86s)]
*  Once you have a situation where the vote in advance is determined to be irrelevant, so [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=551.62s)]
*  that whatever happens, whatever the voters do, there's only one possible result. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=555.98s)]
*  Once you have that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=559.7s)]
*  You're kind of there, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=562.38s)]
*  You are no longer in a real democracy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=563.5s)]
*  You may remember that after Election Day in 2020, when Joe Biden had decisively won the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=566.82s)]
*  state of Michigan by over one hundred and fifty thousand votes, you might remember two [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=571.74s)]
*  Republican officials briefly refused to certify those election results in largely [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=575.7s)]
*  Democratic counties. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=581.78s)]
*  Then Republicans in one county in Georgia, another state Joe Biden won. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=583.94s)]
*  They also refused to certify election results in part of that state as well. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=588.02s)]
*  That county's refusal to certify the results was used as evidence in a draft executive [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=593.5s)]
*  order Trump never issued, an order that would have commanded the seizing of voting machines [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=598.46s)]
*  across the country as a prelude to the military running some sort of redo of the whole [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  election because something had gone wrong the first time around, and it appeared that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=608.58s)]
*  Trump didn't win. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=612.58s)]
*  Those local attempts at invalidating election results in 2020, those were effectively [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=615.4200000000001s)]
*  improvised responses to Trump losing that election. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=621.5s)]
*  This next time around in 2024, elections officials, Republican election officials seem [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=625.46s)]
*  like they are more planning it out in advance this time. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=632.66s)]
*  This is the headline on new reporting published today in Rolling Stone, quote, potential [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=636.8199999999999s)]

*  the outcome of the November election. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  Local Republican elections officials in some of these cases over the last few years have [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=673.62s)]
*  demanded audits and hand recounts. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=677.46s)]
*  And then even when all the audits and recounts show the same results, they still refuse to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=681.06s)]
*  certify the election because it's not about what the voters have actually voted for. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=685.14s)]
*  It's about setting up a system that can deliver only one possible result. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=690.34s)]
*  This is the way it works in many parts of the world. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=696.18s)]

*  They're trying to change that. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=704.8199999999999s)]

*  Stay with us. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=708.42s)]
*  At Rolling Stone today, reporter Justin Glah reports on election officials across the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=709.14s)]
*  country in Republican controlled states and counties who since the 2020 election have [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=714.18s)]
*  refused to certify election results. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=720.9s)]
*  They have demanded things like hand recounts. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=723.06s)]
*  They have demanded that results simply not be certified. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=725.3s)]
*  Glah describes it as what appears to be a sort of constellation of local events, but [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=728.5s)]
*  ones that pose a potential real challenge for 2024 heading into what is certainly going [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=734.9s)]
*  to be a contested election in the presidential race and potentially other levels. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=739.62s)]
*  Also troubling because it appears that some of these what appear to be separate and discordant [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=744.98s)]
*  efforts may be linked at least by perpetrators of these events who are taking funding from [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=749.54s)]
*  the same sorts of people attending the same sorts of conferences and ascribing themselves [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=756.74s)]
*  to the same conspiracy theories about elections being fraudulent. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=760.82s)]
*  Joining us now is Justin Glah who's reported this piece for Rolling Stone. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=764.98s)]
*  He's also the author of American Doom, which is a newsletter on Substack. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=768.26s)]
*  Mr. Glah, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=771.86s)]
*  Thanks very much for your time. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=773.3s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=775.14s)]
*  So how much commonality is between the different types of instances that you found, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=776.5s)]
*  15 different instances you reported since 2020 in which [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=782.0999999999999s)]
*  local Republican officials have refused to certify election results? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=785.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, the commonality is that they're not based in reality. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=791.06s)]
*  They're carried out by people who believe lies and conspiracy theories about why it's [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=794.74s)]
*  for an election fraud that just doesn't exist. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=799.38s)]
*  In terms of where this is coming from, is it a centrally organized effort? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=802.02s)]
*  You did describe some sort of links and sort of network patterns between these groups. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=808.9000000000001s)]
*  They seem to, in some cases, be funded by the same sorts of entities and attending the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=813.14s)]
*  same sorts of conferences, of subscribing to the same sorts of sources of information. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  But are they effectively working together to try to seed doubts about 2024? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=821.5400000000001s)]
*  Only in that they are reading and absorbing the same type of materials about election fraud and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=828.34s)]
*  conspiracies as a lot of other Americans are. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=835.86s)]
*  Sort of like decentralized coordination, I guess, where they're involved in these networks, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=840.1800000000001s)]
*  they're reading this stuff, they're listening to what Trump says about it, and they're believing it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  One of the experts that you cite in your piece from the Brennan Center says, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=850.98s)]
*  part of the strategy is to create chaos and to create a false basis [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=855.0600000000001s)]
*  for trying to find some way to challenge the outcome. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=858.9s)]
*  Is part of the idea here, part of the threat here, that you can create smoke for any number of reasons [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=861.94s)]
*  that aren't, as you say, based in reality, but if you create enough smoke, you can convince people [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  that there is a fire. You can use disparate false claims of irregularities to create a sense that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=875.0600000000001s)]
*  there must be something wrong, otherwise I wouldn't be hearing about all of these local controversies. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=882.5s)]
*  I think that's definitely the case, and I think you can look to that never issued executive order [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=887.46s)]
*  that you talked about earlier about seizing voting machines, where they mentioned one of these [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=892.98s)]
*  instances of refusing to certify as evidence of the sort of phenomenon of creating smoke and then [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=897.5400000000001s)]
*  saying that there's a fire. And, you know, so they did that last time around and said, well, they [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=903.86s)]
*  refused to certify in Coffee County, therefore there's fraud. Let's seize the voting machines. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=912.34s)]

*  This past weekend, Putin met with the handpicked pro-Kremlin leader of part of Moldova that Putin [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=938.02s)]
*  wants to break off from that country to make it part of Russia. Just like he's been breaking off [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=945.62s)]
*  pieces of Ukraine and taking those pieces for himself and forcing those parts of Ukraine to be [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=950.1s)]
*  part of Russia now, he also appears to have designs on parts of Moldova to do the same thing to them. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=954.26s)]
*  When Putin brought this pro-Kremlin leader of a breakaway part of Moldova, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=961.7s)]
*  Moldova over to Moscow to meet with him, the president of Moldova got so alarmed by Putin [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=967.0600000000001s)]
*  taking that meeting, by what Putin said about how Russia might need to go in and take care of things [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=973.38s)]
*  in Moldova sometime soon the way it has in Ukraine. She was so alarmed by that, that she flew in person [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=978.4200000000001s)]
*  to the first European NATO country that would agree to form a defense agreement with her country. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=985.62s)]
*  The president of Moldova flew to France, signed a new agreement with France where France hereby [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  agrees to come to the aid of Moldova if indeed Putin attacks there too, just like he attacked Ukraine. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=996.26s)]
*  Poland's building bomb shelters, Moldova is forming new defense alliances as Putin is threatening to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1004.26s)]
*  invade Moldova too. Now a third one, the nation of Georgia, Reuters reporting this weekend that in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1010.02s)]
*  the nation of Georgia, which doesn't border Ukraine, it borders Russia directly, another one of these [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1015.78s)]
*  hand-picked pro-Kremlin officials from part of that country that Putin wants to break off and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1022.82s)]
*  make it part of Russia instead, that local leader in Georgia has quote, discussed its possible [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1027.6200000000001s)]
*  inclusion into Russia with Moscow according to Russian state media. So he brings over a [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1035.22s)]
*  pro-Kremlin hand-picked leader from part of Georgia that Russia wants to break off from Georgia and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1042.66s)]
*  make it part of their own country. So Putin has invaded Ukraine, he's in the third year of his war [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1048.58s)]
*  in Ukraine, he's threatening two more countries on his border, another country that's bordering [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1055.62s)]
*  Ukraine is threatened enough by how he's behaving toward them that they're building bomb shelters [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1060.4199999999998s)]
*  for civilians in their capital city. Just a few days ago in a fourth country in the same neighborhood [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1064.82s)]
*  in Lithuania which borders both Poland and Russia, we had a vicious hammer attack, what appears to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1070.82s)]
*  have been an attempted murder, broke the guy's arms, smashed him up, a hammer attack on an ally [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1079.46s)]
*  of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Alexei Navalny was of course himself recently assassinated [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1086.5s)]
*  in a Russian prison. So you put all this together and what you're talking about here is a [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1091.9399999999998s)]
*  geopolitical wrecking ball. This isn't one war, this isn't a country with a border dispute, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1096.9s)]
*  right? What Putin is making happen in the world right now is constant war and destabilization [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1105.38s)]
*  and threats and terroristic violence and assassinations in multiple bordering countries [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1112.9s)]
*  and pushing right into NATO. And of course when he pushes into NATO that directly implicates us. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1118.5s)]
*  Putin was asked ahead of this weekend's Potemkin election in Russia about whether he wants to [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1124.02s)]
*  engage in peace talks with Ukraine since that war is now in its third year. Putin scoffed at that, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1130.58s)]
*  he said why should he bother doing that just because Ukraine is running out of ammunition now? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1136.74s)]
*  And indeed Ukraine is running out of ammunition now and that's largely because of us. It's because [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1143.22s)]
*  of the Republican Party at least in the United States of America. Since pro-Trump heartliners [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1149.62s)]
*  installed a new Trumpier Republican speaker of the House, American aid to Ukraine has stopped. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1156.1799999999998s)]
*  And so yes, Ukraine is running out of ammunition to fight Russia. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1162.74s)]
*  So why would Russia stop and hold peace talks or anything else right now? Putin can see how this [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1167.86s)]
*  is going to end as long as the Republicans in the United States of America keep doing their part to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1174.1s)]
*  help. Geopolitical wrecking ball with apparently limitless ambitions. It's one thing to start the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1178.98s)]
*  largest land war in Europe since World War II, it's another thing to be three years into that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1189.06s)]
*  and starting to rattle your saber at multiple other countries on your own borders and the borders [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1195.54s)]
*  of the country you have already invaded. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1201.38s)]
*  you [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0a4T8B1Rf4&t=1208.98s)]
