# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 16
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k)
*  There were a lot of headlines earlier today about progress being made in peace talks between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine, with even Russia's foreign minister saying today that there was some [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=4.88s)]
*  hope of a breakthrough in talks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=9.52s)]
*  But Russia's leader had some different thoughts. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=11.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin struck a defiant and dark tone, saying that his, quote, special operation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=14.84s)]
*  was developing successfully in strict accordance with pre-approved plans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=20.52s)]
*  He claimed that the invasion was a fight for Russia's sovereignty and said the West is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=26.88s)]
*  trying to split Russia into parts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=31.64s)]
*  The authoritarian leader wanted to make sure he was clear, quote, we will never allow Ukraine [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  to become a stronghold of aggressive actions against our country, end quote. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=40.2s)]
*  But he also delivered the starkest threats to Russians who oppose him and his so-called [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=45.42s)]
*  spell it the special military operation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=51.28s)]
*  Putin said, quote, the Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=54.16s)]
*  from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=58.72s)]
*  their mouths. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=65.84s)]
*  I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  our country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  Those startling comments come after the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=76.92s)]
*  hearing yesterday on combating authoritarianism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  The committee called the Pulitzer Prize winning historian Anne Applebaum, an expert on authoritarianism, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=83.84s)]
*  to testify. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=88.84s)]
*  She said the US needs to do more to combat Russia's authoritarian leader. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=89.92s)]
*  Western sanctions alone have no impact on autocrats who know they can continue to trade [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=96.92s)]
*  with one another. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  Accusations from human rights organizations mean nothing to dictators. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=102.4s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine in part because the Russian president believed he would pay no [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=106.04s)]
*  price. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  We have always reacting to the latest outrage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=111.08s)]
*  We need to change the rules of the game altogether. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=113.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Anne Applebaum. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=118.72s)]
*  She's a Pulitzer Prize winning historian, a staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=120.16s)]
*  Ms. Applebaum, thank you for being with us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  I want to ask you, when you say we've got to change the rules of the game, that we have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  to stop being reactive, in this context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, how would [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=130.32s)]
*  you have seen it going differently and how in the middle of the game do you change? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=136.0s)]
*  So there's the famous Irish joke about, you know, if you want to get to Dunleary, you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=142.12s)]
*  don't start from here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=148.44s)]
*  And so, yes, I wouldn't have started from here, from where we are. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=149.9s)]
*  I would have pushed back against not just Russian kleptocracy but international kleptocracy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=154.0s)]
*  many years ago. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=159.2s)]
*  We could have changed our laws in order to make it impossible to buy and sell property [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=161.8s)]
*  anonymously in our country and in other countries. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=166.8s)]
*  We could have thought differently about how we communicate to Russians and to others. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=169.8s)]
*  In the middle of the war, it's a much more difficult prospect, although I do hope that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=174.9s)]
*  this war is going to give us some ideas for how to proceed in future. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=179.0s)]
*  In the middle of the war, what I think we need to do is change our thinking. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  I feel that's maybe beginning to happen in Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  We need to begin to think not just about damage limitation or about how to grind down the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  Russians slowly, but about how we're going to help Ukraine win. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=197.52s)]
*  And by winning, I mean expel the Russian troops from their country and create some kind of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=202.8s)]
*  stable, long-lasting permanent peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  And that is a very large ask from where we are now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  But if we make that our goal and then we work backwards, which arms do we need to give the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=215.24s)]
*  Ukrainians in order for them to push out the troops? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=219.10000000000002s)]
*  What kind of final settlement will achieve what we want it to achieve? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=222.58s)]
*  We're not looking for a second best outcome. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=226.66000000000003s)]
*  We're looking for the best outcome. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=228.74s)]
*  If we start to think like that, that will help guide us in our policy from now on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  I want to bring into the conversation Marijan Zablotsky, a member of the Ukrainian parliament. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=237.06s)]
*  Mr. Zablotsky, thank you so much for joining us, particularly at this hour. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=241.62s)]
*  It's the middle of the night. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=245.1s)]
*  But I do want to get your reaction to President Biden's announcement after President Zelensky's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=246.78s)]
*  presentation to Congress that he is sending more military aid to Ukraine, more anti-tank [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=251.62s)]
*  aircraft, more anti-aircraft, I'm sorry, more anti-tank weapons and more anti-aircraft weapons, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  more armed drones. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  Is this going to help you? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=265.26s)]
*  This is extremely welcomed and we are extremely grateful to American people, to President [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=267.74s)]
*  Biden, to American taxpayers for supporting us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=274.98s)]
*  We understand that the United States have the wrong problems and $14 billion of aid [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=278.26000000000005s)]
*  to Ukraine still matter a lot in the United States. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  But here they will go the extreme way. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  They will alleviate suffering and this will actually help us fight one of supposedly the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  biggest armies of the world, which is now severely demotivated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=295.82s)]
*  And of course, President Zelensky is right to call to the United States as the only country [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=299.34s)]
*  that can lead the free world and stop for the global rules written down after the World [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=305.7s)]
*  War II from changing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=311.58s)]
*  So after the World War II, everybody thought that changing borders by force is the thing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  of the past. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  Now this crazy man in Kremlin tries to change that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=318.82s)]
*  And we are at the front line of this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=322.05999999999995s)]
*  This has to be stopped now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=323.85999999999996s)]
*  So this is not only the fight about Ukraine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=324.98s)]
*  This is a fight about values. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=327.18s)]
*  And we do ask for the American people and for President Biden to lead that fight. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=329.18s)]
*  What more do you have to say to the world when they say to you, as Cal Perry just reported, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=334.42s)]
*  that you are making that argument, that you're the front line of democracy, you're the front [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  line against Russian imperialism, you're the front line against rules that we all agreed [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=344.74s)]
*  many, many years ago we don't break about changing borders. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  Why do you feel that the West is not completely embracing that and saying this is the war [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=354.94s)]
*  and we need to get into it? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that the West has done quite a lot already. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=361.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's very difficult for me to criticize any country for not doing enough. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=365.5s)]
*  But I just need to say that we need to do the maximum. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=369.38s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=371.78s)]
*  There are a lot of dictators around the world, a lot of countries without democracies. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=372.85999999999996s)]
*  And currently every single one of them is watching what is the cost of actually trying [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=378.53999999999996s)]
*  to challenge the rules. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=383.62s)]
*  What are the costs for invading other country and how will I be punished for that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=384.66s)]
*  There needs to be set a precedent that the costs are all the maximum potential consequences [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=389.86s)]
*  that all the countries can do on their behalf. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=395.66s)]
*  So we cannot return to the pre-World War II world where one country attacked other country [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=398.94s)]
*  and then they try to read some sort of agreement about the changes in territory. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=405.98s)]
*  Because otherwise the world will turn into chaos and we will step right into World War [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=410.34s)]
*  III one way or another. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=416.85999999999996s)]
*  However, there are negotiations that stop and start between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  And negotiations mean a deal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=427.26s)]
*  How do you feel about the idea that Ukraine may end up making some concessions in order [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=430.85999999999996s)]
*  to get peace in the face of an unprovoked invasion of your country? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=435.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's very difficult to understand what will Putin end up agreeing to and what he [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  can agree to. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=446.61999999999995s)]
*  What we understand now that his plan to reach some sort of agreement was nonexistent before [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=447.94s)]
*  the war. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=453.26s)]
*  He was absolutely 100% invested to his idea that he will win the country over the course [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=454.26s)]
*  of days, several weeks. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  And by now in his mind, the country should have already been conquered and there was [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=462.58s)]
*  no one to negotiate with. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=467.05999999999995s)]
*  How soon can he come to a reality that he actually needs to come to a table? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=469.1s)]
*  He should admit that his plans have failed already, that he cannot reach what he wants [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=474.58000000000004s)]
*  with military needs is a debatable question. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=480.06s)]
*  The question is to his mentality and how adequate he is. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=482.66s)]
*  So I just think we will have to wait and see for that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=485.94s)]
*  Let me ask you about the reports, these very disturbing reports about the attacks, the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=491.06s)]
*  continued attacks on civilian infrastructure, including this theater in Mariupol in which [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=495.34000000000003s)]
*  it is believed that there are people taking shelter. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  Do you think this changes the argument? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=503.22s)]
*  Do you think this changes the willingness of the world to get involved in a different [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=505.42s)]
*  way when they continue to see these humanitarian, what might end up being war crimes? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=509.14s)]
*  Of course, and it changes the attitude of Ukrainian people as well. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  What you see on the ground is actually even much worse than what you can see in the video. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=520.62s)]
*  I just returned from Kiev a day ago and I listened to a lot of stories from members of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=526.5s)]
*  parliament who helped people get out from the worst affected areas. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  And when you do hear the stories about how refugees, those people who escaped fighting, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=535.8199999999999s)]
*  are talking about actual violence, the rape, systematic rape, the murder of civilians. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=541.78s)]
*  It's absolutely heartbreaking. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=548.9s)]
*  So it's one thing even in the video that Zelensky presented to watch how people are being [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=550.98s)]
*  and children treated at the hospitals. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=557.5s)]
*  Another thing is to hear the stories of violence and see videos of violence. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=559.34s)]
*  It's actually even much worse than that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=563.9s)]
*  And this is something that Ukrainian nation will never forgive and will never forget for [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=565.62s)]
*  generations to come. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=570.26s)]
*  Today, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, gave an impassioned address in a [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  virtual address to U.S. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=577.14s)]
*  lawmakers. He once again requested a no fly zone over his country and pleaded for more [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=578.54s)]
*  security assistance in its conflict with Russia. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=584.14s)]
*  Now, a no fly zone remains off the table. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=587.26s)]
*  But a few hours later, President Joe Biden authorized a new package of eight hundred [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=589.42s)]
*  million dollars in military aid. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=594.62s)]
*  This is in addition to the two hundred million dollars he approved over the weekend. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=597.18s)]
*  Now, the new aid packages include more of the javelin anti-tank and Stinger [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=601.1s)]
*  anti-aircraft weapons that the Biden administration had previously sent to Ukraine and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=606.38s)]
*  which have been used to great effect against Russian troops. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=610.9000000000001s)]
*  But the administration is also sending a hundred of what it referred to as, quote, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=614.1800000000001s)]
*  tactical unmanned aerial systems. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=619.1400000000001s)]
*  Two congressional officials told NBC News today that those tactical unmanned aerial [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=622.34s)]
*  systems are actually something called switchblade drones, similar to the ones that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=627.38s)]
*  you'd see here. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=632.1s)]
*  They're portable, low cost, single use weapons that can strike enemy targets from [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=634.1s)]
*  miles away and fly much faster than the Turkish drones that Ukraine has been using to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=639.5s)]
*  date. These U.S. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=644.9s)]
*  switchblade drones are also small enough that they cannot be detected by most air [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=646.46s)]
*  defense systems. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=651.78s)]
*  For almost two weeks now, the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders has been sounding [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=653.02s)]
*  the alarm that the port city of Mariupol in the southeastern corner of Ukraine is in [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=657.9s)]
*  particularly dire straits. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=662.78s)]
*  They warned then that many were lacking basic needs like running water. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=664.62s)]
*  And since then, things have only gotten worse. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=668.78s)]
*  This is a phone call between Doctors Without Borders and one of their staff members in [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=671.46s)]
*  Mariupol from this past Saturday, March 12th. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=675.86s)]
*  People lost connection with their relatives. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  They don't know what is happening with their relatives in other districts of Mariupol. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=681.22s)]
*  And it's already lasting for more than one week. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  And people are really very worried about their relatives. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=690.5400000000001s)]
*  They don't know if they're alive or they already maybe not alive. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=693.5400000000001s)]
*  We saw people who died because of lack of medication. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=700.7s)]
*  And there are a lot of people inside Mariupol and many people who were killed and injured. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=705.38s)]
*  And they're just lying on the ground and neighbors just digging the hole in the ground. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=711.98s)]
*  And that body is inside. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=719.98s)]
*  That was Saturday. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  Today, that already terrible situation escalated dramatically. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=726.06s)]
*  Mariupol City Council said today that a power outage in the city of Mariupol is a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=730.06s)]
*  terrible thing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=733.86s)]
*  And the city council said today that a powerful Russian bomb hit this building, a theater [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=734.86s)]
*  where city council believes hundreds of civilians were sheltering. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=739.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, city officials could not immediately assess how many people have been killed or [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=742.82s)]
*  injured because the entrance to the bomb shelter has been blocked by rubble. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=746.2600000000001s)]
*  So what does this mean for the already precarious medical situation on the ground in Mariupol? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=750.34s)]
*  And what does medical care look like in all of Ukraine right now? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=755.2600000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Alex Wade. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=759.06s)]
*  He's an emergency coordinator with Doctors Without Borders. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=761.06s)]
*  He spent the last few weeks traveling all over Ukraine, from Lviv in the West to the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=764.06s)]
*  central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=768.86s)]
*  And that's where he joins us from tonight. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=770.42s)]
*  Alex, thanks very much for joining us this evening. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=772.1s)]
*  I know you and the world are particularly concerned right now about the city of Mariupol. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=775.06s)]
*  Prior to today's news about the bombing at a theater there that was being used as a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=779.54s)]
*  as a shelter, what made Mariupol's situation worse than other cities? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=784.82s)]
*  For what? Us, one of the most concerning things is that we've been completely cut off [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  from being able to access Mariupol. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=795.5s)]
*  So we also lost communications with the hospitals there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  We had been in contact with who we had been donating supplies to. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=800.26s)]
*  The last communication we had was that they were receiving an increased amount of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=804.62s)]
*  wounded and they were worried about running out of supplies because the supply, the medical [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=810.38s)]
*  supply chain in the entire country has been disrupted due to this war. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=814.38s)]
*  And so we were worried about the situation in the hospitals. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=818.6600000000001s)]
*  But for us also, we have we have staff, colleagues of ours who work for MSF, who are [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=821.1800000000001s)]
*  there in Mariupol, who've been reporting to us the conditions, and they are truly [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=825.94s)]
*  horrific. They're saying it's a living nightmare. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=830.94s)]
*  They're saying it's hell on earth. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=834.4200000000001s)]
*  They've reported to us the lack of water and food in the city. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=836.3000000000001s)]
*  They've reported to us the the dead bodies littering the streets and stories of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=840.58s)]
*  neighbors having to bury the dead bodies of their own neighbors that people have [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=845.22s)]
*  started dying due to lack of access to medical care. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=849.7800000000001s)]
*  People with chronic conditions who need access to insulin, hemodialysis, pregnant [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=853.3000000000001s)]
*  women who need women who need access to safe birthing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=857.62s)]
*  And and then also the many, many people who have died from the violence and from the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=861.62s)]
*  shelling inside the city. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=866.26s)]
*  Alex, Doctors Without Borders or MSF, as you call it, Medecins Sans Frontières, has [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=870.34s)]
*  had a lot of experience with taking doctors into some of the worst places in [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=875.38s)]
*  the world in terms of atrocities and dangers. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=880.3000000000001s)]
*  You are facing a situation where not only is your medical supply chain imperiled, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=884.6600000000001s)]
*  but there have been hospitals and medical facilities that have been hit. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=889.94s)]
*  How does this affect the delivery of your services? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=893.82s)]
*  I mean, it affects it enormously because indeed we do work all over the world in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=896.06s)]
*  conflict zones, but we do it by with our principles of neutrality and impartiality, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=901.02s)]
*  negotiating with all partners and under the rules of international humanitarian law. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=906.3399999999999s)]
*  We try to work in a protected environment such as hospitals, negotiating with all [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=912.5799999999999s)]
*  parties that it is in everyone's interest for civilian noncombatants to have access [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=917.6199999999999s)]
*  to medical care, as is their right due to the fact that we have a lot of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=922.02s)]
*  due to international humanitarian law and what we also call the rules of war. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=925.98s)]
*  And until present, we can see that the rules of war have not always been respected so far. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=930.0600000000001s)]
*  There's been shelling in residential areas. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=935.02s)]
*  There have been civilian casualties, innocent people who should be safe to stay in [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=937.58s)]
*  their homes or should be safe to choose to leave and seek shelter elsewhere. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  And we haven't been seeing that. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=947.46s)]
*  We've seen hospitals being hit and there has been bombings in numerous residential [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=948.54s)]
*  areas. So it makes us our ability to work incredibly complicated. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=954.98s)]
*  We don't have the guarantees we usually try to obtain in conflict zones to have all [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=959.66s)]
*  parties respecting humanitarian access for the population. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=964.02s)]
*  We haven't been able to have those sort of assurances and guarantees until now. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=968.1s)]
*  So we haven't been able to access Maripol in the way we would like to bring in [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=972.02s)]
*  supplies, to bring in personnel and to support the health system. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=976.94s)]
*  What does that actually mean, Alex, for the volunteers on which your organization [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=979.9s)]
*  exists? Obviously, you get donations, but you have doctors, nurses, health care [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=984.9s)]
*  professionals and other volunteers who go into these places. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=990.9s)]
*  They are going in to a place where they do not have the normal guarantees that they're [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=994.26s)]
*  used to. There are never any guarantees with anything Doctors Without Borders does. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=999.42s)]
*  But how does that affect the flow of people? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1003.3s)]
*  I mean, you know, it affects our ability to send people to the places where the most [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1005.74s)]
*  needed. So we have we have many, many staff in Ukraine who are operating in different [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1011.58s)]
*  parts of the country. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1018.1s)]
*  But the staff we have currently in Maripol are actually there because there was an [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1020.1s)]
*  ongoing project before the war started. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1024.22s)]
*  It's a project that opened in 2015 when the conflict in the East began. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1027.6200000000001s)]
*  And so it's staff who are already there with other ongoing activities to then up there [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1031.78s)]
*  once the conflict started. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1038.26s)]
*  We'd like to send emergency teams. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1039.62s)]
*  We have teams ready to go. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1041.86s)]
*  We have supply ready to go if such a passage opens up. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1043.26s)]
*  But until now, it hasn't. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1048.1s)]
*  And so we are unable to access the places like Maripol, which have the highest needs [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1049.4199999999998s)]
*  right now. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1053.3s)]
*  Last week, we introduced you to 11 year old Alex, who is a senior at the University of [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1055.3s)]

*  forced to flee his home to escape Russia's assault. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1065.02s)]
*  So far, about one and a half million children have fled Ukraine. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1068.02s)]
*  And according to the United Nations, for almost every second this war continues, another [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1071.42s)]
*  child becomes a refugee. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1076.7s)]
*  But Hassan made his 600 mile voyage alone, traveling from southeast Ukraine to the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1078.42s)]
*  Slovakian border with nothing but a backpack, a plastic bag and this phone number written [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1084.66s)]
*  on his hand. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1089.7s)]
*  It was that phone number that connected him to siblings in Slovakia. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1090.7s)]
*  Now, according to the Slovak Ministry of the Interior, Hassan, quote, won over everyone [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1094.74s)]
*  with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a real hero, end quote. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1098.9s)]
*  But this was not the first time war displaced Hassan and his family. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1104.3400000000001s)]
*  The first time was about 11 years ago when he was just a baby. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1108.54s)]
*  Hassan and his siblings had to flee to escape violent conflict in their home country of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1112.26s)]
*  Syria. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1116.7s)]
*  Russia, of course, intervened in the Syrian conflict with airstrikes to help the Assad [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1117.94s)]
*  regime, striking both rebel held military outposts and civilians. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1122.66s)]
*  At the time, Hassan and his family fled to his mother's native country, Ukraine. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1128.54s)]
*  They have not seen their father since they escaped Syria. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1132.46s)]
*  The family says he disappeared in the fighting. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1135.3s)]
*  After Hassan successfully escaped Russian violence again, this time in Ukraine, his [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1138.22s)]
*  mother, Yulia, expressed her gratitude to Slovakia in a video saying, quote, I am very [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1143.1s)]
*  grateful that they saved the life of my child in your small country. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1147.98s)]
*  There are people with big hearts. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1153.02s)]
*  Yulia said she had to stay in Ukraine to take care of her mother, who could not move on [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1155.3s)]
*  her own. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1159.26s)]
*  But as the intensity of the Russian assault increased, Yulia decided she had to just take [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1160.26s)]
*  her mother and their dog and try to make it to Slovakia. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1164.5s)]
*  And she succeeded. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1168.6799999999998s)]
*  This week, she was reunited with her children with the help of Slovak police officials. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1170.16s)]
*  She got to greet each of her kids with a hug after war threatened to separate this family [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1174.48s)]
*  a second time. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1179.28s)]
*  This was the look on Hassan's face when after weeks apart, he finally got to hold his mother [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  again. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1186.0400000000002s)]
*  Pure joy. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1187.0400000000002s)]
*  Now that the family is safely back together, the Slovak police force says Hassan's older [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1188.0400000000002s)]
*  brother is looking to secure accommodations for the family and set up schooling for his [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1192.74s)]
*  siblings. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1196.8400000000001s)]
*  They are beginning a new life together, defying the threat that war poses to all families [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpBtBpGZj-k&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
