# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 25
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4)
*  The person who was the head of the Republican Party during Donald Trump's time in office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=0.0s)]
*  and during his effort to throw out the election result and stay in power anyway, and during [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=5.64s)]
*  his effort to run for election again after having done that, is Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=9.8s)]
*  And she pitched in and helped. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=19.56s)]
*  She helped set in motion the part of the plot that involved sending fake Trump electors [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=22.56s)]
*  to Congress from states that Trump did not win. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=27.6s)]
*  So Republicans in Washington could use those fake fraudulent electors' slates to contend [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  that maybe Trump did win those states, even though he didn't. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=36.6s)]
*  And don't believe me on that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=40.68s)]
*  There she is on page 23 and page 27 of the federal indictment charging Donald Trump with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=42.96s)]
*  conspiring to defraud the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=47.82s)]
*  There's her personal appearance in this scene of the crime, as alleged by the U.S. Justice [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=50.2s)]
*  Department in this ongoing criminal case. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=54.98s)]
*  In Michigan, where the fake electors are themselves now on trial, she told the state of Michigan [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=59.06s)]
*  in writing explicitly, do not certify the election results. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=64.62s)]
*  The Detroit News has reported that with Donald Trump on the phone with her, she directed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=68.5s)]
*  Michigan election officials to not certify the vote. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=73.3s)]
*  She told them, quote, do not sign it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=76.92s)]
*  We will get you lawyers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=80.64s)]
*  She pitched in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=84.74s)]
*  She was part of the project. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=85.78s)]
*  And what was the project? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  It was to use the power of the Republican Party, Republican officials in the states, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=89.78s)]
*  Republican officeholders in Washington, the national Republican Party that she runs, to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=94.97999999999999s)]
*  use the party's power to reject election results, to take over the government and hold power [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  by other means. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=104.78s)]
*  And this project is now ongoing, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Now the project is to tell the American people that those efforts around the 2020 election [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=109.86s)]
*  were righteous. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=116.42s)]
*  That 2020 election, it wasn't OK. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=117.42s)]
*  Those election results were not correct. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=121.16s)]
*  We shouldn't believe American elections. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=123.22s)]
*  We shouldn't believe American elections are real elections. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=125.64s)]
*  American election results should not be seen as real. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=128.74s)]
*  They should not be respected. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=131.34s)]
*  That's the project now, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=132.98s)]
*  I mean, it didn't work to overthrow the government the last time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=133.98s)]
*  But as long as you can build on that first effort, as long as you can keep up the anti-election [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=136.46s)]
*  mythology, then you are priming your people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=140.94s)]
*  You're priming the American public to not accept the results of the next election either. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=145.62s)]
*  You're telling them that they're going to need to take power by other means because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=152.02s)]
*  the election isn't going to be how we do it anymore. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  You're also priming people, honestly, to vote to give up this supposed democracy we have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=160.56s)]
*  because what good is it anyway? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  So what are we really losing if we decide we're going to lose this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  Elections are fraudulent here anyway. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=174.02s)]
*  Who cares if we give them up? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=175.82s)]
*  Ronald McDaniel has been pitching in on that too, continuing to say since 2020 that that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  election wasn't right, that the American public should know that that vote wasn't real. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=184.18s)]
*  And that is a message not only about 2020 but about this next election and about whether [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=188.44s)]
*  or not elections should matter at all and whether we should bother having them at all. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=193.1s)]
*  The Republican Party getting behind that message is a choice. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=198.3s)]
*  I mean, Trump himself is going to do what he wants to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=202.5s)]
*  We've always had guys like Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=205.34s)]
*  Sometimes they wear ridiculous little uniforms, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=208.06s)]
*  But we've always had guys like that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=210.18s)]
*  We've never before had a big storied, important American political institution embrace a guy [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=212.46s)]
*  like that, even when it came to overthrowing the American system of government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=219.46s)]
*  And in a time like this, it's hard, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is a challenging and worrying time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  Republican officials have to figure out whether they're going to stand up for the American [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  system of government or not. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  Republican politicians, you know, Congress has to decide if it's going to assert its [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=246.86s)]
*  own relevance. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  They're going to assert their own independence, their own role in the government and stand [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  up for our system of government or not. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=256.22s)]
*  Judges and prosecutors have to decide if they're going to be braver than they ever thought [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  they'd have to be in this job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=264.66s)]
*  They have to decide whether they're going to stand up to the threats and the violence. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=267.06s)]
*  And nevertheless, be independent, be fearless, stand up for their own independence and thereby [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=272.62s)]
*  stand up for our system of government. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  Regular citizens have to decide if we're going to brave the threats and the violence, to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  stay involved in politics, to work for campaigns, to volunteer as election workers despite all [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  the threats, all the attacks, all the violence, to stand up for our system of government. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=294.53999999999996s)]
*  And then there's the press, which is both reporting on all of this and is also part [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=308.74s)]
*  Because just as a strongman needs to control the judicial branch or get rid of it, needs [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  to control the Congress or get rid of it, needs to control the political opposition [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=314.62s)]
*  or get rid of it, what the strongman most desires before all of that, the necessary [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=318.46s)]
*  precursor to all of that, is to control the free press or get rid of it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=322.74s)]
*  And in the press, we do not take it personally when we get attacked. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=330.06s)]
*  When they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason, we don't take [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=336.9s)]
*  it personally. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  But we do defend ourselves as an institution, not because we're personally offended by [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=344.1s)]
*  the way that we're treated, but because a free and uncowd press is necessary for our [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=349.54s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=354.06s)]
*  A free and uncowd press is part of our system of government. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=355.74s)]
*  We stand up for ourselves as a way of standing up for our country and for our Constitution, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=360.22s)]
*  the First Amendment to which makes it possible for us to exist at all. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=365.3s)]
*  And so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues, both at MSNBC and at NBC News, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=373.34000000000003s)]
*  who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company putting on the payroll someone [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=378.86s)]
*  who hasn't just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=385.44s)]
*  to get rid of our system of government. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=391.76s)]
*  Someone who still is trying to convince Americans that this election stuff, it doesn't really [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=395.56s)]
*  work, that this last election, it wasn't a real result, that American elections are [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=401.76s)]
*  fraudulent. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=408.32s)]
*  Because that argument, that is a necessary part, that is the most necessary part of the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=411.44s)]
*  overall project of getting us as Americans to give up on this election stuff, because [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=416.0s)]
*  wouldn't we rather have a real man in charge anyway, somebody who could really get some [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=420.36s)]
*  stuff done, if only we could clear away all the things in his way. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=423.56s)]
*  We have a long history in this country of forgettable men telling us that we need a [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=429.1s)]
*  new system of government where everything's under their control and politics is over and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=434.4s)]
*  this new strongman way of government is going to make America great again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=438.91999999999996s)]
*  We have had a lot of these guys. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=442.96s)]
*  But our generation's version of this guy has gotten a lot farther than all the rest of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=446.56s)]
*  them. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=454.4s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=456.28s)]
*  He would have been as forgotten as all the rest of them had he not been able to attach [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  himself to an institution like the Republican Party and had the leader of that party in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  his time not decided that she wouldn't just abide him, she would help. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  She would help with the worst of it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=475.82s)]
*  It's my understanding that MSNBC's leadership did not object to Ronna McDaniel being hired [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=481.26s)]
*  by NBC News when the matter first arose. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=486.78s)]
*  But when the hiring was announced and MSNBC staff essentially unanimously and instantly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=490.46s)]
*  expressed outrage, our leadership at MSNBC heard us, understood and adjusted course. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=497.86s)]
*  We were told this weekend in clear terms, Ronna McDaniel will not be on our air. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=505.66s)]
*  Ronna McDaniel will not be on MSNBC. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=511.38s)]
*  And I say that and give you that level of detail because there has been an effort since [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=515.7800000000001s)]
*  by other parts of the company to muddy that up in the press and make it seem like that's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=522.2s)]
*  not what happened at MSNBC. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  I can assure you that is what happened at MSNBC. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=528.2800000000001s)]
*  Ronna McDaniel will not appear on MSNBC, so says our boss since Saturday, and it has never [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=531.76s)]
*  been anything other than clear. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=537.72s)]
*  And I will also say, you know, if you care what I think about this, I will tell you the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=542.16s)]
*  fact that Ms. McDaniel is on the payroll at NBC News, to me that is inexplicable. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=544.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you wouldn't hire like a wise guy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=551.92s)]
*  You wouldn't hire a made man like a mobster to work at a DA's office, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't hire a pickpocket to work as a TSA screener. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=563.88s)]
*  And so I find the decision to put her on the payroll inexplicable. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=568.32s)]
*  And I hope they will reverse their decision. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=573.8s)]
*  And it's not about, you know, Democratic Party, Republican Party. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=575.92s)]
*  It's not about partisanship. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=579.84s)]
*  It's not about right versus left. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=581.16s)]
*  It's not about being a political professional versus some other kinds of person. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=582.72s)]
*  It's not about being mean or nice to journalists. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=587.28s)]
*  It's not about just being associated with Donald Trump and his time in the Republican [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=589.74s)]
*  Party. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=593.84s)]
*  It's not even about lying or not lying. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=594.84s)]
*  It's about our system of government and undermining elections and going after democracy as an [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=596.56s)]
*  ongoing project. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=604.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=606.92s)]
*  And this is a difficult time for us as a country. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think that means we need to be clear-eyed about the implications of it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=613.4s)]
*  Difficult times make for difficult decisions. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  We are contending with something we've never had to contend with before. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=620.8s)]
*  In the news business, yes, we are covering an election, which we do all the time, but [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=624.56s)]
*  we're also covering bad actors trying to use the rights and privileges of a democracy to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=627.92s)]
*  end democracy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=632.4s)]
*  The chief threat among them now is not the rioters and the kooks, but the slick political [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=633.7199999999999s)]
*  professionals who are turning their considerable talents to laundering violently revolutionary [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  claims that America's elections aren't real, that election results aren't real, and that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=643.64s)]
*  they shouldn't be respected. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=647.4s)]
*  We are contending with this now not from William Dudley Pelley's brown-shirt militias, right, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=648.88s)]
*  but from the multi-billion dollar massive political operation of one of the two governing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  parties of the United States of America. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=658.28s)]
*  And that's new. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=662.52s)]
*  And with our country up against something that daunting and that scary and that dangerous [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=664.24s)]
*  for the country, I think bad decisions will inevitably happen. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=670.04s)]
*  Mistakes will be made. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=675.16s)]
*  But part of our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing, us recognizing [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=677.96s)]
*  when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=686.12s)]
*  Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=693.56s)]
*  Not digging in, not blaming others. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=699.2s)]
*  Take a minute. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=703.72s)]
*  Acknowledge that maybe it wasn't the right call. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=706.08s)]
*  It is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=708.52s)]
*  It is a sign of strength. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=712.84s)]
*  And our country needs us to be strong right now. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=716.76s)]
*  You are being served. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  This is where election denialism hits the road. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=722.88s)]
*  This is what it looks like in real life. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  You can see in the video how the Maricopa supervisors, they hustle out pretty quickly. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=728.0s)]
*  Law enforcement blocks these people who are yelling at them and jostling them. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=732.0s)]
*  And if you're wondering what all the yelling is about, all the shouting about treasonous [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=737.36s)]
*  and you are being served. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=740.36s)]
*  After the supervisors left, one person in the crowd laid it all out. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=743.08s)]
*  12 signatures, which means each individual person is person liable for over $21 million. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=746.88s)]
*  Just from this paperwork, if they don't resign within three days, they will be personally [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=753.88s)]
*  served with a writ of full warrant and an opportunity again to rebut any one of our [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=758.96s)]
*  claims, which I'm making right now. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=764.4399999999999s)]
*  None of them have signed a note of office. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=766.16s)]
*  None of them are bonded to we the people. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=767.64s)]
*  All of them are foreign invaders acting as government. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=769.52s)]
*  They are not our government. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=772.04s)]
*  Therefore, we will be serving them a writ of full warrant with a waiver of tort. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=773.52s)]
*  And if they still do not rebut, we'll be notifying the military. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=778.4s)]
*  And they can be held off, hauled off, I'm sorry, to a military tribunal. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=780.92s)]
*  And I think we all know the penalties of treason. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=785.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=787.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=789.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=790.32s)]
*  We'll be serving them with a writ of full warrant, with a waiver of tort. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=791.32s)]
*  If they do not rebut, we'll be notifying the military. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=794.96s)]
*  They can be hauled off to a military tribunal. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=797.08s)]
*  We all know the penalty for treason. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=799.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=800.36s)]
*  Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, for what it's worth, almost all of them are Republicans. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=802.72s)]
*  They're all foreign invaders who are now liable for millions of dollars because somebody yelled, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=806.8s)]
*  you're being served. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=812.08s)]
*  If they don't resign in minutes, the military will come and execute them. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=813.48s)]
*  And however this might look to us watching it on video, for the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=819.4s)]
*  having a bunch of people rush the dais where they're sitting, yelling that they're traitors [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=825.56s)]
*  and they should all be killed, is scary. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=829.24s)]
*  Here's how The Washington Post reported it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  Quote, the scene at the February 28th meeting terrified many county employees and others [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  who were reminded of what happened after Joe Biden won the county and with it Arizona in [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=839.16s)]
*  the 2020 presidential race. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=843.36s)]
*  Back then, Trump supporters used baseless claims of fraud to try to pressure or scare [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=844.8s)]
*  elected leaders into changing the county's election results. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  After the 2020 election, you might remember this was the scene for days on end outside [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=853.4s)]
*  that county elections department when the votes were being tabulated. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=858.0s)]
*  There are mobs of often armed Trump supporters gathering outside the building, yelling at [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=860.64s)]
*  the election workers inside. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=866.4799999999999s)]
*  At one point, they surrounded one elections worker outside the building. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=867.88s)]
*  The person had to be pulled out of the angry crowd by a sheriff's deputy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=871.28s)]
*  Arizona has been a hotbed of election denialism ever since, as epitomized by the circus of [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  that bizarre arena audit of the 2020 election. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=882.48s)]
*  The state's attorney general is closing in on a decision now whether to criminally charge [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=890.28s)]
*  the fake electors from Arizona who signed forged documents after the 2020 election claiming [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  that Trump had won the state rather than Biden. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=899.12s)]
*  Just today, a man was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison for making [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=902.4s)]
*  repeated death threats in 2022 against Katie Hobbs, who was then Arizona's top elections [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=906.14s)]
*  official and is now governor. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=911.42s)]
*  The head of the U.S. Justice Department's elections threat task force had a press conference [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=913.82s)]
*  in Phoenix today after that sentencing to drive home the message that threats against [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=917.96s)]
*  election officials will not be tolerated. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=922.12s)]
*  They will be prosecuted and you will go to prison. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=924.24s)]
*  Quote, in training poll workers for this year's presidential election, the office of Arizona [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=926.76s)]
*  Secretary of State Adrian Fontes is preparing them for a series of worst case scenarios, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=931.64s)]
*  including combat, coordinating active shooter drills for election workers, sending kits [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=936.8399999999999s)]
*  to county election offices that include tourniquets to stem bleeding, devices to barricade doors, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=943.2399999999999s)]
*  hammers to break glass windows. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=949.88s)]
*  Arizona has been ground zero for election denial and threats and intimidation of election [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=952.64s)]
*  workers ever since the 2020 election. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=956.96s)]
*  Things do not seem to be getting better ahead of this next election, but this time at least [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=959.52s)]
*  state officials do know a lot more about what they're up against. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=966.0400000000001s)]

*  Thank you so much, Rachel, for having me. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=972.96s)]
*  Is it fair to say that things aren't better since 2020 in Arizona and that as we head toward [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=975.4s)]
*  this next election, you're expecting to see a continuation or maybe even a worsening of [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=981.54s)]
*  some of the sorts of threats and sort of craziness that we saw in Arizona a few years ago? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=985.82s)]
*  Well, I think in balance, things are actually better. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=991.58s)]
*  Our elections officials are much better trained. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=994.98s)]
*  They're more prepared. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=997.18s)]
*  We know what to expect for the most part. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=998.66s)]
*  There are some new emerging wrinkles, but we've been here. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1001.14s)]
*  We've seen that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1005.1s)]
*  And those pictures you showed of those armed crowds outside of the warehouse, that was [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1006.1s)]
*  my warehouse. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1010.02s)]
*  My election in Maricopa County in 2020, we got through that. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1011.06s)]
*  We got through 2022. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1014.9399999999999s)]
*  We will get past 2024 and we will protect democracy. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1016.34s)]
*  Tell me some of the specifics of your planning. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1021.14s)]
*  This is obviously a threatening environment, not just in terms of physical safety for you [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1024.3s)]
*  and your staff, but in terms of making sure the election can be carried out without being [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1028.74s)]
*  hindered by external forces. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1033.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, first, the background. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1037.18s)]
*  We've lost senior election officials in 12 out of our 15 counties here in Arizona. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1038.54s)]
*  But to shore up the load, we're making sure that everybody who is coming in, most of whom [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWzwXKcYK4&t=1043.98s)]
