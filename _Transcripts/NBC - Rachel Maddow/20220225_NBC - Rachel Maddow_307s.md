# Russians Reject Putin And His War On Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA)
*  Today, I learned that when professional tennis stars win big matches, one thing they do, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=0.0s)]
*  it's kind of a weird newish tradition. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=9.08s)]
*  I don't know how long this has been going on. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=10.64s)]
*  But a thing they sometimes do is they take a marker, they take a pen, and they write [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=13.32s)]
*  something on the lens of a TV camera that has been covering the match they just won. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=17.32s)]
*  How did this start? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=22.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=23.48s)]
*  But this is a thing they do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=24.64s)]
*  Here's Naomi Osaka drawing this little cat. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=25.64s)]
*  That's a thing she does. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=29.16s)]
*  This is an Italian guy who won a match even though he had the stomach flu. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=31.12s)]
*  What he wrote on the camera lens was, thank you, emotium. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=35.32s)]
*  Emotium, grazie. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Which is really funny if you have a six-year-old sense of humor, which I absolutely do. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  This is a thing that tennis stars do when they win matches. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Right now, there's a big pro tennis tournament on in Dubai. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=51.56s)]
*  And a Russian player named Andrei Rublev, R-U-B-L-E-V, Andrei Rublev. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=56.04s)]
*  He's ranked number seven in the world. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=60.64s)]
*  He's at that Dubai tournament, and he won a match there that will advance him to the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  final. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  When he won today's match, he didn't say anything, but he did walk over to the nearest TV camera [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  and he took out a pen, and he wrote on the camera lens, no war, please. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=72.72s)]
*  Again, he's the number seven ranked men's tennis player in the world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=79.92s)]
*  He is Russian. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=84.7s)]
*  This was his note to the camera today upon winning that match. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=85.7s)]
*  The number one ranked U.S. man in the world is also Russian. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  His name is Daniel Medvedev. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=93.98s)]
*  He is playing at a big tournament in Mexico right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=96.38s)]
*  This was his wife sitting in the stands watching him at that Mexico tournament. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  We dropped the lower third there so you can see what she's wearing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=104.28s)]
*  We dropped that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=107.58s)]
*  There it is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=108.58s)]
*  She's wearing a shirt in the colors of the Ukrainian flag while she was in the stands [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=109.58s)]
*  there watching her husband play again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=113.54s)]
*  He's the number one ranked men's tennis player in the world. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  The most famous Russian athlete in the whole world is the massive hockey star Alex Ovechkin, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=119.54s)]
*  who plays for the National Hockey League in the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=125.22s)]
*  Ovechkin has previously been an outspoken supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=128.38s)]
*  but today he told reporters, quote, Please no more war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=133.78s)]
*  That home in Russia, the biggest star on that country's wildly popular national soccer team [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=141.02s)]
*  is a striker named Fedor Smolov. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=145.98s)]
*  He just posted on Instagram, no to war with the Ukrainian flag and a broken heart emoji [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=150.38s)]
*  next to it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=156.26s)]
*  International Soccer just announced that Russia will no longer be allowed to host the Champions [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=158.94s)]
*  League final. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=162.12s)]
*  They were going to be hosting that in St. Petersburg in May. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=163.12s)]
*  That match has been yanked from Russia now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=166.94s)]
*  Formula One car racing has also pulled its next major race out of Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=170.05999999999997s)]
*  The Eurovision Song Contest announced today that Russia will not be allowed to have a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=174.61999999999998s)]
*  team compete in this year's Eurovision. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  And as Americans, we don't tend to care that much about the Eurovision Song Contest, but [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=181.54s)]
*  it is an absolute national obsession in Russia and across most of Europe. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  Russia's been kicked out of it for this year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=193.33999999999997s)]
*  And each of these things is, I know, it's a little Lego in a larger brick wall, sports [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=197.02s)]
*  stars saying a thing, cultural things being cancelled, sports things being pulled out [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=202.22s)]
*  of Russia, business decisions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=209.5s)]
*  They're all little Lego blocks. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=212.86s)]
*  But they're adding up to a wall that is starting to amount to global ostracism, global pariah [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=214.98s)]
*  status for Russia, thanks to the actions of their president, Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=219.66s)]
*  And it's one thing for a country to do something unpopular and to be treated as such globally. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=225.34s)]
*  It is another thing for a nation's leader to do something like that while his own people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=231.8s)]
*  hate what he's doing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=236.08s)]
*  For Vladimir Putin, this moment of global ostracism, global pariah status comes as his [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=238.48s)]
*  own people hate it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=244.74s)]
*  Russian music stars, Russian cultural figures, now the biggest sports figures in the country, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=247.44s)]
*  they are all braving the considerable wrath of that dictatorship to speak out publicly [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=251.64s)]
*  against this insane war that Putin has started. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=256.28s)]
*  Everyday Russians all over that country, even though Russians are being threatened with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=260.44s)]
*  prosecution as rioters and terrorists, if they dare to turn up to any sort of protest [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=264.0s)]
*  against the war in Ukraine, yesterday Russian citizens were arrested for protesting anyway [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=269.32s)]
*  in more than 50 different Russian cities. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=274.12s)]
*  Today another 500 Russian citizens were arrested for again defying their increasingly unhinged [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=277.04s)]
*  government to go protest in the streets against Putin waging this war. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU7uksA_XOA&t=282.72s)]
