# 'That's all it takes': Maddow cites polls showing impact of Trump guilty verdict
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg)
*  The effect of all of this legal jeopardy and now this felony conviction on candidate Trump for 2024 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Has been an open and evolving question with the public [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  there was polling in November at the New York Times and Sienna College that suggested that if Trump were convicted and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=10.72s)]
*  sentenced in any one of these cases a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=17.96s)]
*  significant number of Trump voters in swing in swing states [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=20.76s)]
*  Would switch their support from Trump to Biden about six points overall certainly enough to cost Trump a close election [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=24.6s)]
*  An exit polling from the early stages the Republican presidential nomination [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=32.08s)]
*  Anywhere from three and ten to four and ten voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina said Trump being convicted [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Would mean that he was not fit to serve as president [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=44.2s)]
*  That was January February of this year around the same time a poll from Bloomberg and the morning consult [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=47.7s)]
*  Found more than half of registered voters saying Trump would lose their vote if he were found guilty of a crime [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=53.92s)]
*  Well now that Trump has been convicted and convicted 34 times. We're no longer talking about this as a hypothetical [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=61.24s)]
*  It's doubly important to keep in mind that polling voters about a possible future event is notoriously difficult [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=68.12s)]
*  But because the news gods have a sense of timing a new poll conducted in May and released [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=75.44s)]
*  Today yes today [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=82.3s)]
*  Asked voters specifically about the hush money trial in New York [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=84.78s)]
*  Which might be the only trial of course to start and finish before the election [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=88.8s)]
*  This is the new NPR PBS Marist poll again released today, but before the verdict [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=93.16s)]
*  Most voters set a conviction in the hush money trial wouldn't affect their vote [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=99.7s)]
*  67% saying it would make no difference among overall voters a conviction might actually [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=103.86s)]
*  Benefit Trump by 15 points mostly among Republicans the percentage of Republican voters who said they would be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=109.94s)]
*  Less likely to vote for Trump if he got convicted in the hush money trial was down to 10% [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=116.3s)]
*  Put all those things together and PNN PR's own headline here is is probably instructive [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  They say quote Trump verdict would likely move only a small number of votes poll five [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=127.06s)]
*  But if recent elections of course are any indication a small number of votes is in a few key places [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  That's that's all you need to change the outcome Jen you were talking about this in terms of yeah [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=138.9s)]
*  Voters that are not necessarily [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  Persuadable voters in the traditional sense but voters whose voting behavior might be affected by a criminal conviction, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=146.06s)]
*  And it's as you said it's very hard to test a hypothetical right because on one hand some people who said yeah [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=153.14s)]
*  It might make me less likely [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=159.5s)]
*  They might this might have happened and they might be like no I still like that guy right so that's possible [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=160.9s)]
*  The other piece of it that's very hard to measure in polls is the emotions of it right and and what people feel about the character [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=165.94s)]
*  Because some of what is hard to measure is do people look at him and think there's too much baggage [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=172.82s)]
*  Or if he's doubling down up four weeks from now and saying this is like a screwed up system [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=178.06s)]
*  And it's a rigged system and gotta get rid of all the judges [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=183.26s)]
*  We gotta get rid of all the judges, and he's attacking the judge and his family are people like this is too much [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=186.06s)]
*  I don't want to hear him talk about this anymore [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=192.5s)]
*  We it's hard to measure that because everybody because people vote by emotions and how somebody makes you feel so I think that's it's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=195.45999999999998s)]
*  Such an important and interesting point about how he will react to it and what that will do to his [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=203.38s)]
*  Campaigning ability right because it really is a problem for him the like obsessive Jan six lost election [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=209.26s)]
*  Grievance, I think as just as a messaging tool for persuadable voters [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  I think obviously it's very good for the faithful but him doing like long rifts about judge Mershon on the stump [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=221.26000000000002s)]
*  I think is not that effective [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=227.86s)]
*  Even if it's even if the verdict itself doesn't move people the degree to which he like obsesses about this publicly and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  Consistently as his main campaign message. I think is a possible [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=236.82s)]
*  That's where his kind of the the mantra of the Trump years, which is my grievances are your [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  I am your they could do it to me your Laura Trump today was treating out [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  Quotes from her father-in-law saying they came after me because I'm standing in the way of them and you effectively [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing and that is the answer is a way for him to talk about his own travails and then map them onto [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=257.06s)]
*  His supporters [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=262.78s)]
*  Supporters have been busted for paying hush money to foreign stars to come [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=264.78s)]
*  Catch and kill to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=271.62s)]
*  Suppress who among us doesn't have these schemes already lined up with David [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=274.62s)]
*  Howard exactly I'm here to serve for you [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  But that's one way where he can keep talking about it and presumably some portion of his supporters [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=283.38s)]
*  I'm just I'm also just really curious at a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=288.5s)]
*  Are people aware level? Yeah, just as an empirical question. Not even does it move people or not? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  My sense was that a certain [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=297.94s)]
*  Portion of the electorate was pacing paying very careful close attention to this trial. Yeah, the majority of voters were not [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=301.38s)]
*  Mm-hmm that there's some universe of voters who didn't know that much about it and who are gonna wake up tomorrow or today to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=307.46s)]
*  The banner headlines everywhere. This will be news that when you ask Americans a week from now [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=315.34s)]
*  Have you heard that Donald Trump was convicted of multiple felonies? They will tell you yes, they will know that and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm curious what that does we don't know [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=327.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's such an inch and there will be money spent regardless of how the Biden campaign spends their money on ads outside [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  Gruesville there will be a lot of money spent [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=335.96s)]
*  I would bet on this the other thing that I think is kind of like [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  Interesting to watch here in terms of what Trump does or what he says [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=341.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he's a he's addicted to the adulation from his core base, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=345.14s)]
*  And he knows his core base loves this retribution message and loves this message of I'm the victim [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=350.02s)]
*  So it would require him having some discipline not to seek the adulation from the core of his base in order to talk about [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=356.34s)]
*  Other issues. I mean, I thought one of the most interesting things he did today [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=363.17999999999995s)]
*  Well all sorts of things it was quite a day for him [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  But was when he was returning to his apartment building, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=368.14s)]
*  And he kind of turned around and like lifted his fist to raise it to the cameras [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he did the two fists at once which is a very bad [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=376.34s)]
*  Like a smart move for a photograph or something, but it was like he was still seeking [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=379.14s)]
*  Support or clapping from people so I'm degree look at it [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=384.26s)]
*  I've looked into this moment for weird because for a while because it was weird because he did the one fist and then he [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  Did the two fists? Yes started to do that. What did you find out? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  He was outside Trump Tower and there were people outside Trump Tower [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=401.58s)]
*  Yeah from our reporting as best as we can tell from the report the public facing reporting that we have seen on this [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=405.5s)]
*  It was a pretty healthy mix of people who were there to give him a one finger salute [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=410.54s)]
*  Yeah, say Neener Neener [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=415.06s)]
*  You've just been convicted and a mix of some Trump supporters, too [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=416.1s)]
*  And so he walked up to them knowing the cameras were on him sort of pretended like there was a big adoring crowd [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=420.18s)]
*  Yes, where most of the people were giving him a Bronx cheer or as I said a one finger salute [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=425.38s)]
*  He was sort of cheering a crowd against him knowing that the cameras are pointing one way, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  Which is kind of fascinating [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=435.70000000000005s)]
*  Yes [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean in and then he did it but and his crowds have not turned out to protest for him at the courthouse except in very [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=438.18s)]
*  Small that no base loves his message. No matter what I would see the core base is not enough to get him elected [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=443.70000000000005s)]
*  Beyond that he's surrounded by special interest groups who are willing to ignore [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  Convictions and everything else as long as they get their thing totally right whether it's the NRA whether it's white evangelicals [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=454.5s)]
*  Whether it's the private equity community fossil fuel doing is checking in [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=460.98s)]
*  Hey, am I still getting that thing? I need if I am I'm good to go [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=464.66s)]
*  Yeah, but they both but they've also got the counter [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=468.18s)]
*  They've got the counter example sitting right in front of them with Michael Cohen, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=470.74s)]
*  Which is that you can show Trump all the you know of sequest [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=473.70000000000005s)]
*  You know kissing up that you want you can give them all the campaign donations you want you can serve him [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=478.02000000000004s)]
*  You can actually take a hit to your own reputation for him and you might think that you're doing a transactional thing with him [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  But if the transactional thing doesn't work for him in the end, yes, not like he's gonna stand by you [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=487.94000000000005s)]
*  You know one other aspect of this we talked about this on my show yesterday the piece by Eric Levitz [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=491.74s)]
*  I thought was very smart in Vox which is about the way the electorate is polarizing along lines of high trust low trust [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=497.3s)]
*  Which is that people that that signal lower levels of social trust towards their fellow Americans and trusted institutions are moving [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=504.02000000000004s)]
*  Right and moving and these are the people who are the least likely to vote [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=511.72s)]
*  they're sort of the outer perimeter that the most alienated and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=515.7s)]
*  The they're a population that Biden is having the most trouble [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=519.26s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and I do think that one of the issues there is that if folks don't trust the system to begin with [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  Which is that population where you're seeing in some ways the the largest amount of hemorrhaging the polling? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=528.38s)]
*  Being like well a jury of this peer is convicted and may not be that effective a message [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, and I think that's a huge part of how everyone's thinking our friend Andrew Weissman former FBI general counsel would like to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=538.54s)]
*  Jump in Andrew do I am I right to am I right to be advised that you have a question I [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=545.42s)]
*  Do have a question. I have a question for Jen Psaki because she's always asking me questions. I love it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna flip the script and so this probably picks up on what Chris is talking about which is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=557.04s)]
*  This was an example today of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=565.34s)]
*  What judges say all the time about facts and law? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=568.58s)]
*  Matter in a court of law and that that I would think is a message that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=573.34s)]
*  It seems to be Joe Biden's message as well because he's an institutionalist and he when he took office [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=579.82s)]
*  He was very much about I want to restore faith in [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=586.5s)]
*  Institutions and it's also not the case that this this verdict didn't just appear. It's based on facts [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=590.26s)]
*  Mainly as people have pointed out from [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=598.18s)]
*  Loyalists to him just like the January 6 hearings [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  Why is that not the message that they're sort of jumping on even if I get your point? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=603.54s)]
*  Maybe not today because it's not needed [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=609.02s)]
*  But why isn't that sort of a bigger deal is it or is it they don't need to do it because for people like me [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=611.3399999999999s)]
*  Who believe in facts and law I've already you know somebody they don't worry about [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean we were just talking about this a little bit [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=620.78s)]
*  I think that will be a part of the base of the foundation of the message, right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=622.9s)]
*  And if you're the White House right now [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=627.26s)]
*  You're discussing not today because as you mentioned [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=629.02s)]
*  He's this is the day always that he is down as you say in the White House where he doesn't do any public events the day [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=631.38s)]
*  That's the anniversary of his son's death, but tomorrow they will be discussing. How should we frame this? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=636.4s)]
*  It's and on every level what should Corrine say from the briefing room? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=642.42s)]
*  What should the president say when he finally answers the question? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=646.78s)]
*  They're gonna be preparing and debate prep for how they should answer it and to your point Andrew [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=649.58s)]
*  I think their president Biden's comfort space [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=653.7800000000001s)]
*  He is an institutionalist of course and a defender of the rule of law and institutions that his comfort place is gonna be that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=656.58s)]
*  It is the defense of democracy defense of how our system works defense of the every man as Alan Bragg said today [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=663.62s)]
*  Who was sitting on the jury? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=669.98s)]
*  I think for them you make a calculation on the phases and the stages of it [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=671.5400000000001s)]
*  And so tonight was more a stage for there's a campaign statement [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=676.36s)]
*  They put out it was longer that as I was saying earlier to me [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=680.84s)]
*  I read it as more of a message to Democrats out there to say like hey guys like there's still a big campaign to be [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  Fighting ahead, but they're gonna have to determine what their thousand foot messages [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=690.64s)]
*  And I think that what you just said is is right in the rubric of what it what it will sound like I would expect [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=695.16s)]
*  You [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQH56E3Bqg&t=706.36s)]
