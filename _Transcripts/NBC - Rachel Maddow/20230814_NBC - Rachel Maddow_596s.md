# 'This country is too precious': Clinton calls on GOP to quit Trump 'cult,' help U.S. heal
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI)
*  When we were watching Gwen Keese-Fleming and Lawrence speaking just a moment ago about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=0.0s)]
*  the mandatory minimum prison sentence in Georgia for a RICO conviction, and Ms. Keese-Fleming [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=4.68s)]
*  noted, you know, maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=10.36s)]
*  And I saw you chuckle. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=12.56s)]
*  Clearly, we are getting ahead of ourselves and we are thinking about potential sanctions [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=14.0s)]
*  as a result of any of these trials, let alone, I mean, there's these things getting to trial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  There's the question of conviction. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=23.44s)]
*  There's the question of sentencing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=24.6s)]
*  But then there is, at the end of that road, the prospect of the prohibitive favorite [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=26.4s)]
*  for the Republican presidential nomination being in prison. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=38.08s)]
*  Do we as a country have an interest in him not going to prison so that we can still call [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=40.08s)]
*  ourselves a country where leading politicians don't get locked up? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=46.8s)]
*  Look, I think that's going to be a much debated issue throughout the country over the next [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=50.48s)]
*  months because holding him accountable can happen in a number of ways. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Prison obviously is one of them, but there are other approaches that can be taken. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=63.68s)]
*  I think one of the important comments that came out of this long day down in Georgia [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=68.88s)]
*  was by the former lieutenant governor when he said, this is a pivot point. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=74.08s)]
*  The Republican party needs to move away. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  Quit being part of a cult, in effect, is what he meant, where you follow someone who lies to you, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  undermines legitimate processes of government. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  Move away from him politically. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, trying to get back to politics in the sense that we used to think we had it, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  despite all the human frailties that accompanied it, where, you know, you had [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=101.32s)]
*  parties that would sanction and hold accountable their own members. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=106.04s)]
*  I was on the impeachment inquiry staff. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=110.28s)]
*  You cannot make up my life, you know? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=112.2s)]
*  And so back in 1974, when the impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee was voted on, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=114.12s)]
*  four Republicans voted to impeach President Nixon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=123.0s)]
*  Then three members of the Senate, leading Republican senators, I think it was Barry Goldwater [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  and Howard Baker and I think Hugh Scott, went to see President Nixon and said, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=132.36s)]
*  this was a bipartisan vote. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=138.84s)]
*  You need to resign. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=141.08s)]
*  Well, that's almost impossible to imagine today because of what's happened to the Republican party, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  what they've allowed to happen to themselves. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  So I hope that we won't have accountability just for Donald Trump and, if there are others [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=151.4s)]
*  named in these indictments along with him, for their behavior. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=157.88s)]
*  But we'll also have accountability for a political party that has just thrown in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=162.76s)]
*  with all of the lies and the divisiveness and the lack of any conscience about what was being done [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=167.96s)]
*  to the country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=175.16s)]
*  In terms of getting out of this and coming out of this crisis stronger, hopefully, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=176.92s)]
*  for having confronted, I think, very dark prospects in terms of what this means for democracy, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=184.52s)]
*  it does feel like the Republican party as a whole is not ready to make that turn. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=189.72s)]
*  And I'm thinking really about Ron DeSantis as the guy who's running second to Donald Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  in the Republican primary right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=199.8s)]
*  He is promising that there shouldn't be an independent Department of Justice. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=202.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=207.0s)]
*  He's promising anything to try to get to some attention. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=207.88s)]
*  It's kind of pathetic, isn't it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  He's also removed two elected prosecutors in Florida who were chosen, who were elected, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=213.96s)]
*  who he stepped in and removed them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=220.84s)]
*  Georgia Republicans have given themselves the power to remove elected prosecutors as well [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=222.68s)]
*  just ahead of Fannie Wallace making this decision. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=227.88s)]
*  That law will go into effect about seven or eight weeks from now, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=230.68s)]
*  which will give them that opportunity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  It does feel like the idea of law enforcement being used as a tool of partisan politics [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  is something that, with whatever justification, the Republican party is really embracing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=241.8s)]
*  and ready to run with or without Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  That feels like a big step in the wrong direction. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=249.96s)]
*  Well, that's yet to be determined, Rachel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=251.56s)]
*  That is yet to be determined. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=253.72s)]
*  I think it is possible that there are many now in the Republican party who have signed on to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  that kind of approach to politics, that undermining of democracy, undermining the rule of law. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=263.88s)]
*  But the shadow of Trump looms so large over all of them, it's really hard to know, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=269.56s)]
*  once he's off the scene, one way or the other, politically or because of accountability arising [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=277.64s)]
*  out of the various indictments he faces, whether or not backbone will all of a sudden be regrown, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  regrown, whether conscience will once again be part of the Republican party ethos. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=301.08s)]
*  We hope because it would be for the good of the country that that were to happen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  But if it doesn't, the only way we can possibly contest it and defeat it is through the rule of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=306.84s)]
*  law, as we're seeing with these prosecutors at the federal and now the state level, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=314.2s)]
*  but also through elections, where we have to defeat those who want to weaponize divisiveness, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=319.0s)]
*  who want to undermine democratic values and institutions. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=326.84s)]
*  And that should be, frankly, nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=331.16s)]
*  People should all be saying what the so-called never Trumpers, the former Republicans who are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  now out beating the drums to say, you cannot support him and you cannot support the people who [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=340.52s)]
*  support his attitude toward our country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=347.32000000000005s)]
*  On the issue of sort of healing and getting better as a country on this, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=351.0s)]
*  in reading your article in the Atlantic, I feel like I get the diagnosis. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=357.32000000000005s)]
*  You talk about Surgeon General Vivek Murthy having essentially diagnosed this problem of loneliness [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  being a health problem in this country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=368.12s)]
*  You describe it as a real political problem as well. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  I get in a very fundamental way this idea that atomized, disconnected populations are really [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=373.4s)]
*  primed for extremism. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=381.56s)]
*  That's part of what makes us vulnerable to the call of strongman leadership and authoritarianism, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=383.0s)]
*  makes us susceptible to it like any other number of mature democracies around the world. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=387.88s)]
*  What I don't get is the prescription for how to fix that and whether that is a [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=393.24s)]
*  prescription that should come from people who want to be political leaders or whether [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  that's something we need to cure as a culture in some other way. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=400.68s)]
*  What's the way out of it? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=403.96s)]
*  I think it's cultural, political and probably economic as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=405.8s)]
*  I think we have to do a much better job of finding ways for people to work together again, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=409.8s)]
*  work together on community projects, work together through existing organizations, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=417.72s)]
*  whether it be civic or religious. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=423.48s)]
*  Look at the outpouring of help for the people in Maui right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=426.44s)]
*  That kind of volunteer effort that is so American, so much at the core of who we are when we are at [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=431.16s)]
*  our best. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=438.04s)]
*  But I also think that we have to do a better job of trying to stand up against the divisiveness [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=438.92s)]
*  and against the constant stream of lies and falsehoods that come out of not just politicians [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=444.76s)]
*  but also social media and other sources of information. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=454.12s)]
*  So there's enough work for all of us to do. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=458.68s)]
*  It's not just political leaders. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=461.64s)]
*  It's really everybody saying, you know, this country is too precious, too valuable, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=463.24s)]
*  too important to allow it to continue to be fragmented the way it has been. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=467.8s)]
*  And rebuilding that sense of trust and community is no easy task. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=472.92s)]
*  I don't think anybody would argue with how difficult it would be. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=477.64s)]
*  But there are ways of doing it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=482.6s)]
*  And let me just say, you know, I don't think Joe Biden gets credit enough for trying to model [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=484.52000000000004s)]
*  responsible leadership, you know, just kind of getting up every day, doing the job. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  The legislative accomplishments that came out of his first, you know, year and a half were amazing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=498.12s)]
*  We're rebuilding our infrastructure. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  We're once again investing in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and so much more. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=507.08s)]
*  We're trying to, from a legislative perspective, under his leadership, to put back into place some [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=513.4s)]
*  of the things that give people a sense, perhaps, of security and confidence, optimism about the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=520.2s)]
*  future. And, you know, what more can a leader do? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=525.56s)]
*  I mean, really, when you come down and think about it, you know, we've got [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=529.64s)]
*  Democratic governors now who are making school lunch free. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=533.16s)]
*  You know, that's a big deal because unfortunately we have a lot of kids who don't get adequate [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=537.24s)]
*  nutrition. And we have Republican governors who are lowering the age of employment so that 13 and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  14 year olds can now be put to work. That is, in a nutshell, kind of where we are. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=547.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't we want to join hands and support families in a difficult time and particularly [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=553.7199999999999s)]
*  try to give kids more stability to be able to have better choices [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=560.12s)]
*  instead of just ripping away every social support? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=564.92s)]
*  So this has to happen at all levels of politics, government, but more broadly society as well. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap8Z6ihB1EI&t=568.28s)]
