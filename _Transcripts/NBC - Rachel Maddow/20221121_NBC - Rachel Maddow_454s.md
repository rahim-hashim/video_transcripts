# Lessons From A World War II Scandal That Put The Justice Department To The Test
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y)
*  Joining us now is historian Bradley Hart. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  If you have been listening to the podcast, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=4.0s)]
*  Ultra, he is one of the historians you have been listening to. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=5.88s)]
*  He's also the author of the excellent book, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=8.34s)]
*  Hitler's American Friends, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=10.76s)]
*  the Third Reich's supporters in the United States, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=12.56s)]
*  which has just been an indispensable source for us in putting Ultra together. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=15.68s)]
*  Bradley Hart, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=20.42s)]
*  Thank you for being here. Congratulations on the podcast. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=22.56s)]
*  It's really a fantastic piece of work. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=24.66s)]
*  I have enjoyed every episode and I've learned something from everyone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=26.2s)]
*  You've learned stuff from it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=28.6s)]
*  I have. What's amazing about it, by the way, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=29.72s)]
*  is to hear these people's voices. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=31.84s)]
*  I know you've talked about this on the show before, but normal Lindean. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=33.24s)]
*  That's a voice that sticks with you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=36.08s)]
*  But even hearing John Rogge, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=37.36s)]
*  the Department of Justice prosecutor you were just talking about, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=38.64s)]
*  I'd never heard his voice before. It's amazing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=40.86s)]
*  It's funny, since the podcast has been out there, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=43.12s)]
*  one of the recurring conversations I've had is that people even [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=46.04s)]
*  involved in the news business have come to me and say, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  where did you find these actors? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=51.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=53.32s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, this is all archival tape. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=57.0s)]
*  You can't believe that this stuff is, I guess, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=57.32s)]
*  also you want it to be ancient history, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  so you can't believe there's tape of them, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=62.32s)]
*  but it's not that ancient. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=63.88s)]
*  I mean, the 40s is history that we can reach to. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=65.4s)]
*  We all know people who are alive when this happened. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=68.04s)]
*  There just aren't that many instances in American history [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  where you get people put on trial for sedition. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=74.16s)]
*  The number of points on the number line, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=76.88s)]
*  there just aren't that many to connect. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  I have to ask you and I don't want to assume that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=82.48s)]
*  because you just said those nice things [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  because you're in the podcast that you agree with every point of it, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=87.72s)]
*  but let me ask if you agree with that basic thesis, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  that the Justice Department clearly has a role, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=92.92s)]
*  but they shouldn't be seen as the silver bullet, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=97.0s)]
*  that there have been real weaknesses [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=98.92s)]
*  in the way they've approached these things in the past. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=100.36000000000001s)]
*  I think that's absolutely right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=102.0s)]
*  I mean, one thing that I think you point out well in the podcast [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  I talked about in the book as well is that a lot of the activity [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  we're talking about up until the point where people are actually [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=107.68s)]
*  committing sedition or other crimes is constitutionally protected. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=110.04s)]
*  Right? First Amendment, Second Amendment, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=113.44s)]
*  a lot of the groups that we're talking about here [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=115.36s)]
*  are saying really nasty things about people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=117.6s)]
*  That's terrible. Most people would agree with that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=119.32s)]
*  but it's not a crime. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=121.32s)]
*  Even some of the more militarized groups [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  when they're training with weapons and things like that, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=124.44s)]
*  that's still protected Second Amendment activity in a lot of ways. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=126.6s)]
*  And so I think the important point here is that the law has a role, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  certainly, but there's a wider civil society role [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=133.12s)]
*  in sort of policing the spectrum of extremism [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=136.76s)]
*  and the spectrum of our politics. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=139.44s)]
*  And in terms of that civil society role, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that I was really heartened by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=142.72s)]
*  and for anybody who's partially listened to the podcast [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=146.44s)]
*  and hasn't got to the end, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=149.0s)]
*  there's ways in which it has a bad ending. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=150.32s)]
*  But one of the, I think, surprising good endings [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=151.76s)]
*  is that there's all these members of Congress, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=154.32s)]
*  including members of Congress who are really powerful, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=156.52s)]
*  who are powerful enough to go to the attorney general [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=158.8s)]
*  and get a prosecutor fired, to go to the president [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=161.4s)]
*  and get another prosecutor fired, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=164.0s)]
*  to get a Justice Department report buried [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=165.72s)]
*  that was otherwise going to be public. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=167.8s)]
*  Members of Congress with a ton of sway. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=170.24s)]
*  Nevertheless, when their activities around this stuff come to light, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=172.76s)]
*  the voters throw them out. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=175.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=176.48s)]
*  And it's sort of surprising, given how powerful some of them were. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=177.12s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=180.32s)]
*  And you see some of these names are household names in this period, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=180.8s)]
*  Senator Burton K. Wheeler, who's alluded to, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=184.16s)]
*  this is one of the leading lights of the progressive movement at one time, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=186.28s)]
*  one of the leading lights of the Democratic Party, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=189.24s)]
*  being bandied about as a potential presidential contender, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=191.48s)]
*  even in 1940, when no one knows if Roosevelt's running for his third term. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=193.96s)]
*  So this is a man who has obtained semi-legendary status. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  And what's interesting to consider is if he had died, perhaps, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  in the late 1930s, might well be a venerated figure today in American politics. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  But because of what happens later on, he loses his seat in 1946. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  The Democratic primary reputation is tanked. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  So how do you square that in terms of accountability? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=214.72s)]
*  Obviously, this is the resonant point that looms large for us now, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=217.92s)]
*  given the challenges that we've got, the sedition trial now, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=220.72s)]
*  pending potential charges against the president for his role in this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=223.56s)]
*  I mean, you get somebody like John Rogge, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=226.88s)]
*  like the prosecutor that preceded him, William Maloney, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=229.8s)]
*  bringing these cases in court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=232.28s)]
*  They don't end up resulting in convictions, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=235.0s)]
*  even though they implicate these powerful members of Congress. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=237.68s)]
*  Certainly, those members of Congress never find themselves in the dock, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=240.68s)]
*  let alone in jail. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=244.56s)]
*  But you do also get them voted out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=246.32s)]
*  It's a civil society form of accountability that's driven, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=248.76s)]
*  essentially, by journalism, by activism, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=251.84s)]
*  by people coming to know what they did and judging them for it, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=254.8s)]
*  even though they're not locked up. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=257.92s)]
*  Ultimately, this is about the voters, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=260.16s)]
*  I mean, there is a ton of journalism done on this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=261.68s)]
*  There's incredibly hard-hitting ads that are run against these candidates [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=263.72s)]
*  when they're up for reelection at various points during the war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=266.76s)]
*  But ultimately, this is about the voters. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=269.24s)]
*  And I think when I was doing this research initially, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=271.16s)]
*  my first reaction was, why isn't this story better known? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=273.6s)]
*  I think you've had the same reaction doing the podcast. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=275.52s)]
*  But also, I think when I got to the end of it and sort of realized [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=278.24s)]
*  that there was sort of a form of almost justice in this way [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=280.48s)]
*  against these individuals who engaged in pretty bad behavior [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  in the 1930s and 40s, that was heartening. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=287.12s)]
*  The voters did ultimately punish virtually all of the figures [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=289.52s)]
*  that are included in this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=292.6s)]
*  Not all of them. Virtually all of them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=293.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that... [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=296.68s)]
*  I mean, maybe there'll be an ultra-season two someday. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=298.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=300.24s)]
*  And I know that your research on this era continues. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=300.64s)]
*  But one of the things that happens to the sedition defendants [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=303.36s)]
*  who aren't convicted and who kind of melt back into the sauce of American society [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=306.0s)]
*  is that some of them, at least, end up providing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=310.0s)]
*  some of the core, really radical basis for a very far-right part of the American, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=312.68s)]
*  pro-fascist, pro-Nazi, in many cases, Holocaust-denying part [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=319.96s)]
*  of what becomes the next era of far-right American politics. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=323.96s)]
*  I mean, the members of Congress who are associated with these folks [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=327.24s)]
*  get voted out and become obscure figures and die in obscurity. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  But some of these defendants end up becoming part of stuff [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  that is really scary in terms of what comes next on the American far, far right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=340.44s)]
*  I mean, some of these figures become associated with people like Gerald L.K. Smith, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=341.12s)]
*  who I know you mentioned in today's episode, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=343.96s)]
*  a very, very anti-Semitic inheritor of the Huey Long sort of machine in Louisiana [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  and also this sort of rabble-rousing style of speaking. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=351.96s)]
*  Huey Long is a figure until the late 1960s, early 70s in American politics. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=355.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=359.56s)]
*  And some of these figures are closely associated with his move. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=360.08s)]
*  And Elizabeth Dilling, another figure you talk about in the podcast, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=362.84s)]
*  I mean, she's active until the late 1960s when she dies [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=366.56s)]
*  as sort of a red-baiting conspiracy theorist. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=369.24s)]
*  So absolutely. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=372.08s)]
*  I mean, many of the sort of leading lights of this movement politically, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  especially in the America First Committee, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=377.44s)]
*  they pay a pretty steep political price. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Their careers are mostly over by the 1950s. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=380.8s)]
*  But the rank and file sort of melt back into society. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=383.4s)]
*  And that's one question I always ask myself in this research [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=385.88s)]
*  that I don't have an answer for yet is, what happens to everybody else? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=391.12s)]
*  We were talking hundreds of thousands of people who are involved in these things. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=391.44s)]
*  Yeah, the America First Committee had a million members, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=394.2s)]
*  A million members. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  And Father Coughlin, right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=396.76s)]
*  The most popular radio host of all time. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=397.88s)]
*  30 million listeners a week, by some estimates. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=399.84s)]
*  What happens to those people? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=402.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, you'll know it before I do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  And hopefully I'll be right there on your heels. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=407.4s)]
*  Bradley Hart, I really appreciate all that you did to help us tell this story. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=410.08s)]
*  Your work in this as a historian is absolutely, absolutely totally invaluable. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=415.12s)]
*  Again, where is it? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=420.12s)]
*  Bradley Hart's book is called Hitler's American Friends, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=421.96s)]
*  the Third Reich Supporters in the United States. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=424.88s)]
*  Sir, thank you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  Congratulations on this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=428.6s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQ1wDwUd3Y&t=428.96000000000004s)]
