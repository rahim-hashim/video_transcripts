# Why Musk May Regret Purchase Of Twitter When Reality Of Content Moderation Hits
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go)
*  Joining us now is Ben Collins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a reporter who covers disinformation, extremism, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=1.44s)]
*  and the internet for NBC News. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=3.68s)]
*  Ben, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=5.34s)]
*  It's nice to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=8.58s)]
*  Your beat is disinformation and extremism online. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=10.44s)]
*  Is your beat going to get worse or better now? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  It depends on what Elon Musk decides to do with this service. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=19.44s)]
*  Now, he's said a couple of things. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=22.2s)]
*  He's taken a lot of populist positions [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  on some user features, for example, the Edit button, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=25.8s)]
*  the much-fabled Edit button that was going to come to Twitter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=29.18s)]
*  He says that's going to happen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  That could be positive or negative. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=35.620000000000005s)]
*  We don't know what that looks like in practice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=36.68s)]
*  But he's also said a lot of things about free speech, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=38.84s)]
*  and that's great. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  Free speech is the fundamental principle of this country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=42.54s)]
*  But moderation is different than free speech. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=46.18000000000001s)]
*  And moderation is hard. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=49.14s)]
*  It's extremely hard. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=51.74s)]
*  In fact, it's an art, it's not a science. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=52.88s)]
*  It's an unwinnable game. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=55.38s)]
*  And he just got the worst job in the world. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=57.74s)]
*  He is now the king of content moderation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=59.72s)]
*  on the world's fastest-moving news platform. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  If he thought this was going to be fun, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=65.08s)]
*  I don't know what's going on in his head, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=66.74000000000001s)]
*  because this is just going to be a world of hurt. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=67.88s)]
*  I feel like, Ben, one of the things that we've seen [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=71.18s)]
*  when other people have not taken over big media companies, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=74.48s)]
*  but started their own niche media companies [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=78.42s)]
*  on this issue of free speech [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  and not doing content moderation, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=82.34s)]
*  and it being a wide-open Wild West, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=84.22s)]
*  and that's the point of it, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=87.02s)]
*  is that pretty quickly we get lots of ISIS beheading videos [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=87.86s)]
*  and child pornography and eating disorder, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=91.66s)]
*  dysmorphia photos, and other things that, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=97.3s)]
*  in some cases, are illegal, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=101.1s)]
*  and in other cases, make the site, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  make the use of the site impossible [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=107.28s)]
*  for normal humans with normal gag reflexes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=110.14s)]
*  Is that, A, is that fair, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  and B, how does Mr. Musk contend with, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  how would a Mr. Musk contend [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=123.14s)]
*  with that kind of previous experience [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=125.78s)]
*  when other people have taken on the same task? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=127.9s)]
*  Yeah, look, that's incredibly fair [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=131.46s)]
*  from both sides of this, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=133.82s)]
*  from both sides of the spectrum here, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  from the extremist forum side [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=137.94s)]
*  and from the civilian internet side. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=139.22s)]
*  So on the civilian internet side, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=141.34s)]
*  you have stuff like TikTok and Twitter and Facebook, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=142.52s)]
*  and here's a content moderation challenge [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=144.68s)]
*  from TikTok from a few weeks ago. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a girl on TikTok was trying to make slime, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=147.84s)]
*  the stuff that 12-year-olds make play with. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=151.0s)]
*  She was trying to make slime, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=153.56s)]
*  and she made may-bomb by mistake. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=154.38s)]
*  Now, is that free speech? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=157.06s)]
*  Should you leave that up? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=159.52s)]
*  TikTok took that down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=160.34s)]
*  They found it, and they were like, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=161.44s)]
*  this is very dangerous, really bad. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Should take this down. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=164.84s)]
*  You shouldn't be teaching kids how to make may-bomb. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=165.68s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=167.84s)]
*  Is, I would bet Elon Musk's Twitter [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  is going to take that down, but I don't know. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  I'm not really sure here what falls into that space, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=174.46s)]
*  especially now that he's taking the company private. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Oversight for this sort of thing will be very different. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=179.96s)]
*  And I will say, by the way, Rachel, everybody has a line. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=182.3s)]
*  4chan, for example, everyone thinks that 4chan [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=186.84s)]
*  is the worst site on the internet, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  and it was for a long time, but they had a line. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=191.72s)]
*  They had a direct line. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=196.16s)]
*  And that line, to them, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=198.2s)]
*  was animated depictions of child pornography. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=200.16s)]
*  And they started taking that down. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=203.28s)]
*  This was a few years ago. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's how we got 8chan. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  8chan said, we are going to create a space [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=207.6s)]
*  where literally everything is allowed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  If you wanna do those animated depictions [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=214.82s)]
*  of child pornography, it's allowed on 8chan. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  That was their line. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=220.26s)]
*  And that's, 8chan became a place [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=222.12s)]
*  where people dropped manifestos [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  before they did mass shootings. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=224.92s)]
*  That's where Q from QAnon came from. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=226.1s)]
*  It became a full-on extremist website. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=227.9s)]
*  That's the place without the line. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=230.34s)]
*  They ended up closing down, effectively, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=231.78s)]
*  and their owner, the guy who started that, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=233.34s)]
*  had a come-to-Jesus moment. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=235.26s)]
*  He changed his mind about the entire idea of this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=236.62s)]
*  His name is Fred Brennan, and he is a person [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  who has fought for years now to take down 8chan. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=242.1s)]
*  So everybody who thinks that they want complete, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=245.54s)]
*  unfettered free speech on the internet, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=250.14s)]
*  they meet their line eventually. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=252.54s)]
*  Ben, one last question for you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=254.54s)]
*  In business terms, is there anything that we know [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  about the terms of this deal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=257.94s)]
*  that would restrict Elon Musk [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=259.94s)]
*  from any particular kinds of changes? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  Or once he owns it and it's his private entity, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=264.5s)]
*  can he do literally anything he wants? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=267.82s)]
*  We don't fully know that yet, but it is his private entity. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  There are a lot of people at this company who are afraid. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  I've talked to people inside the company in the last few days, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=277.53999999999996s)]
*  and they are afraid, not just for their jobs, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=279.86s)]
*  but for the product they built [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=282.14s)]
*  and the town square they built. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=283.78s)]
*  They put a lot of work into this thing, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=286.06s)]
*  and they are afraid of what's gonna happen [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=287.86s)]
*  to a guy who has never done content moderation before [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=289.34s)]
*  taking over this platform. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=291.94s)]
*  Ben Collins, a reporter covering disinformation, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=294.46s)]
*  extremism, and the internet for NBC News, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=296.9s)]
*  just an invaluable resource in our company. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=298.86s)]
*  Ben, I'm grateful for you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=301.74s)]
*  Every single time you post anything [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=303.02s)]
*  or write anything for this company, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=304.78s)]
*  your reporting is about to get even more important [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=306.74s)]
*  in days ahead. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=308.94s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=309.78s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Ben. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i051BD239Go&t=312.74s)]
