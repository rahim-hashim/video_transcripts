# Melber: January 6 Hearings Show Trump Pushing Voter Fraud Even As He Complained About It
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw)
*  Remember ever recommending to anybody that Mr. Clark, meaning Jeffrey Clark at DOJ, be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=0.0s)]
*  given election related responsibilities? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  You mean beyond the president? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=21.0s)]
*  Well, beyond the president, I do recall saying to people that somebody should be put in charge [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=26.0s)]
*  of the Justice Department who isn't frightened of what's going to be done to their reputation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=39.16s)]
*  because the Justice Department was filled with people like that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=50.84s)]
*  You put somebody that's not frightened of what's going to be done to their reputation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=54.16s)]
*  Yeah, if the Justice Department was going to be used to throw out the election results [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=58.16s)]
*  and keep Trump in power, you'd need somebody to do that who was unafraid about the effect [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=62.919999999999995s)]
*  on their reputation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for that testimonial, Mr. Giuliani. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=70.24s)]
*  Also, behold, Jeff Clark. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=72.96s)]
*  And when he finished discussing what he planned on doing, I said, good. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=76.96s)]
*  Excuse me, sorry. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=82.36s)]
*  A-hole. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=84.36s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=85.36s)]
*  You just admitted your first step or act you take as attorney general who will be committing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=86.36s)]
*  a felony and violating Rule 6E. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=89.36s)]
*  You're clearly the right candidate for this job. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=91.36s)]
*  You are clearly the right candidate for this job. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=93.36s)]
*  The first thing you're going to do as attorney general is commit a felony and violate Rule [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=95.36s)]
*  6E. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Ari Melbert, what is Rule 6E? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  It's about grand jury secrecy and other types of federal obligations for keeping things [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=102.28s)]
*  secret, which matters a lot. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=107.08s)]
*  We have these incredible investigative powers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=108.52s)]
*  If they are abused by the government, that itself can be a violation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=111.52s)]
*  And as mentioned, that can even lead to charges. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  All of this goes to why Mr. Clark was not only in over his head but was gearing up to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=117.96s)]
*  do potentially illegal things, which may be why he just set his home rate at. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, so what Hirschman is saying there in that clip is, oh, what you're planning on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=126.16s)]
*  doing is a felony. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=131.56s)]
*  We also have Hirschman warning a different Trump lawyer, John Eastman, that he should [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=133.3s)]
*  get himself a good f-ing criminal defense lawyer. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=136.22s)]
*  This is along those lines. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=138.78s)]
*  He's saying it would be a felony what John Eastman wants to do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=139.78s)]
*  And also this whole idea that Eastman's going to investigate all of these fraud claims and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=142.22s)]
*  then immediately use that to bring, to overthrow the election, that would be a violation of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=147.1s)]
*  the way the Justice Department does its work. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=152.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=154.26s)]
*  And this actually dovetails with something really interesting that Congressman Schiff [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=155.26s)]
*  said to you tonight, as we've been discussing this with different people, we're in this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=157.82s)]
*  bonkers land where all these words are getting turned around. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=161.34s)]
*  When we hear about who lost and who's doing fraud, the voter fraud is being pushed by [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=163.7s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=169.1s)]
*  He wants voter fraud in Georgia to the tune of 11,000 votes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=170.54s)]
*  Having people submit fraudulent material to the government to override actual votes is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=174.48s)]
*  a voter fraud or elector fraud. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=179.38s)]
*  The people who kept talking about voter fraud in November that didn't happen are also the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=181.54s)]
*  ones trying to commit it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  And likewise here, the people talking about we need investigations, yes, there is room [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=187.17999999999998s)]
*  for certain types of investigations and we always keep an open mind. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=191.14s)]
*  But if you have a pretextual investigation ordered for political goals, that itself can [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=194.33999999999997s)]
*  be a crime. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=199.77999999999997s)]
*  It could be selective prosecution. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=200.77999999999997s)]
*  It can be the abuse of the fruits of that investigation, the grand jury material. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=202.27999999999997s)]
*  Basically, Rachel, not like one crime, but like a bunch. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  A bunch of crimes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  And again, getting back to this looming issue today where Jeff Clark, in many ways the subject [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  of today's hearing as much as President Trump was, his home, we learned just at the start [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=214.5s)]
*  of the hearing today was apparently the subject of a search warrant by federal officers yesterday [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=218.94s)]
*  morning. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=224.22s)]
*  We learned about that just as today's hearing started. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrWqm2O8RTw&t=225.22s)]
