# 'Rogue Pride extravaganza!': Concert defies Trump's Kennedy Center lockdown
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI)
*  Back in February, President Donald Trump fired the entire board of the Kennedy Center, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=0.0s)]
*  he named himself to be the cultural center's new chairman. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  As the Kennedy Center's new self-proclaimed chief, Trump boldly proclaimed that henceforth [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=12.84s)]
*  the Kennedy Center would ban all events that featured anyone in drag. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=18.64s)]
*  Trump's announcement was awkward for a lot of reasons, not least of which was that the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=25.64s)]
*  Kennedy Center is already scheduled to host the musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire next [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  summer. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=47.64s)]
*  Yeah, good luck doing Mrs. Doubtfire without drag. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=48.64s)]
*  Anybody interested in a show about a sad guy and sad guy clothes cleaning his ex-wife's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=54.56s)]
*  house? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=61.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=62.0s)]
*  Two weeks ago, Trump attended a performance of Les Mis at the Kennedy Center. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=64.16s)]
*  He was greeted by lusty booing from the crowd and also a coterie of extra fabulous drag [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=67.84s)]
*  queens who showed up at the performance essentially in protest and who themselves were met with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=75.56s)]
*  wild applause from the crowd who seemed very, very glad to see them. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=81.2s)]
*  But it turns out that's just the beginning at the Kennedy Center, at our National Cultural [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Center, because here is something I did not know before today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=92.48s)]
*  It so happens that if you are a member of Congress, you get special privileges at the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=96.48s)]
*  Kennedy Center. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  You are allowed to rent out space at the Kennedy Center specifically because you're a member [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=108.56s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=109.56s)]
*  Using that power tonight, Democratic U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper, Tammy Baldwin, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=111.0s)]
*  Jackie Rosen, Brian Schatz and Elizabeth Warren, the five of those Democratic senators, they [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=116.52s)]
*  all joined together to rent a 144-person theater inside the Kennedy Center. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=121.88s)]
*  And in that theater tonight, they are putting on a rogue pride extravaganza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=127.84s)]
*  It is a 90-minute program. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=135.96s)]
*  The event features a bunch of Broadway stars and actors. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=137.64s)]
*  One staffer on this show, McKenna Roberts, has been covering the event for us tonight. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Thanks to McKenna's reporting, we can report a completely packed house tonight at this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=146.76s)]
*  rogue protest pride event at the Kennedy Center with people turning out in their finest eveningwear, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=151.68s)]
*  looking pretty stunning, honestly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  These U.S. senators turned to the fancy Broadway producer, Jeffrey Seller, to help them put [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=162.28s)]
*  on this event right under Trump's nose tonight. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Seller told the New York Times, quote, this is a form of saying we are here, we exist, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=171.12s)]
*  and you can't ignore us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=177.04s)]
*  This is a protest and a political act. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=178.8s)]
*  It was all of that for sure. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=183.4s)]
*  We can hereby exclusively report that tonight, on top of all of that, it was also a party. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrfVeSvyseI&t=185.16s)]
