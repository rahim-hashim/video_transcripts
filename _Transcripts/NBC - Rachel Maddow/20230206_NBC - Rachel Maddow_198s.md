# Trump 'ball of wax' racketeering case too big for local NY prosecutor resources: Pomerantz
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE)
*  Mr. Pomerantz, you describe that consideration of using state RICO charges essentially against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=5.26s)]
*  But then you say, quote, the task of building out the proof on the whole pattern of enterprise [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=6.26s)]
*  corruption was simply too ambitious for the human and investigative bandwidth we had. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=11.08s)]
*  In other words, you think you had the substance of a case there, but it was basically too [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=17.04s)]
*  hard to do, given the resources of the DA's office. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=21.72s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=25.16s)]
*  It is fair. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=26.16s)]
*  One of the things that people need to remember is that the district attorney for New York [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=27.28s)]
*  County is a local prosecutor's office. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  This is not the kind of special counsel operation housed in the Department of Justice, which [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=35.68s)]
*  hires and has a staff of dozens of lawyers and investigators working on a single mission. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  We had a small staff of lawyers, many of them with other responsibilities. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=51.78s)]
*  We had to work within the jurisdictional and procedural limitations imposed by New [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=56.52s)]
*  York law, which are substantial. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  As a for instance, if we want to speak, as we did, to a witness who lives in Ohio, in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=63.32s)]
*  a federal case, FBI agents go service a PINA, and there's nationwide service of process. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  If we want to speak to a witness who lives in Ohio, we have to go through an elaborate [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=75.2s)]
*  legal procedure involving the Ohio authorities to see if that person can be compelled to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=79.12s)]
*  speak to us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=84.84s)]
*  For a whole variety of reasons having to do with the substantive law of New York, the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=86.04s)]
*  procedural law of New York, the resources that we had, it became clear over time that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=90.16s)]
*  an enterprise corruption case was simply biting off more than we could chew. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=97.84s)]
*  There came a point when both Kerry Dunn and I spoke with Sy Vance, the district attorney, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  about enlarging the team and adding resources to it and giving us more bandwidth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=109.16s)]
*  But again, we were coming up on the end of Sy Vance's term. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=115.0s)]
*  We wanted to hire some senior people with extensive prosecutive experience. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=119.32s)]
*  We didn't think it was fair to the incoming district attorney to start hiring senior people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=124.32s)]
*  at the very end of Sy Vance's term. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=129.88s)]
*  And in any event, we ultimately decided that largely for practical reasons, an enterprise [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=133.48s)]
*  corruption case was simply more than we could accomplish within a reasonable time, bearing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=141.68s)]
*  in mind that we were trying to work quickly and bringing a racketeering case, particularly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=147.56s)]
*  one that incorporates other stuff, Trump Foundation, Trump University, the hush money, the financial [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=156.76s)]
*  statements. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=164.64s)]
*  It's such a big ball of wax that ultimately we decided, you know what, let's focus on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  a smaller, more contained set of charges. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  And that's when we started to focus on the financial statements. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te7dlSNIebE&t=174.51999999999998s)]
