**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos)
*  No context I could provide here would make this any less weird. It is what it is and it stands on its own terms ready [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=0.0s)]
*  Here we go [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=6.92s)]
*  question [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=8.76s)]
*  Mr.. President you said if you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato just knock the crop out of them [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Would you that was your statement answer Trump? Oh? Yeah, it was very dangerous [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=16.44s)]
*  Question what was very dangerous answer Trump. We were threatened question with what? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=22.12s)]
*  Answer Trump they were going to throw fruit. We were threatened. We had a threat [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=27.66s)]
*  Question how did you become aware that there was a threat that people were going to throw fruit? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=33.3s)]
*  Answer Trump we were told I thought the Secret Service was involved in that actually but we were told and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  You get hit with fruit. It's no it's very violent stuff [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=44.94s)]
*  We were on alert for that question a tomato is a fruit after all I guess answer Trump [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=49.22s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=55.779999999999994s)]
*  Interjection from separate lawyer judicial notice, please [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=57.62s)]
*  Apparently that is agreed to at which point Trump's own lawyer jumps in and says it has seeds meaning a tomato has seeds [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=60.98s)]
*  Therefore it's a fruit [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=68.92s)]
*  Trump then continues. It's worse than tomato. It's other things also, but tomato when they start doing that stuff [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=71.22s)]
*  It's very dangerous. That's actually literally the transcript, but tomato when they start doing that stuff [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=78.42s)]
*  It's very dangerous question [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=84.98s)]
*  Who were you speaking to when you said answer Trump the audience? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=87.06s)]
*  Question so you were speaking to the audience when you said if they saw someone getting ready to throw a tomato [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=90.94s)]
*  Just knock the crap out of them. Would you? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=96.34s)]
*  Answer Trump that was to the audience. It was said sort of ingest but maybe you know a little truth to it [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  It's very dangerous stuff. You can get killed with those things [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=107.06s)]
*  Question so were you trying to incentivize people to engage in violence Trump's lawyer objections Trump answers anyway Trump [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=112.38s)]
*  No [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=119.86s)]
*  I wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=120.38s)]
*  Some fruit is a lot worse than tomatoes are bad by the way, but it's very dangerous [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  Question do you have any knowledge as to whether or not anybody was found to have tomatoes in their possession on that date? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=132.22s)]
*  Answer Trump, I don't know but it didn't happen. It worked out that nothing happened. It was [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=138.5s)]
*  The speech was good [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=144.62s)]
*  Question you said you were talking to the audience, but is the same true of your security [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=146.74s)]
*  Do you expect your security to knock the crap out of someone if they see them about answer Trump? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=151.18s)]
*  I was talking to the audience [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=155.9s)]
*  Question mr. President, please. Let me finish the question so we can get the whole record very clear [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=157.9s)]
*  Is it your expectation that if your security guards see someone about to throw a tomato? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=162.22s)]
*  That they should knock the crap out of that person answer Trump. Well a tomato a pineapple a [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  lot of other things they throw [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=176.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think that they have to be aggressive in stopping that from happening because if that happens you can be killed if that happens [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  question and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  Getting aggressive in your terms that includes the use of physical force answer Trump to stop somebody from throwing pineapples [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=187.94s)]
*  Tomatoes bananas stuff like that. Yeah, it's dangerous stuff [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=196.58s)]
*  I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=204.82s)]
*  Didn't I am not smart enough to make something like this up [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=206.82s)]
*  I am not smart enough to make up something this perceptive about how a particular man's brain works [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=209.94s)]
*  If I was I could write amazing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=215.9s)]
*  textbooks for political science classes about what to look for when trying to identify a person who shouldn't be entrusted with a lot of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  power [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=224.66s)]
*  You imagined a pineapple might be thrown and so yeah, you could be killed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=226.82s)]
*  This is a deposition that was just released late last night [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=233.7s)]
*  It's a deposition taken from former president Donald Trump six months ago [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=236.82s)]
*  In an ongoing civil case in New York about some protesters who were beaten up outside Trump Tower [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=241.14s)]
*  Shortly after Trump started his run for the presidency [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=247.3s)]
*  These protesters were beaten up by Trump's security guards and the protesters have contended in court that Trump is liable for them being beaten [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=250.02s)]
*  Up that day because they contend that Trump directed his security guards to beat up the protesters [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=257.62s)]
*  and as part of them making their case the protesters are trying to get at [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=264.18s)]
*  Trying to get it at Trump's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=269.46000000000004s)]
*  As they would put it Trump's established pattern of him asking people to physically attack others [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=271.94s)]
*  Him asking people particularly to physically attack other people who are protesting against him [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=278.5s)]
*  That argument that line of argument in the civil case that Trump [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  Directed those security guards to attack and physically beat up those protesters [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=290.7s)]
*  That is a pattern that Trump had established and has publicly displayed that line of argument from the plaintiffs in the civil case against Trump [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=294.62s)]
*  That's why [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=301.9s)]
*  This video was actually played in that deposition ahead of the questioning that I just read you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato knock the crap out of them would you seriously [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  Okay, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise I promise [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=317.58s)]
*  That was in 2016 February 2016 [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=325.94s)]
*  Which is actually after these plaintiffs were beaten up by Trump security guards outside Trump Tower [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  But these plaintiffs contend in court that you know Trump publicly imploring other people to knock the bleep out of people protesting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=335.5s)]
*  People posing the the terrifying threat of potentially throwing a tomato [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=344.26000000000005s)]
*  That shows the pattern of Trump ordering violence against protesters [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  Perhaps even violence out of keeping with any perceived threat the protesters might pose [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  Now if throwing a tomato is actually a lethal threat though, what wouldn't be justified [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  With the release of this deposition [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=366.3s)]
*  In this past day, we now know a whole new thing [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  We didn't know before about former President Trump, which is that he is apparently [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=372.06s)]
*  desperately afraid of a flying tomato [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  You [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQt1V4QGos&t=389.22s)]
