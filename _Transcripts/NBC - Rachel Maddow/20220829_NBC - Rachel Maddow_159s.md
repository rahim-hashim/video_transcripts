Video Description: Rachel Maddow points out that for all of the complicated court machinations behind Donald Trump's request for a special master to review the materials the FBI took back from Mar-a-Lago, the move is best understood as a means for Donald Trump to bog down the legal process for as long as he can.

# Familiar Trump Stall Strategy Plays Out In 'Special Master' Gambit
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI)
*  The news today has also been dominated—today and for the last couple of days has been dominated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=0.0s)]
*  by a lot of detailed and I think kind of fuzzifying reporting about exactly what's happening [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=5.12s)]
*  to the documents that the FBI took back from Mar-a-Lago and what's going to happen to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=10.82s)]
*  those documents. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=14.86s)]
*  You might have seen these headlines all weekend long about the request from Trump for a special [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  master to review those documents and a Florida judge considering the special master request. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=20.62s)]
*  And the filings today, including the filing from the Justice Department to that judge [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=26.76s)]
*  about the special master and what the Justice Department has looked at already and what [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=30.68s)]
*  they have. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=34.08s)]
*  I mean, for the people who are directly involved in this, I'm sure all of the minutia of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=35.08s)]
*  the ins and outs of this are fascinating. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=39.96s)]
*  But I also think it's easy to lose the forest for the trees on a legal tangent like this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=41.78s)]
*  particular one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=45.7s)]
*  I mean, bottom line, this whole fight over the special master thing, what this is, is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=46.7s)]
*  trying to delay the Justice Department and its ability to use the documents that they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=52.28s)]
*  took from Mar-a-Lago as part of their ongoing criminal investigation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=57.72s)]
*  So they're trying to delay it and make it more complicated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=62.68s)]
*  On the other side, the Justice Department now has to wait to hear from this judge exactly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=65.56s)]
*  what kinds of rules and procedures they're going to have to follow in order to use these [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  documents from Mar-a-Lago in their ongoing criminal investigation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=72.72s)]
*  And we expect that tomorrow the Justice Department will make a big long 40 page filing to the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=76.04s)]
*  judge hearing this dispute about why they think it should be more simple and straightforward, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=80.76s)]
*  even though Trump thinks it should be slower and more complicated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  It's basically it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=89.4s)]
*  How fast and under what circumstances does the Justice Department get to use the documents [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  that they took in the search warrant and executing the search warrant towards building their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=96.64s)]
*  criminal case? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=100.72s)]
*  And you can get into the weeds if you want to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=103.28s)]
*  This can be made to seem more complicated than that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=105.9s)]
*  But that is really what it boils down to. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=108.56s)]
*  The Trump side wants to make it more slow and complicated for prosecutors to use those [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=110.2s)]
*  materials they seized. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=113.44s)]
*  DOJ doesn't want that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=114.64s)]
*  But in the end, they'll do whatever the judge says. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=116.36s)]
*  And so the judge will say something. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=118.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=119.48s)]
*  Despite all the ink that that dispute received today, despite all the ink that that is definitely [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=122.92s)]
*  going to receive tomorrow, despite all the ink that this received over the weekend, I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=128.56s)]
*  do think it's a fairly easy to understand dispute. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=134.32s)]
*  And we'll just have to wait to see what the judge says. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57c1B5NYrI&t=136.64s)]
