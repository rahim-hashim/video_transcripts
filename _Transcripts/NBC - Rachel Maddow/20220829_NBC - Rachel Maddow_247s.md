# Intelligence Officials Assess Fallout Of Trump Mishandling Of U.S. Secrets
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4)
*  What can you tell us about what ODNI is doing right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=0.0s)]
*  They say they're doing a classification review and also a damage assessment about these documents [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=3.12s)]
*  that were taken from the former president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=9.56s)]
*  Can you shed any light for us on what those terms mean and what it means they're really [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=11.88s)]
*  doing? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=15.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's important to focus on this, and I'm glad that you have, because I think [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  there has been so much discussion over the weekend and really the last three weeks about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=22.16s)]
*  the criminal investigation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  And just as important as that is the national security threat posed by the mishandling of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  these highly sensitive, highly classified documents. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=35.28s)]
*  So the first thing that the director of national intelligence said in that letter to Congress [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=38.64s)]
*  that her office, the office of the director of national intelligence and the whole intelligence [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=43.099999999999994s)]
*  community would do is a classification review. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=48.459999999999994s)]
*  That means they're going to look at the documents that have been seized, the classified [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  and really determine is that level of classification still the right level of classification? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=56.08s)]
*  Because sometimes classified information over the course of time and events in the world [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=62.16s)]
*  is not necessary to be classified anymore, or it could be potentially classified at a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=68.56s)]
*  different level. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=72.68s)]
*  And so that classification review is to make sure or just check to see what are these documents? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=73.92s)]
*  Are they all still, do they all still justify the classifications they have? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Because as your viewers will know if they looked at the redacted affidavit, some of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=84.28s)]
*  the unredacted portions explain the different classification levels of review. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=88.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=93.2s)]
*  So from just damage to national security all the way up to exceptionally grave damage to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=94.2s)]
*  national security. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=98.48s)]
*  And then the second thing that the intelligence community is going to do, you've I think [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=99.48s)]
*  quite accurately referred to as a damage assessment, which is they are going to be concerned, very [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=104.4s)]
*  concerned with figuring out to the best of their ability, you know, what types of harm [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=109.92s)]
*  to national security could occur if these documents, this information or the information [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=116.12s)]
*  in these documents were to fall in people who are not authorized to receive them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=122.64s)]
*  That could be foreign adversaries, that could be foreign spies, that could be opportunists, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=126.72s)]
*  that could be criminals, et cetera. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=131.48s)]
*  So that means not only looking at the documents themselves and assessing, you know, how sensitive [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=133.82s)]
*  they are they, but trying to figure out who might have access, who have had access to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=139.56s)]
*  them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=144.2s)]
*  Certainly within Mar-a-Lago, we know this is a place that is open to visitors. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=145.2s)]
*  There are often foreign guests there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=149.08s)]
*  We now know that these materials were stored at all different locations within the premises. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=151.4s)]
*  And we know that there have been foreign agents or foreign nationals who have gotten into [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=156.72s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago under false pretenses before. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=162.96s)]
*  So some of the things that the department has asked for are the surveillance videos [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=166.7s)]
*  from within the premises to kind of see who is coming and going, who might have had access [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=171.46s)]
*  to the different spaces where these documents were found. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  They're going to be looking to see, do we have compromised confidential human sources [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=179.94s)]
*  who are in danger, potentially in danger now? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=185.1s)]
*  Do we have intelligence collection methods that are potentially at risk now? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=188.5s)]
*  Do we have foreign intelligence, meaning intelligence shared with us by our foreign [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=192.78s)]
*  government allies that maybe has been compromised? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=197.86s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=201.14s)]
*  All of these things are going to be concerns. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=202.14s)]
*  Do we have critical technologies that are important to our critical infrastructure, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=203.46s)]
*  our mass transportation, our communication systems, our banking systems, all of these [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=208.22s)]
*  things that potentially are at risk? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=212.86s)]
*  So all of that is going to go into this damage assessment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=215.76s)]
*  And that will be ongoing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=219.02s)]
*  It won't be something that can be finished in a week or two. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=220.98s)]
*  That's going to be a continuing process. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_JA-mped4&t=223.54s)]
