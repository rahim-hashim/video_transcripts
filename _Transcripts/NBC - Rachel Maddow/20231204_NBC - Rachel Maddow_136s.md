# 'A risk that we simply can't take': Why Trump's erratic lame duck raises red flags
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4)
*  Liz, you focus very early on in the book on the fact that Trump, two days after he lost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=0.0s)]
*  the election, he fired the defense secretary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=5.04s)]
*  Why do you think he did that? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Why is that important? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, to have a situation where a president who's lost the election, and so [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=12.52s)]
*  we should be going through a transition. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=17.88s)]
*  And a transition is a period of time when the United States is particularly potentially [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=20.8s)]
*  vulnerable, and especially the defense department. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=25.72s)]
*  You have to have a nonpartisan transition. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=29.04s)]
*  You have to have a situation where people are very focused on what is the good of the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=33.36s)]
*  country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=37.08s)]
*  And people recognize we may have lost the election, but those politics should not be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=38.08s)]
*  part of any kind of decisions that are being made, especially during a transition period. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=43.2s)]
*  And so to see Donald Trump fire his defense secretary, and we know now, of course, much [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=47.8s)]
*  more about what was happening at the time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=53.84s)]
*  I was very concerned at the time. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  He was also replacing other senior leaders at the department. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=57.52s)]
*  We know now, for example, that he had told Johnny McEntee at one point to ensure that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=61.32s)]
*  the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff of the Army knew that if they issued [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=68.88s)]
*  any more statements saying that the U.S. military had no role in our elections, that they would [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=73.28s)]
*  be fired. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=78.88s)]
*  And when you combine that with the steps that we know Mike Flynn was urging him to take, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=80.36s)]
*  things like deploying the military in order to rerun elections in swing states. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=85.72s)]
*  And I think that's one of the real dangers people have to focus on when we think about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=93.64s)]
*  a potential second Trump administration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=97.24s)]
*  You will take those people who were the most radical, the most dangerous, who had the proposals [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=100.08s)]
*  that were the most dangerous, and he will put them in positions of supreme power. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  And that's a risk that we simply can't take. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITTS5ZLHb_4&t=112.24s)]
