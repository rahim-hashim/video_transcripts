# 'No idea what he's doing': Series of bumbles and mistakes makes clear Musk is in over his head
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw)
*  Today, we can add to the list of principled resignations 21 people from Doge, people who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=0.0s)]
*  had been held over from the U.S. digital service because they were expected to work with Elon [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=6.88s)]
*  Musk's team at Doge. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=11.22s)]
*  Twenty-one of them resigned today saying, quote, We will not use our skills as technologists [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=12.94s)]
*  to compromise core government systems, to jeopardize American sensitive data or to dismantle [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=19.48s)]
*  critical public services. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=25.48s)]
*  We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize Doge's actions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=26.98s)]
*  Again, 21 members of the Doge service resigning today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=32.18s)]
*  The thing that is emerging, we're now five weeks and a day into this thing, the thing [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  that is emerging as the real weak card in their hand, and I don't know if we should [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=46.66s)]
*  have known to expect this or not, but it's just becoming more and more increasingly obvious [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=51.18s)]
*  with each passing day. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=55.94s)]
*  Their weakness is that they kind of suck at what they're trying to do. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=59.1s)]
*  I'm sorry to use that phrase, but they really do appear to be terrible at their intentional [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=64.38s)]
*  actions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=70.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=71.94s)]
*  And, you know, you don't want like a surgical robot to be terrible at what it does. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=72.94s)]
*  You don't want your letter carrier or your research scientist or your park ranger to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  be terrible at what they do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=82.78s)]
*  We need those folks to be good at what they do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=84.3s)]
*  And by and large, they are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=85.98s)]
*  The person you actually want to be terrible at his job is the guy who thinks it's his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=87.94s)]
*  job to destroy your country's government. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=92.22s)]
*  And Elon Musk is turning out to be very much up to that task. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=94.7s)]
*  I mean, amid all the pushback of all these various kinds, the best assistance the pushback [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=97.94s)]
*  is getting from the Trump and Elon Musk side is that Elon Musk really does appear to have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=103.42s)]
*  no idea what he is doing, and it is showing more and more every day. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=107.82s)]
*  And so it is really hurting what he is trying to do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=112.22s)]
*  Which is so sad. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=115.86s)]
*  Just take, for example, a short version of this saga from the last few days of Elon Musk [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=120.14s)]
*  initiating this email to all federal workers, including, hopefully, some people who no longer [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=127.38s)]
*  have access to their email because he ordered that they be put on leave and locked out of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=133.14s)]
*  government computer systems. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=137.68s)]
*  Oops, but that's how he's trying to contact them now by sending them emails to email addresses [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=139.18s)]
*  he won't allow them to check. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=144.18s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=146.1s)]
*  But this email, as you know, told everybody that they needed to give Elon Musk a list [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=147.1s)]
*  of the things they had done in the past week or else. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=153.18s)]
*  If they didn't send him this list, that would be taken as a resignation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=156.18s)]
*  And immediately, we saw multiple government agencies tell their workers, do not do this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=160.74s)]
*  Do not respond to this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  The Defense Department, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=168.18s)]
*  the State Department, the Homeland Security Department, the Education Department, the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=172.18s)]
*  Commerce Department, the FDIC, the IRS, the Energy Department, FEMA, the CDC, the NIH, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=175.1s)]
*  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, our beloved NOAA. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=180.18s)]
*  They all told the people who work at those agencies, do not respond to this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And in that list, I just mentioned a few different components of the Department of Health and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=191.18s)]
*  Human Services. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=196.04s)]
*  Just looking at that one agency for a second to get a sense of how this played in an agency [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=198.04s)]
*  that is run by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=202.68s)]
*  I mean, look at how this played there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=206.48s)]
*  Elon Musk sends this like middle of the night insane email to everybody who works at HHS, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  everybody who works in the rest of the government. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=214.84s)]
*  At HHS, they initially told their employees Sunday morning that they needed to respond [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  to this email and do what Elon Musk said. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=220.94s)]
*  Then an hour later, an email went out from the Trump-appointed Acting Director of the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=223.68s)]
*  NIH, which is part of Health and Human Services. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  And that person told all NIH employees, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, do not respond [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  to this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=236.18s)]
*  Then a few hours after that, HHS, as an overall agency, told all employees, actually, pause, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=237.18s)]
*  maybe hold, hold just a second. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=244.24s)]
*  We're not sure. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=246.48s)]
*  The ultimate advice given to people who work at HHS was that they could respond to Elon [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=247.78s)]
*  Musk's threatening email if they wanted to, but they didn't have to. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  And if they did, quote, do not identify by name or title any other HHS employees with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=259.66s)]
*  whom you have been working. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=266.3s)]
*  Do not identify by case name or otherwise matters you are working on. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=267.62s)]
*  Do not identify any specific grants or contracts or any specific grantees or contractors. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=271.58s)]
*  If you are engaged in any scientific experiments, research, or reviews, do not provide information [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=276.46s)]
*  that could allow anyone to identify the precise nature of your work. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=281.85999999999996s)]
*  The advice ended with this, quote, assume that what you write will be read by malign [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=287.06s)]
*  foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=292.29999999999995s)]
*  That's how well this thing is going. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=299.26s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management, which is the entity under which Musk sent out this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=302.08s)]
*  insane apparent prank email, the Office of Personnel Management then tried to sort of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  cancel Musk's threatening email, saying, oh, we can't believe anybody took that seriously. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=314.28s)]
*  Why did you think you had to do that? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=320.36s)]
*  Obviously, complying with that request would be totally voluntary. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=322.28s)]
*  You don't have to respond. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=325.84s)]
*  And if you don't send it back, that won't be taken as your resignation. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  Where did you get that idea? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=330.16s)]
*  That forget everything we just said email from the Office of Personnel Management appeared [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=334.64s)]
*  to be a knock on effect, sort of a side effect requirement that they didn't foresee that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=341.2s)]
*  had been set in motion thanks to another legal entanglement the Musk gang got themselves [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=345.92s)]
*  into when they set up this dodgy government wide email system that enabled this nonsense [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=350.6s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=355.64s)]
*  As part of setting up that email system, they apparently promised that any email they sent [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=357.76s)]
*  on that dodgy system would never involve compelled compliance to respond from government workers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=363.8s)]
*  So then when they told government workers, you'll be fired if you don't respond, they [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=372.2s)]
*  had to say, just kidding. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=374.8s)]
*  It was a weekend. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=377.24s)]
*  It was late. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=378.24s)]
*  We were a little, you know. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=379.24s)]
*  Then Elon Musk thereafter said, no, no, no, I mean it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  You do have to respond. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=384.36s)]
*  I mean, if you were like in a grunge band in 1977 and all of you did like a lot of drugs, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=386.0s)]
*  if one of you tried to fire the other members of the band, the rest of the band wouldn't [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=394.4s)]
*  take you seriously trying to do it this way. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=399.36s)]
*  And here is the president's top campaign donor saying this is how he's firing the whole federal [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=401.78s)]
*  government. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=406.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksOd69YgREw&t=407.84s)]
