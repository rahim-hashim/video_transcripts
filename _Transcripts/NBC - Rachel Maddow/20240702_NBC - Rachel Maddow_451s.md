# How Stormy Daniels made the mistake of taking Donald Trump seriously
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8)
*  In this part of my interview with Stormy Daniels, we're going to go through a little bit more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=0.0s)]
*  of her testimony from the trial, but also her elaboration on that testimony, explaining [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=4.48s)]
*  what she meant. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=9.34s)]
*  The criminal charges that were brought in this case were brought because of the means [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=11.5s)]
*  by which Trump, the candidate, tried to cover up and keep secret and disguise the fact that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=15.36s)]
*  he had paid this woman to keep quiet about this story. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Her elaboration here is important because what was it about this story that was so worth [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=24.6s)]
*  paying to keep quiet, that was worth the gymnastic, even baroque efforts he went through to try [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  to cover up that the payment was made? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=36.88s)]
*  Here's Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  Did you notice afterwards a DVD on the side table? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=43.64s)]
*  Yes, it was a DVD I had given him earlier and the gift bag from the show was on the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=46.64s)]
*  nightstand that I signed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=51.8s)]
*  Can I just stop there for a second? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=54.76s)]
*  This is a really stupid question, I'm sorry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Why does an adult film company sponsor a hole at a golf tournament? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=59.44s)]
*  Is it because it's funny because of the word hole? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  You're ruining one of my stand-up jokes, Rachel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=68.56s)]
*  Here's me, total prude, unable to talk about this, that I'm just kidding. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=70.56s)]
*  They've sponsored a hole and I had to keep saying it over and over again and it almost [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=74.72s)]
*  killed me. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=77.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=78.96s)]
*  That's why it's funny? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=79.96s)]
*  Now that you've ruined my comedy act, I can say it's basically like, so they brought myself [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=81.96s)]
*  and some of the other stars, they brought their own holes to the hole, so it's like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=88.52s)]
*  bringing sand to the beach. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=93.32s)]
*  Well done, thank you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Here all week, try the veal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  So you had given him a DVD because Wicked had brought you and other people from the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=101.44s)]
*  company to this golf tournament. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Were there lots of other adult film companies at the tournament? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=109.36s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=112.08s)]
*  We were the only adult film company, but we were in the gift room and everybody got to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=113.08s)]
*  sponsor a hole. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  See, I still can't even say it without laughing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of genius. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  It's inherently funny. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  And so the DVD was in the gift bags and they had brought different DVDs of the actresses. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  And that one in particular was a movie called Three Wishes that I wrote, directed, and starred [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=130.04s)]
*  in and he specifically wanted something that I had directed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=134.92s)]
*  And just why in my stupidity? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=139.24s)]
*  I thought maybe he really is serious about having me on the apprentices. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=140.72s)]
*  Because when you met him at the hole on the golf course, you sort of immediately started [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=147.56s)]
*  talking about the fact that you don't just star in films you've also directed. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=154.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  The owner of the company was introducing everybody that was there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  This is my contract girl, such as our publicist, whatever. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=164.32s)]
*  This is my contract star and director, Stormy Daydols. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=170.16s)]
*  And he was like, oh, so you're the smart one, you also direct. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=173.72s)]
*  And that's the basis on which you had continuing conversation with him about directing and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=177.44s)]
*  about your role in the business. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=180.72s)]
*  And do you mean, is what you're saying about that, when you say, oh, stupid me, I thought [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=183.4s)]
*  that meant. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=189.04s)]
*  By that, do you mean his expression of interest in you as a director and his asking you business [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=190.2s)]
*  related questions about the industry meant that you thought that you were having a business [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=195.76s)]
*  discussion? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=199.6s)]
*  It was legit. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=200.6s)]
*  And why it wasn't a red flag to have a meeting. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=201.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh, well, you went to a married guy's hotel room. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  What were you expecting? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=207.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, there's two parts to that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=208.32s)]
*  One, nobody knew who Melania was back then. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  I didn't know he was married. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=216.0s)]
*  I knew that he had famously been divorced from his wife before because everybody saw [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  that scandal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=220.48s)]
*  Did anybody in 2006 know the word Melania Trump? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=221.48s)]
*  They had been married just the previous year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=227.12s)]
*  But nobody knew. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Like, it wasn't a thing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  It was a famous thing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  I didn't know he was married until he told me. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=234.72s)]
*  Second, it wasn't a hotel room. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=235.72s)]
*  When people think hotel room, they think of the hotel rooms that 99 percent of people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=237.4s)]
*  have only stepped foot in, which is where you walk in and there's a bed and a dresser [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  and it's a hotel room. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=245.16s)]
*  This was a room that was bigger than my apartment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=247.32s)]
*  It had a dining room, a living room, two bedrooms. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=250.36s)]
*  If you had told me that it was a hotel room and you didn't know it was a hotel room, I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=253.56s)]
*  wouldn't think it was an apartment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=258.48s)]
*  Those of us who conduct business at conventions or things like that don't think twice about [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=261.76s)]
*  going to someone's suite that has a conference table in it and a table. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=266.6s)]
*  People like to be like, oh, you knew what you were getting into. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=271.2s)]
*  I've also gone to 100 other meetings in rooms exactly like that, that nothing bad happened. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=273.67999999999995s)]
*  Prosecutor says this is almost the end. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  When you were leaving and you went to leave, what, if anything, did you do or say? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  He said, we have to get together again soon. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  He went to kiss me goodbye and I just left as fast as I could. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=294.76s)]
*  You know, that was it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  Did he say anything to you about talking again? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  He said, we should get together again. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  We were fantastic together. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=304.12s)]
*  I want to get you on the show. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=305.92s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=307.36s)]
*  He didn't give me anything. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=308.36s)]
*  He didn't offer to pay me or anything or a cell phone number, nothing like that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=309.36s)]
*  Did he ask you to keep your encounter with him confidential? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=313.8s)]
*  No. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  Did he express any concern at that point about his wife finding out? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=317.48s)]
*  No. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  Did you end up having dinner in his room that night? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=323.64s)]
*  You said it was dark out when you left? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=324.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  And do you recall how you got back to your hotel? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  It was a cab. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=328.64s)]
*  After that night, did you tell anybody else about what happened? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=329.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=332.24s)]
*  Just give us a sense of the people that you told and what you told them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=333.24s)]
*  I told very few people that we had actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=336.56s)]
*  stop it, that I didn't say no. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=341.08s)]
*  A lot of people would just assume they would make jokes out of it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=343.12s)]
*  I didn't think it was funny. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  I didn't want to hear about it or assume that I was a paid prostitute, which I wasn't. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  So I told very few people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=352.0s)]
*  I also didn't want it to get back to anybody that I was dating. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=353.52s)]
*  So the overall picture in terms of your real life, not just in terms of this case, is that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=358.2s)]
*  this is a situation where you thought there might be a legit business reason to talk to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LvbPbnyuW8&t=363.96s)]
