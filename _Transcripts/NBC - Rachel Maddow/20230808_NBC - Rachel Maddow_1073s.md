# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 7
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo)
*  So there's some breaking news tonight in the latest federal criminal case against former President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=0.0s)]
*  We knew we were gonna get something in that case this afternoon or this evening. We didn't know we were going to get this other thing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=4.44s)]
*  Here's the situation. Let me explain it in layman's terms as I not a lawyer understand them on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=11.44s)]
*  Friday night special counsel Jack Smith asked the judge in this case for a protective order [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=17.6s)]
*  Which basically means when the government hands evidence over to Trump's defense team for use in the trial [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=23.0s)]
*  The judge should order Trump and his lawyers to not release any of that evidence publicly in making that request [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=28.16s)]
*  Jacksmith's team pointed the judge to this social media post from Trump last week [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=36.0s)]
*  If you go after me, I'm coming after you by putting this in there filing requesting the protective order [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=41.18s)]
*  They were basically alerting the judge to the presence of this posting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=46.64s)]
*  The implication was hey if this is the kind of thing this guy is saying publicly at this stage [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=51.28s)]
*  There's no telling what else he would post when we start giving him stuff. That's really sensitive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=55.48s)]
*  So on Friday prosecutors asked the judge for this protective order. They cited that troubling posting by Trump [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Today this afternoon we knew that Trump's defense team had to file its reply [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  They did [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=72.44s)]
*  Almost as almost as if they were confirming the contentions from the prosecutors in their filing with the judge [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=74.12s)]
*  They took this proposed protective order the things that prosecutors said Trump and his team should be barred from releasing to the public and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=79.86s)]
*  They said that a whole bunch of stuff should be crossed off that list. They specified recordings [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  transcripts interview reports related exhibits of witness interviews [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=93.62s)]
*  Trump's team said tonight we ought to be able to do whatever we want with all that stuff including making all that stuff available to the public [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=98.7s)]
*  So that filing from Trump's team saying no no protective order is necessary [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=106.86s)]
*  You should much more narrowly tailor it [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=112.78s)]
*  We should be able to do whatever we want with all the evidence that we get that was the filing we were expecting tonight from [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  Trump's team what we didn't expect was for Jack Smith's prosecutors to come back within just a couple of hours with a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=120.06s)]
*  big hard-nosed response pushing back hard on Trump's proposal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=127.54s)]
*  This is from the new filing from prosecutors that came in just within the last hour quote the defendant Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  Proposed an order designed to allow him to try this case in the media rather than in the courtroom [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=140.1s)]
*  The defendant's principal objection to our proposed protective order is that it would not permit him or his counsel to publicly [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=144.52s)]
*  Disseminate and publicize in the media various materials obtained from the government in discovery [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=151.3s)]
*  They also say they want to make sure Trump is not allowed to personally write down any [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  personally identifying information such as addresses and phone numbers of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=161.64s)]
*  Witnesses they say that quote is particularly important here because of the defendant and his co-conspirators [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=166.12s)]
*  practice as described in the indictment of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=172.04s)]
*  publicly targeting individuals in their filing Jack Smith's prosecutors urged the judge to implement the protective order that they proposed in [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  order to safeguard witness privacy and the integrity of these proceedings [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  In other words, hey judge, you know what this guy is like [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=189.0s)]
*  You know, he has a habit of publicly targeting witnesses against him and anybody else who goes up against him now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=191.72s)]
*  He's saying he wants to be able to publicize evidence and things about witnesses that we give him as part of this trial [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=198.02s)]
*  Don't let him do that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=204.36s)]
*  Again protective order was requested on Friday [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=206.72s)]
*  Trump's defense team had to file its response by five o'clock today [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=209.8s)]
*  They did so right before five o'clock then Jack Smith's prosecutors came back just a couple of hours after Trump's team [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=212.8s)]
*  Handed in their filing when prosecutors say they want these proceedings to go speedily. This is what they mean [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  They are apparently not kidding around and the judge appears to be on the same page because just in the last few minutes [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=226.12s)]
*  Oh wait, there's more just in the last few minutes [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=232.08s)]
*  The judge has ordered a hearing on the issue of this protective order to take place no later than this Friday [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=234.56s)]
*  Again, this minute the minute order from Judge Chutkin just handed down saying no dawdling people [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=242.28s)]
*  We are gonna do this this week. We are holding a hearing on it. No later than the end of this week [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=249.48s)]
*  So we are a big country [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=255.28s)]
*  330 million people very diverse better very [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=257.72s)]
*  Heterogeneous in terms of everything in terms of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=262.76s)]
*  backgrounds traditions [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=266.11999999999995s)]
*  The way we live our values our opinions [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=268.4s)]
*  but for all our diversity I [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=272.4s)]
*  Think that we Americans can all probably agree. I think we can all come together around the somewhat obvious idea [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  That if there is one consumer product that American needs one thing. We're just [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=282.44s)]
*  missing as a country [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  It's probably a gun that is specifically designed for babies a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  Gun specifically designed to be wielded by babies [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  specifically an assault rifle style [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=303.48s)]
*  Semi-automatic long gun made to look kind of like the civilian version of a US military issue m4 rifle, but sized down [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=305.92s)]
*  so like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  Toddlers can use them not toy guns not like super soakers squirt guns [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Not BB guns not cap guns real guns that fire real real bullets. You've heard of the AR 15 [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  Will now meet the JR 15 as in the junior AR 15 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=327.6s)]
*  The company that makes it is just super cute about the whole thing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=333.0s)]
*  They call themselves we won the tactical we won not we won but we won as in little one [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=336.24s)]
*  Until recently they had logos for the little girls and little boys version of this gun for babies [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=343.6s)]
*  The logos were this little kid skull and crossbones with a pacifier for boys and this little skull and bones [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=349.36s)]
*  Pacifier with a crossbone with a pacifier for girls [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=356.28s)]
*  Because why should any kid have to wait until they're done with the teething process before they can start carrying their own assault rifle [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=361.4s)]
*  They advertise the JR 15 as smaller safer lighter [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=369.28s)]
*  They apparently recently did drop the pacifier logos and the Scooby-Doo cartoon font in some of their advertising [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=373.64s)]
*  But it's not like they're no longer claiming. This is an assault rifle for babies. I mean [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=382.12s)]
*  They could change their marketing of it, right? They could say this is for a different purpose [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=387.76s)]
*  They could have started to say they're making this mini sized assault rifle for people with unusually short arms [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=391.8s)]
*  Hey [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=397.48s)]
*  Are you built like a t-rex hard time reaching the steering wheel and the pedals at the same time have we got the assault rifle? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  For you, or they could market it for people with low upper body strength [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  Can't handle a gun that weighs more than two pounds find yourself unable to lift a carton of milk anymore [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't worry doesn't mean you shouldn't have a semi-automatic blowback action assault rifle of your dreams [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=415.12s)]
*  It's specifically designed for you great great grandma [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=420.52s)]
*  When they dropped the pacifier logo [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=424.08s)]
*  Explicitly targeting the gun to the teething toddler market that might have seemed like it was you know [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=426.92s)]
*  Signaling that they were abandoning the whole idea of assault rifles for kids [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=433.36s)]
*  But no it turns out they just dropped the pacifier logos and the cartoon font [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=437.8s)]
*  But they're making clear that it is not just for people with little tiny arms or not just for people with very poor upper body strength [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=443.68s)]
*  It's still definitely for preschool [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=450.52s)]
*  And the reason you can tell that is still their targeted market for this gun is because this is the image that pops up on the splash page splash page at their website [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=453.52s)]
*  Clear enough [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=466.52s)]
*  Here's another view of the same target consumer maybe she's what five think she's five [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=468.52s)]
*  And if America is now marketing smaller later fully functional semi-automatic assault rifles for five-year-olds [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=475.52s)]
*  I mean what's next? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=482.52s)]
*  Why would we stop there if they really want to get the full market share that might be available to them [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=485.52s)]
*  Maybe they could do an even little or one that babies could use in the crib [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=489.52s)]
*  Maybe they could like fire it with their feet or something [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=492.52s)]
*  The junior AR 15 the Jr 15 [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=497.52s)]
*  The Jr. AR 15 the Jr 15 for toddlers is a real thing [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=500.52s)]
*  For its part the company who makes this kid gun says the reason it's so great for kids is not only because it only weighs two pounds [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=509.52s)]
*  And is sized for little fingers and little arms and little hands [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=518.52s)]
*  But they're very hot to tell you that it has special safety features [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=522.52s)]
*  The special safety feature appears mostly to be just a second deliberately awkward safety knob on the other side of the gun from the regular safety [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=526.52s)]
*  Because surely kids won't be able to figure that one out on their own [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=534.52s)]
*  The website Snopes.com that which debunks fake things and in the news and fake things on the internet [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=539.52s)]
*  They had to do a Snopes post not long ago assuring people that no this is not a rejected plot line from the Simpsons [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=544.52s)]
*  Or from a Borat movie written to dramatize through exaggeration how insane things can get in this country [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=551.52s)]
*  No this is a real thing true is the Jr 15 a real rifle designed for children true yes [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=556.52s)]
*  It's in the news today because in the great state of Illinois where there is a pugnacious Democratic governor named JB Pritzker [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=565.52s)]
*  And a Democratic legislature in Illinois they are about to pass a new law that would ban gun marketing gun advertising [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=574.52s)]
*  That specifically markets guns to kids and this is sort of the poster child kid assault rifle for that new law [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=582.52s)]
*  Now of course they're not banning the gun itself heaven forfend we cannot do that in this country just ask the US Supreme Court [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=591.52s)]
*  But they are at least trying to ban the advertising of these assault rifles for babies [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=599.52s)]
*  California passed a law along the same lines last year now other blue states including Illinois are following suit [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=605.52s)]
*  Gun rights groups and their Republican supporters are absolutely outraged they're absolutely against any such move [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=612.52s)]
*  Why on earth would you want to limit any sort of communication or marketing targeting children with this sort of thing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=619.52s)]
*  I mean from their perspective yeah hey what could possibly go wrong [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=626.52s)]
*  To this day people don't believe me when I tell them what it is that Republicans did first the last time they got full control in Washington [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=632.52s)]
*  The last time they got control of both the White House and the Congress you remember when that was right [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=642.52s)]
*  That was the result of the 2016 election and there was so much shock and consternation over what candidate Donald Trump had said [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=649.52s)]
*  He was going to do with the presidency and what he had campaigned on there was so much shock and surprise over the election outcome [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=657.52s)]
*  Particularly at the presidential level but the election outcome was that Republicans not only got the White House they also got the House and the Senate [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=664.52s)]
*  But amid all of the consternation and shock and all of the rapid change that that portended [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=671.52s)]
*  No one remembers what they actually did with that power once they got it [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=679.52s)]
*  But it's true it is as real as the AR-15 military style assault rifle sized down for preschoolers [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=684.52s)]
*  The first substantive thing the new Republican Congress did in 2017 when they got full control in Washington [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=691.52s)]
*  Was the Republicans passed legislation that would facilitate access to firearms for people who had been formally adjudicated to be mentally ill [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=697.52s)]
*  Not just like people who seem a little off but like people who were formally adjudicated by the government to be mentally ill and unable to handle their own affairs [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=708.52s)]
*  The first thing Republicans did with full power in Washington was literally make it easier for officially crazy people to get guns [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=718.52s)]
*  To this day people still do not believe it but look it up it is true [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=727.52s)]
*  And now naturally along that same plot line now we have kid sized fully functional semi-automatic military style assault rifles that fire real bullets [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=732.52s)]
*  California last year and Illinois now are trying at the state level to at least block the marketing of those [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=743.52s)]
*  But the guns exist and gun groups and their Republican supporters are very much opposed even to trying to regulate the advertising around this new product [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=750.52s)]
*  So the pitch sounded awesome [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=761.52s)]
*  Listen to this success at ACN is not a mystery if you don't succeed ACN doesn't succeed [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=765.52s)]
*  ACN uses a model with a proven track record and it's creating millionaires [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=771.52s)]
*  ACN huh? The ACN thing that was supposed to make you a millionaire is this fantastic gizmo [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=778.52s)]
*  It is a video phone a miraculous space age invention that lets you see the person you are talking to on the phone [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=785.52s)]
*  The thing is though in order to achieve the privilege of selling this video phone gizmo you first had to pay the company $499 [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=794.52s)]
*  Then after paying them your own $500 specifically for the privilege of becoming a salesperson for them [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=804.52s)]
*  You then had to recruit other people to sell these video phones or you had to sell a whole lot of them yourself [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=810.52s)]
*  And selling them turned out to be really hard because they were not really worth buying [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=816.52s)]
*  This magic ACN video phone gizmo could only be used to call other ACN video phones [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=821.52s)]
*  So yeah you could maybe sell one to your mom if she loves you but she could not use it with anyone else unless you also sold one to your cousin or your aunt [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=829.52s)]
*  And even then they could only talk to each other but no one else who didn't have one of these things [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=838.52s)]
*  You can see why this did not take off [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=842.52s)]
*  Instead of making money selling ACN video phones most people who recruited to sell these things lost money [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=846.52s)]
*  They pumped their savings into the hefty sign up fee and then they had to buy inventory to sell and then the company also charged them for training [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=853.52s)]
*  It all added up to a lot and nobody wanted to buy these things [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=861.52s)]
*  So some of the people who felt they were duped into this no win financial black hole of a business scam [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=865.52s)]
*  They sued. They sued over this promise of getting rich that they alleged was materially false [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=872.52s)]
*  But the people who sued did not sue the company that made these phones [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=879.52s)]
*  They sued the guy who made the promise. The guy who promised them that signing up and scrimping together 500 bucks to be able to win the privilege of being allowed to sell these phones [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=885.52s)]
*  That was what would make them millionaires [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=897.52s)]
*  Success in ACN is not a mystery. If you don't succeed, ACN doesn't succeed. ACN uses a model with a proven track record and it's creating millionaires [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=902.52s)]
*  A proven track record creating millionaires [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=912.52s)]
*  Donald Trump was the pitch man for ACN video phone gizmos appearing in promotional videos where he talked about how rich you would get by selling this thing [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=916.52s)]
*  He gave paid speeches at conferences all about this thing and how you should sign up to sell it and you'd get rich [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=925.52s)]
*  He built an entire episode of his NBC show all around it [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=931.52s)]
*  There are these ACN people standing with him and his adult children while he markets this thing on NBC [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=934.52s)]
*  The people who ultimately sued him say Trump's endorsement of this product, again, for which he was being paid [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=941.52s)]
*  They say his endorsement was what got them to sign up and ultimately what lost them thousands of their own dollars [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=948.52s)]
*  The suit was first brought against Trump in 2018 when he was still president. It's just now approaching trial [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=955.52s)]
*  And I mention this because if you, like thousands of households across the country, are making a list of all these scheduled trials involving former President Donald Trump [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=961.52s)]
*  This is probably the one you keep forgetting [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=971.52s)]
*  I mean, there's the New York AG's fraud case about Trump's business that's set for trial in October [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=973.52s)]
*  There's the federal civil defamation trial brought by E. Jean Carroll that's set for January next year [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=978.52s)]
*  There's the New York criminal trial over campaign hush money payments, the Stormy Daniels thing, that criminal trial scheduled for March [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=983.52s)]
*  There's the federal criminal trial on classified documents that's slated for May in Florida [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=990.52s)]
*  There's also, of course, the federal January 6 trial which has yet to be scheduled but looks like it'll be fast [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=995.52s)]
*  But, and may we not overlook, sandwiched between the defamation case and the Manhattan criminal trial, there really is the videophone trial [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=1000.52s)]
*  The lawsuit alleging that Trump doothed people into the videophone sales scam thing as a business scam [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=1011.52s)]
*  So if you're making a chore wheel at home for deciding who's going to be the point person in your family on each of Trump's upcoming scheduled trials [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=1018.52s)]
*  If you land on videophone trial, may this be your public service announcement that that is a real thing [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=1026.52s)]
*  The New York Times [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h26fztG9FVo&t=1071.52s)]
