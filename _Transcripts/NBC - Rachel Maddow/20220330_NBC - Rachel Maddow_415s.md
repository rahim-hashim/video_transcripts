# How Ukraine Is Outperforming Russia On The Digital Battlefield
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY)
*  Joining us now is Alex Bornyakov. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=2.44s)]
*  Mr. Bornyakov, thank you for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=5.92s)]
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Pleased to be here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  I want to start by asking you some very basic things about this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  How have you managed to keep the Internet up and running despite all of the Russian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=18.16s)]
*  attacks? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=22.36s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the reason behind this is because in the first place, they wanted [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=23.36s)]
*  to, they supposed to, and they have this vision to invade Ukraine in three days. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=31.0s)]
*  So they didn't want to touch any of communication or administrative infrastructure. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=36.64s)]
*  So this gave us some time to regroup and to defend the critical parts of it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=42.82s)]
*  We have a number of services, government authorities that are in charge of this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=49.14s)]
*  One of them, and the major, it's called Special Communication Authority that basically take [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=55.02s)]
*  charge for cybersecurity defense and communication inside a country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=61.42s)]
*  So after a week or two, they realized they're not going to get this so quickly, whole Ukraine, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=65.94s)]
*  and they started to disrupt this infrastructure. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=74.26s)]
*  But we were ready. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=76.58s)]
*  Right now, in most of the territory of Ukraine, excluding war zone, of course, the communication [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=78.46s)]
*  is stable and cell reception is fine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=83.58s)]
*  The ministry for which you work, the Ministry of Digital Transformation, was not actually [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=87.96s)]
*  an agency built for war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=91.98s)]
*  It's a bureaucratic agency that is now helping modernize Ukraine. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=94.52s)]
*  How has this transition to becoming a large part of Ukraine's military response been for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=98.66s)]
*  you? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=103.62s)]
*  Well, it's because we have to act according to the realities. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=105.42s)]
*  And yeah, indeed, we completely shifted our focus from what we were doing before the war. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=112.42s)]
*  And right now, our focus is digital diplomacy or someone call this digital blockade when [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=119.14s)]
*  we really appeal to hundreds and thousands of companies, mostly like tech companies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=124.14s)]
*  We also take care of cyber defense of the country and cyber offense. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=130.94s)]
*  And we still maintain government services, which you mentioned before. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=138.14s)]
*  DIA is a government service that was installed on almost 15 million users. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=142.38s)]
*  So this app is very popular in Ukraine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=149.22s)]
*  So you can get so. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=152.74s)]
*  But again, there was new features added, like you can get government help with one click [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=154.06s)]
*  in your app. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=159.74s)]
*  If you were from war zone, you mentioned before this app that alert people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=160.74s)]
*  And right now, we also added a functionality so you can make your look for reconstruction [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=168.14s)]
*  of your damaged property and get help for the government to restore your property, which [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=178.74s)]
*  were destroyed by Russian troops. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=184.42s)]
*  I am amazed at this chat bot that you've developed so that civilians anywhere in the country [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  can report the locations of Russian troops. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=193.94s)]
*  Help us understand how you're able to confirm those reports and how helpful that tip line [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=196.54s)]
*  has been. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=201.1s)]
*  Well, it's a great question, though. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=202.1s)]
*  The thing is, the DIA, which is which was installed, installed on 15 million applications [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=205.1s)]
*  has a bank A.D. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  So it's kind of bulletproof authorization made on a two factor. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=214.54s)]
*  And so it's it's it's very powerful. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=220.98s)]
*  So we use DIA authorization in this chat bot. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=224.42s)]
*  So we make sure that there is no Russians or spies or infiltrators. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=228.06s)]
*  So DIA being essential part of this chat bot on the first on the first pace. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=234.7s)]
*  Let me ask you about the speculation at the beginning of this war that Russia would launch [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=243.66s)]
*  a large scale cyber attack against Ukraine and perhaps any anyone who helped Ukraine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=251.02s)]
*  That does not seem to have happened. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=256.86s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=258.38s)]
*  Well, who said they didn't? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=259.38s)]
*  They actually did. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=263.06s)]
*  And they instantly attacking us with a lot of incident. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=264.58s)]
*  incidents, but it appeared that their cyber offence machine or cyber cyber offence force [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=269.14s)]
*  is not so powerful as it was imagined by some experts before the war. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=277.3s)]
*  So they didn't really penetrate it, penetrate any critical part of our digital infrastructure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  But they trying they instantly trying. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=292.14s)]
*  Let's talk about the recruitment work that your ministry is doing, either crowdsourcing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=296.86s)]
*  money for Ukraine's military online and actually recruiting for the military. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  So after two days of war, we realized that National Bank of Ukraine severely limited [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=310.26s)]
*  ability of commercial banks and just regular peer to peer transfers, especially abroad. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=317.74s)]
*  So we decided to use crypto in order to fundraise. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=326.78s)]
*  This is really hectic, but we managed to partner with their private crypto exchange from Ukraine [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  called Kuna. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=336.82s)]
*  And they help us to establish the security parameters, all the exchange mechanisms. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=338.46s)]
*  So and we announced that we basically ready to get donations and form of Bitcoin, Ethereum, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=345.26s)]
*  Tether. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  And it was beyond our expectations. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  The community of the world, the crypto world community started to donate millions of dollars. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=356.42s)]
*  So we managed to raise to around 70 million dollars in crypto. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  And this is this is really what helping our army and was really helpful, especially during [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=366.06s)]
*  the first day of war, where payments and dollars in Europe were not so available like they [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=371.90000000000003s)]
*  available right now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=379.3s)]
*  It's a fascinating discussion and we appreciate you having it with us this evening. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=380.26s)]
*  Alex Bornyakov is the Ukrainian deputy minister of digital transformation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=383.86s)]
*  Mr. Bornyakov, thank you for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nvFrKCjrlY&t=388.06s)]
