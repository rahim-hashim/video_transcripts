# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 22
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc)
*  I want to start tonight by talking about some really expensive boats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=0.0s)]
*  Now the thing about buying a super yacht is that it is a pretty difficult purchase to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=5.0s)]
*  hide. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=9.76s)]
*  This one that you're looking at is called the Azam. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=11.32s)]
*  It's believed to be the largest yacht in the entire world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=14.5s)]
*  This one, the Al-Sayed, is owned by the Sultan of Oman. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=18.76s)]
*  Steven Spielberg owns a yacht. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=23.8s)]
*  His is called the Seven Seas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=25.98s)]
*  In fact, if you run down the list of the world's biggest, most lavish mansions of the sea, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=28.32s)]
*  they all have super rich, super well connected owners. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=33.16s)]
*  Heck, they all have owners, period. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=37.68s)]
*  Except for one yacht. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=41.2s)]
*  This is the Shaharazan. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=44.4s)]
*  It is more than 450 feet long. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=46.56s)]
*  It's worth more than $700 million. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=49.08s)]
*  It's got six floors, multiple swimming pools, a wood burning stove, and two helipads. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=52.76s)]
*  Because you know it's costly to keep one helicopter hovering while it waits to unload more guests. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=59.6s)]
*  It is tricked out with a piano that plays itself and a pool table that's on some kind [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  of a tilting device so it reduces the impact of the waves. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=70.08s)]
*  But the most bizarre thing about this yacht is that no one is quite sure who owns it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=74.56s)]
*  The vessel has no publicly registered owner. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=81.82000000000001s)]
*  Right now it's just chilling at a port in Italy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=85.18s)]
*  As western countries start to race, the race to round up all these super yachts that are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  owned by Russian billionaires to sanction them and seize their assets for their support [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=92.64s)]
*  of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, journalists have been trying to figure out to whom the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=98.36s)]
*  Shaharazan might belong. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=103.38s)]
*  And now, after a lot of speculation, we seem to be much closer to an answer. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=106.92s)]
*  These two Russian anti-corruption activists have just released an incredibly detailed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  report that they say proves that the owner of this mystery super yacht is not just any [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=117.58s)]
*  Russian billionaire, but Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  The activists obtained documents that show the names, the passport numbers of the crew [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  that works on this yacht. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=131.88s)]
*  Except for the captain, every single person who works on the boat is Russian, which isn't [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=133.6s)]
*  unusual in and of itself, but many of them are employed by Russia's Federal Protective [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=138.76s)]
*  Service, the FSO, which is essentially Russia's version of the Secret Service. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=144.12s)]
*  The people who staff this yacht happen to be the same people who are listed as Vladimir [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=149.88s)]
*  Putin's security guards and his personal staff. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=154.4s)]
*  Now imagine if it turned out that a mystery boat off the coast of Delaware was teaming [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=158.96s)]
*  with Secret Service agents who also happened to be on President Biden's security detail. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=163.56s)]
*  The logical assumption would be that that was Biden's boat. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the same case that these activists are making. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=175.52s)]
*  These activists have done this kind of expose before on Vladimir Putin and people close to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Take a look at the neon sign hanging behind him, behind them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  It says Navalny, as in Alexei Navalny, Russia's primary opposition leader who was poisoned [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=188.36s)]
*  and almost murdered by the Russian government. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=193.4s)]
*  Alexei Navalny is currently serving a prison sentence on bogus charges. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=196.56s)]
*  His original sentence was about three years and it was meant to expire next year. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, today, a Russian judge added nine more years to his sentence, again, based on trumped [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  up charges meant to silence him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=213.12s)]
*  This new sentence allows officials to move him to a more remote high security prison, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=215.9s)]
*  which will make it more difficult for him to communicate with his family and his lawyers [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=220.86s)]
*  and his supporters who are legion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=225.18s)]
*  And yet here are Navalny's fellow pro-democracy advocates doing the diligent work of uncovering [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=229.5s)]
*  corruption in the Russian government. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=235.94s)]
*  Because at this point, it doesn't really matter how long Putin keeps Navalny in jail. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=238.46s)]
*  These activists ended the video by saying, quote, subscribe to this channel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=244.58s)]
*  We tell the truth here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=248.06s)]
*  Free Navalny. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  What Navalny started has led legs. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=251.46s)]
*  It's got deep roots. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=253.38000000000002s)]
*  The anti-Putin anti-corruption anti-war movement in Russia is strong and growing, even with [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  its strongest leader behind bars. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=260.44s)]
*  Joining me now is Rob Lee's a former Marine Corps infantry officer and an expert on Russian [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=265.14s)]
*  defense policy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=270.1s)]
*  He's currently a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=271.58s)]
*  Mr. Lee, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=274.9s)]
*  It's good to see you this evening. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=276.5s)]
*  I want to ask you about a senior Pentagon official telling reporters today that the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=278.14s)]
*  Russian military has lost more than 10% of its combat power that was sent into Ukraine. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=282.26s)]
*  There's no indication that reinforcements are being brought in from Russia, though we [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=287.82s)]
*  do know that they've been trying to recruit people into the military. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=291.62s)]
*  Talk to me about this idea of losing 10% of your fighting force. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=296.06s)]
*  In military terms, that's actually a turning point. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=298.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's significant because Russia has not achieved its goals yet. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=302.62s)]
*  It wants to see cities. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=308.62s)]
*  It wants to circle Kiev, probably with some of the areas. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=310.22s)]
*  It wants to further degrade the Ukrainian military. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=313.54s)]
*  Every step away, Russia is facing significant attrition. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=318.38s)]
*  The more attrition they face, the more limitations they have on what kind of offensive operations [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  can they do and can they actually take big cities like Kiev, which would require additional [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=326.58s)]
*  casualties. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=329.7s)]
*  The figures we're seeing, and this is being backed up by open source information on a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=330.7s)]
*  number of destroyed or captured vehicles, all that's indicating that Russian military [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=336.46s)]
*  is going to really struggle to conduct further offensive operations for weeks and weeks at [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  a time. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  Really, they're facing a number of limitations at this point. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  The Kremlin doesn't report on how many Russian troops have died. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=352.82s)]
*  They do give out numbers, but they tend to be very low. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=355.14s)]
*  We get much higher numbers from the Ukrainian government. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=357.58s)]
*  We had a fairly sort of middle of the road estimate by U.S. intelligence. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=359.78s)]
*  But yesterday, a pro Kremlin news outlet briefly reported that nearly 10,000 Russian soldiers [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=364.82s)]
*  had been killed, and then suddenly that reference was quickly removed from the website. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=371.14s)]
*  What do we make of that? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=375.97999999999996s)]
*  These numbers sound really remarkable for a major, long-standing army like the Russian [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  army. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=383.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to tell. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=385.66s)]
*  It could be just a hack, or it could be an intelligence operation from the Ukrainians, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=387.82000000000005s)]
*  who obviously know what they're doing in terms of intelligence, or it could have been just [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=391.18s)]
*  a mistake and it was actual factual information that was published that wasn't supposed to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  be published. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=399.1s)]
*  Hard to tell, but clearly, we know the Russian military is taking heavy casualties. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=400.1s)]
*  We can see this from destroyed vehicles, from destroyed convoys, that they're clearly sustaining [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=403.42s)]
*  really heavy casualties. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=407.86s)]
*  It's significant because it's not like anything Russia has faced in the last few wars they've [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=409.1s)]
*  fought. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  In Georgia, they had a few hundred casualties, a few hundred deaths. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  In 2014-2015 Ukraine, it was only the hundreds, in Syria it was the low hundreds. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=419.94s)]
*  What they faced after a week in Ukraine this time was greater than the last three wars [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=424.62s)]
*  combined. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=429.42s)]
*  That was weeks ago, and now the figures are obviously much greater. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=431.42s)]
*  Even if that figure, I don't know the veracity of it, but it's probably somewhere in the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=435.34s)]
*  ballpark of what the actual casualty figures are. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=440.7s)]
*  We talk about that, but it's a substantial share of the Russian invasion force. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=443.94s)]
*  Again, that kind of attrition, it really affects what Russia can do at this point, because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=447.29999999999995s)]
*  it limits the goals it can achieve. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=451.29999999999995s)]
*  Let me ask you about air support and air force. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=454.29999999999995s)]
*  The Ukrainians do have an air force. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=459.5s)]
*  They do have trained pilots. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=460.97999999999996s)]
*  The New York Times has some interesting reporting about the Ukrainian air force and how it's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=462.62s)]
*  operating in quote what the Times says, near total secrecy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  One of the pilots they spoke to said, quote, in every fight with Russian jets there's no [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=470.18s)]
*  equality. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=474.1s)]
*  They always have five times more planes. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=475.1s)]
*  And despite being outnumbered, Ukrainian pilots have been successful at preventing wider bombings. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=477.3s)]
*  They've intercepted some missiles. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=482.70000000000005s)]
*  Talk to me about this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=484.38s)]
*  They are vastly outnumbered by Russian jets. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=485.38s)]
*  How is it, what's the outlook for the air force in Ukraine? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=487.74s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=491.86s)]
*  It's not fully known. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=495.18s)]
*  It's kind of hard to tell from these open sources exactly what they're doing, and partially [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=496.18s)]
*  because I think they want it that way. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=499.46000000000004s)]
*  But clearly they're still operating and clearly they're making life difficult for Russia. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=500.98s)]
*  Then in terms of an invasion for Russia, they want to have air supremacy where they can [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=504.18s)]
*  have fighter aircraft, bomber aircraft operating over Ukrainian forces at all times, being [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=508.94s)]
*  able to bomb them, do reconnaissance, all those kind of things. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  And they clearly can't do that effectively right now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=516.86s)]
*  I think part of that is because Ukraine's air defenses are still intact. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=519.14s)]
*  And part of that is because the Ukrainian air force is still operating and still contesting [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=522.22s)]
*  the environment. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=526.3399999999999s)]
*  So all of that makes it more difficult for the Russian air force. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  And a really key part of this is that interdiction missions, the really key mission that the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=529.18s)]
*  Russian air force would like to take part in, that would include preventing the Ukrainians [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=534.3399999999999s)]
*  from reinforcing locations, from resupplying cities, all those kind of things. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  And it's cool they're not really able to do that very effectively. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=542.42s)]
*  Again, this is probably likely part of this is because the Ukrainian air force is still [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=545.5s)]
*  operating and still making the environment contested and making life difficult for the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=549.26s)]
*  Russian air force, which is still, part of the reason why Ukraine is resisting still [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=553.18s)]
*  today and why they're still having success. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=557.1s)]
*  Rob, thank you for your analysis. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=562.02s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=563.46s)]
*  Rob Lee is a former Marine Corps infantry officer. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=564.46s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=567.6999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Janai Nelson, president and director, council of the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=570.2199999999999s)]
*  and Education Fund. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=575.7399999999999s)]
*  Ms. Nelson, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=577.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm puzzled by Senator Graham and Senator John Cornyn of Texas's line of questioning [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=580.38s)]
*  today, which was asking Judge Jackson to offer her opinions about the treatment and the process [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=586.78s)]
*  that other black jurists went through. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=592.8599999999999s)]
*  What's the point of a line of questioning like that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=596.18s)]
*  It was seemed to be the playbook for many of the Republican senators during the hearing, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=600.18s)]
*  and that was to air their grievances about either previous hearings or about other potential [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=605.7399999999999s)]
*  nominees that they perhaps would have supported more than they support the very eminently [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=612.38s)]
*  qualified Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=618.04s)]
*  Either way, it was an appalling display of disrespect to ask her to opine on the treatment [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=620.38s)]
*  of other black women in the process. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=627.9s)]
*  In many ways, it was pitting black women against one another and asking her to offer her opinion [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=630.5s)]
*  about the treatment or the vetting process that she really had no responsibility for [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=636.8199999999999s)]
*  and that they wrongly characterized as an assault on these two individuals. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=642.62s)]
*  However, it turned out in terms of whether they moved forward or didn't had nothing to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=647.86s)]
*  qualifications of Katanji Brown Jackson, which was the only subject that was relevant at [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=653.7s)]
*  today's hearing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=658.9000000000001s)]
*  So what we saw was a very nasty exercise in trying to create a foment discord among professional, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=659.9000000000001s)]
*  highly qualified women, black women who should not be maligned in any way. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=670.9000000000001s)]
*  And it was very disappointing to see them try to play that tactic and certainly inappropriate [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=675.5400000000001s)]
*  for a hearing of this sort. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=681.34s)]
*  Let me ask you about Senator Ted Cruz's decision to ask her, ask Judge Jackson about a reference [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=685.1s)]
*  to Nicole Hannah Jones piece of journalism called the 1619 Project. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  He was he was holding up books from a Georgetown school on which she's a board, a private school [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=697.02s)]
*  on which she's a member of the board. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=703.06s)]
*  And he was sort of trying to pin her down on critical race theory. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=705.06s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about what you observed in that exchange. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=708.9s)]
*  Yeah, it seems that he thought we would all be impressed by the theater of it all and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=713.34s)]
*  the props that he brought in to try to link her to the 1619 Project and to the to the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=717.66s)]
*  renowned, acclaimed, award winning journalist and I should say, LDF client Nicole Hannah [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=725.42s)]
*  Jones. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=730.7s)]
*  I think that Judge Jackson explained quite clearly why she referenced the 1619 Project [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=732.02s)]
*  because it is part of the zeitgeist around issues of race currently. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=739.26s)]
*  And she raised it in a speech to students who would clearly be interested in it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=744.1800000000001s)]
*  We know that the 1619 Project is a is a very popular project and text because of the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=748.46s)]
*  number one Times bestseller list that is occupied at the front, the forefront for many [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=756.26s)]
*  weeks. So she she mentioned it in a speech. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=761.14s)]
*  She referenced the author or the the the actual organizer of the project, Nicole Hannah [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=763.46s)]
*  Jones. But that has nothing to do again with her qualifications as a judge. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=769.34s)]
*  It has nothing to do with any of the decisions that she wrote or any of the judgments that [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=774.5s)]
*  she's issued or any of her professional work. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=780.14s)]
*  Now, it's not to say that it's off limits to question someone's speech or oratory or [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=783.78s)]
*  writings outside of their judicial background. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=788.94s)]
*  But to ascribe a negative intention to it or to ascribe a particular viewpoint to it [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=792.46s)]
*  was, again, beyond the pale and completely unjustified. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=798.82s)]
*  What we saw today was an attempt to assail the character of Katanji Brown, Katanji Brown [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=803.7800000000001s)]
*  Jackson, because her record itself is so wholly unassailable. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=809.94s)]
*  They're grasping at straws. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=814.1400000000001s)]
*  They're trying to find some way to make her look less than qualified, and they failed [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=815.5s)]
*  miserably. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Eawkw_4qc&t=820.14s)]
