# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 27
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg)
*  Here's the letter Arizona's Secretary of State writing to the person who sent in that fake electors document saying number one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=0.0s)]
*  Stop using the state seal. It's illegal and number two [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=7.32s)]
*  We're refute referring you to the Attorney General's office for potential prosecution the following day on December 23rd [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=10.44s)]
*  We've got the Secretary of State making that formal criminal referral to the AG's office and it is a very straightforward thing [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=17.02s)]
*  We received these documents from these Arizona residents [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=23.38s)]
*  Proporting to be official state documents using the official state seal. These were not real official documents [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=27.6s)]
*  Use of the state seal by anybody not authorized to use it is a crime in Arizona. Here's all the material [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=34.28s)]
*  This is a crime. Please proceed. Mr. Attorney General [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=40.04s)]
*  That formal criminal referral was made to the Arizona Attorney General's office December 23rd, 2020. So more than a year ago [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=44.72s)]
*  since then [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=52.8s)]
*  nothing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=54.64s)]
*  So there's two questions here [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  One of them is about the federal cops on the beat here, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Why did federal investigators at the National Archives only open an investigation into one of the two fake slates of electors? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  They received from Arizona [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=70.66s)]
*  Sure, that one came in first but a few days later when a second set of fake elector documents came in from Arizona and from [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=72.56s)]
*  a bunch of other states [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=79.28s)]
*  Why wasn't a federal investigation launched into those as well or was it? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=81.28s)]
*  We are trying to find out we will let you know as soon as we have figured it out [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=86.68s)]
*  But also in this situation in Arizona [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=91.12s)]
*  I mean again [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  They had two fake electors slates from two different sets of Republicans in Arizona and this one with the state seal on it was kind [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=94.76s)]
*  of a special case [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=100.72s)]
*  Kind of an open and shut case using the state seal on your forged document is its own crime [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=102.08s)]
*  And here's the Secretary of State's office saying hi Attorney General crime here, please prosecute [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  That was over a year ago so far nothing what happened with this at the Attorney General's office in Arizona [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=113.38s)]
*  Why did this dead end there? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=119.86s)]
*  Well, let's turn to local journalists in Arizona to see what they think [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  Laurie Roberts writing this week for the Arizona Republic quote anyone waiting breathlessly for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=128.66s)]
*  Attorney General Mark Bernovich to launch an investigation into the fake Trump electors who participated in a scheme to overturn Arizona's vote [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=133.7s)]
*  Should wait no longer [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Bernovich's latest fundraising plea makes it abundantly clear that he has no intention of actually doing his job [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  And then she shows this recent fundraising gambit from the Arizona Attorney General [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Are you really going to ignore President Trump? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  We thought he could count on you Bernovich says and this fundraiser making the making the rounds to Republicans on Facebook quote [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=156.2s)]
*  This is your last chance to help flip Arizona and take back the Senate. Don't miss your chance to be on Trump's team [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=162.76s)]
*  Laurie Roberts continues quote set aside for a second that this fundraising plea is a blatant misrepresentation of the truth Trump hasn't [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Endorsed Bernovich in Arizona and in fact Trump threw a fundraiser for one of Bernovich's opponents [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=178.76s)]
*  Bernovich is in a crowded Republican race for this Senate seat a race in which every candidate is competing to be anointed by Trump for [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  The job but Trump has not endorsed anyone in that Senate race [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=191.28s)]
*  Bernovich should be investigating the phony Trump electors who in December 2020 signed a document [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=195.32s)]
*  Avowing that they represented the true electoral votes from Arizona [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=200.44s)]
*  They sent it by registered mail to the US Senate and the National Archives [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=204.12s)]
*  Fortunately federal investigators are now looking into it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=208.56s)]
*  But shouldn't the state's prosecutor have at least a passing interest in such a blatant scheme carried out right under his nose [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=211.22s)]
*  Roberts continues quote it seems painfully clear that you can't be both the Attorney General of Arizona [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=218.72s)]
*  In charge of investigating all aspects of the 2020 election and a US Senate candidate who was chasing Trump's endorsement [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=224.12s)]
*  At least you shouldn't be the conflict of interest is oh so clearly evident in Bernovich's latest fundraising plea [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  Bernovich's heart may lie with Trump, but his obligation remains to the people of Arizona [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  He should resign [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  That's from the Arizona Republic today [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=247.8s)]
*  Calls for the Arizona Attorney General to resign if among other things he's not going to prosecute the state's fake electors [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  And I'm I'm you know not close enough to Arizona politics to know about the likelihood of any resignation here [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=257.6s)]
*  I'm guessing that's not going to happen [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=263.12s)]
*  But if you're wondering why there's a need for a federal investigation if you're wondering why the US Justice Department now says they are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=264.2s)]
*  investigating well [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  This kind of mishegasm the states might help explain why that's needed. I [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=273.52s)]
*  Mean in this case no action for more than a year even in the most clear-cut [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=277.92s)]
*  Imaginable case where state law was definitely for sure no doubt about it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=283.32s)]
*  broken [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=288.48s)]
*  So here's the statement. It's from the Russian Embassy Russia's Embassy in the nation of Ireland [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=290.24s)]
*  quote any attempts to interfere with military exercises would be a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  reckless and irresponsible act which could put in harm's way both sailors and fishermen [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=299.36s)]
*  What it really was was a warning for these guys [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  Fishermen from County Cork who say they plan to disrupt Russia's war games exercises next week [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=309.38000000000005s)]
*  Which are scheduled to take place in the waters where they fish where they make their living [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  To say these fishermen are undeterred by the Russian government's statement about those war games [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=319.66s)]
*  That would be an understatement [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=325.38000000000005s)]
*  Listen to this [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=327.38000000000005s)]
*  Are you aware of that that the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=330.1s)]
*  Russian Embassy said when the Russian Embassy is saying your behavior is reckless [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=332.54s)]
*  How is it reckless to go out in a boat and protest peacefully to say we you are not welcome in our waters? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=337.26000000000005s)]
*  How is that reckless? They're saying it's not you're reckless [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=344.74s)]
*  But I'm not even gonna I'm not even going to entertain any Russian Embassy or any ambassador whatsoever [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=347.62s)]
*  Joe I'll tell you this is directly to that gentleman there [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  But if anybody tries to impede my freedom of movement in Irish waters [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=356.86s)]
*  Well, they're international and they're gonna be in trouble. They're gonna be in trouble [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=362.26000000000005s)]
*  I come back to the statement from the Russian ambassador. He said I have no relationship with the Russian ambassador [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=364.86s)]
*  I know that I know I'm a free citizen in Ireland. He has no authority over me and I take his threat as an insult [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, he wouldn't he would that's my answer to him. Okay, that's my answer to the Russian ambassador of Ireland [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=377.3s)]
*  I take his his threat as an insult and he should withdraw it I [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=383.1s)]
*  Take his threat as an insult and he should withdraw it [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=390.3s)]
*  Yesterday the Russian Embassy in Ireland [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=396.98s)]
*  Invited the cork fishermen to come visit to come to their embassy in Dublin and meet with the Russian ambassador to try to talk this [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=399.74s)]
*  Out the fishermen agreed to take the meeting had I been them. I'm not sure I would have but they went [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=406.38s)]
*  The head of the cork fisherman's organization offered this preview of what he planned to tell the ambassador when he sat down with him face to face [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=412.7s)]
*  Is it a fishing ground or is it a fire? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=421.5s)]
*  What can the Russian ambassador say to you in the morning that will make you call off your floatilla? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=424.82s)]
*  We're not calling off her floatilla. We're going out there to fish Joe [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=429.82s)]
*  What are you gonna say to the Russian and I'm going to explain that to the Russian ambassador [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=436.62s)]
*  This is where we fish. This is where we prosecute a fishery and this is where we're going to fish [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=440.58s)]
*  We're hoping that if they're going to carry out an exercise [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=444.74s)]
*  They will keep a safe distance from us not the other way around and if they feel that they need to come into our area [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=447.5s)]
*  Where we're fishing our protest is we're not moving [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=453.74s)]
*  Our protest is we're not moving [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=457.02s)]
*  This small group of Irish fishermen, of course [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=461.02s)]
*  They are not the only people in the world who are upset with Russia right now [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=464.09999999999997s)]
*  Right as Russia uses its military to menace Europe, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=467.54s)]
*  But as far as Russia's military exercises around the edges of that threat go [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=471.82s)]
*  It does seem like these fishermen in Ireland are the only ones who are actually doing anything about it [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=477.38s)]
*  This is what the head of the fisherman's organization told the local press in Cork [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=482.5s)]
*  He said quote it is a bit funny that it's up to us [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=485.98s)]
*  But we will take the opportunity to represent our fishermen at whatever level and whatever way we can [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=488.86s)]
*  Well today two representatives from the Irish fishermen did travel from Cork to Dublin to go meet with the Russian ambassador to Ireland [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=495.22s)]
*  They met at the embassy the meeting lasted a little under an hour and by early accounts [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=503.12s)]
*  They said the meeting went well the fishermen came outside after their meeting [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=507.70000000000005s)]
*  They told the press gathered outside the embassy that they felt the ambassador took their concerns seriously [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  They said they felt understood by him [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=515.22s)]
*  They said they came to a compromise an agreement that Russia would create a sort of buffer zone between the fishing grounds and their [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=516.98s)]
*  War games basically an agreement to share the waters out there next week [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=524.5799999999999s)]
*  So everybody can do their jobs and no one will get hurt will all coexist [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=528.5799999999999s)]
*  The fishermen said Russia gave them a quote [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=532.2199999999999s)]
*  Absolute guarantee that their fishing grounds would not be disrupted by Russia's military exercises [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  The embassy even put out this photo of the two fishermen with the ambassador see everybody's getting along everything's fine now an [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=542.86s)]
*  absolute guarantee [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=550.26s)]
*  But [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=552.38s)]
*  Well, I mean [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=554.38s)]
*  Here's these fishermen right? Why is it up to them to negotiate the terms of the Russian Navy's military exercises? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=556.38s)]
*  And could the Russian government really be dealing with these guys in good faith about this? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=563.38s)]
*  Expressing what the limits will be what the buffer zones will be the guarantee. They're giving them about not disrupting anything [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=568.22s)]
*  I mean, I believe the fishermen when they say the ambassador gave them an absolute guarantee that the fishing grounds would not be disrupted [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=573.7s)]
*  I believe that the ambassador told them that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=580.4599999999999s)]
*  But then of course once the fishermen came out of the embassy and said that publicly the Russians claimed that no such thing had happened [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=583.4599999999999s)]
*  This is the headline in the Irish Times quote Russian Embassy disputes claims of absolute guarantee to Irish fishermen on naval exercise impact [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=591.14s)]
*  These fishermen are fishermen they are not trained diplomats [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=601.54s)]
*  Russia appears to be trying to take advantage of that, you know immediately reneging on whatever promises [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=606.2199999999999s)]
*  They may have fed these guys in the room today. So they're yanking these guys chains [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=610.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they feel like oh these guys are just fishermen who cares [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=614.42s)]
*  You know all week as we have been covering the story this back and forth between one of the most powerful navies on earth and these [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=619.6999999999999s)]
*  Fishermen one thing has stayed constant. These guys are very clear. They are not going to budge [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=625.3399999999999s)]
*  Russia's military exercises are simply a matter of time [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=632.06s)]
*  Russia's military exercises are supposed to start on Thursday next week. The fishermen say hey the prawn quota opens up on Tuesday [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=634.9s)]
*  So we're gonna be out there on the water doing our jobs starting on Tuesday and we're not planning on moving not for you [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=641.78s)]
*  We shall see [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=649.94s)]
*  One other thing to know about dr [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  Latipo is that he has not actually yet been confirmed in this post as [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=654.6s)]
*  Florida's surgeon general governor DeSantis put him up for the job months ago [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=659.4200000000001s)]
*  And he's been essentially functioning as Florida's surgeon general for the last several months [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  But he does ultimately have to be confirmed by the state Senate in Florida [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=668.3s)]
*  yesterday, he appeared before the Florida Senate for his confirmation hearing and it it was [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=673.4599999999999s)]
*  It was it was something [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=679.62s)]

*  Thank you, thank you senator I [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=697.14s)]
*  Consider vaccines in the same way that I consider other medical therapies [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=700.34s)]
*  What we care about clinically is whether they are safe and effective and that is the lens through which I evaluate all [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=706.1s)]
*  medical therapies [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=714.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  Vaccines in fighting against a pandemic like kovat 19 are effective [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=718.4599999999999s)]
*  You recognize [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=726.06s)]

*  so [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=731.8199999999999s)]
*  again, I would I would say that that the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=733.06s)]
*  The question is a scientific one and it's one that is answered with data. So [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=736.78s)]
*  so the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=742.06s)]
*  the [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=744.18s)]

*  specific outcomes and specific [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=752.3399999999999s)]
*  Specific therapies so that's I that's the that's the scientific question. Mr. Chair [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=755.9799999999999s)]
*  Just a couple more following just a yes or no [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=761.78s)]
*  Do vaccines work in fighting against kovat 19? Yes or no? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=765.3s)]

*  Senator I [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=773.3s)]
*  just I [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=774.9399999999999s)]
*  as a scientist, you know, I I [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=776.3399999999999s)]
*  I'm compelled to answer the scientific question and I'd be happy to answer [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=779.74s)]
*  Any specific scientific question that you have? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=786.02s)]
*  related to vaccines and kovat 19 [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=789.62s)]
*  Scientifically do vaccines does the do the vaccines work against preventing kovat 19? Yes or no? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=792.5799999999999s)]
*  Recognized, okay. Oh, thank you again senator. So [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=800.38s)]
*  You know, it's yes or no questions are are not that that easy to find in science [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=804.54s)]
*  That's the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=812.86s)]
*  Democratic leader of the Florida State Senate senator lauren book [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=814.06s)]
*  struggling valiantly to try to get an answer out of [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=818.14s)]
*  Governor ron de santis's hand-picked surgeon general for the state of florida [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=822.3s)]
*  Senator book and her democratic colleagues ultimately got up and walked out of that hearing saying that they were fed up with dr [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=826.14s)]
*  Latipo's refusal to offer any answers to any questions [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=833.66s)]
*  After that confirmation hearing the Florida Sun Sentinel published this response from the paper's editorial board [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=838.62s)]
*  Quote Joseph Latipo and his contrived evasiveness must go quote. Dr. Joseph Latipo is an expert. All right [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=845.66s)]
*  He's masterful at dodging questions [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=851.42s)]
*  Is an expert. All right [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=853.5s)]
*  He's masterful at dodging questions insulting the intelligence of floridians and avoiding straight talk about the need to be vaccinated against kovat 19 [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=854.62s)]
*  I'm married to data latipo told senators [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=862.2199999999999s)]
*  The reality is that he's married to governor de santis's agenda to politicize the pandemic [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=864.62s)]
*  The doctor does not deserve to be confirmed as surgeon general [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=869.9s)]
*  Especially now that he has shown that he has so little respect for the people of florida that he wouldn't give them straight and straight answers [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=873.02s)]
*  through their senators [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=879.18s)]
*  I mean [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=880.86s)]
*  There are a lot of debates around the kovat 19 pandemic and our response to it and effective policies and right right [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=882.62s)]
*  And some of those debates are absolutely worthwhile [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=889.98s)]
*  It is after all a novel a novel coronavirus [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=892.06s)]
*  And so therefore we learn more about it scientifically as we move on in time and we live with it for longer [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=895.5s)]
*  Some of those debates are absolutely worthwhile, but some of them are ridiculous [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=902.54s)]
*  And on the question of do the vaccines work, I don't know [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=907.02s)]
*  I don't know seniors who are vaxxed are 50 times [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=910.54s)]
*  Less likely to be hospitalized with kovat than seniors who aren't [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=914.9399999999999s)]
*  50 times [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=919.18s)]
*  That's not statistically significant enough for you. I mean not to be weird, but even donald trump says the vaccines work [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=921.66s)]
*  the vaccines work [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=928.9399999999999s)]
*  But the surgeon general of florida [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=931.9s)]
*  Cannot bring himself to say that that is apparently a bridge too far for that state's top doctor [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=934.86s)]
*  This week governor de santis unleashed this furious tirade against the biden administration [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=939.02s)]
*  Blasting president biden and the administration for stopping shipments of two monoclonal antibody treatments for kovat [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=943.5799999999999s)]
*  Governor de santis called that a sudden and reckless decision and accused the biden administration of basically killing people [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=950.78s)]
*  Blocking life-saving treatments. He said he's going to fight back against this decision [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=957.8s)]
*  What is so strange about this explosion of rage from federal government? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=962.38s)]
*  About this explosion of rage from florida's governor ron de santis is that the reason the federal government stopped sending those two particular [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=966.86s)]
*  monoclonal antibody treatments to florida and all the other states in the country [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=974.52s)]
*  Is that those two monoclonal antibodies? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=978.62s)]
*  Do not work [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=981.26s)]
*  against the omicron variant [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=983.02s)]
*  Those two monoclonal antibodies have been a fantastic treatment for previous variants of kovat [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=986.22s)]
*  They have saved lots and lots of lives, but they do not work against omicron [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=992.14s)]
*  Omicron is mutated in such a way that it is not susceptible to those treatments [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=996.78s)]
*  The drug makers themselves say they have done the tests and those monoclonal antibody treatments don't work against omicron and omicron now makes up [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1002.22s)]
*  99 percent of new cases of kovat across the country including florida. You do not have to be a chemist to understand this [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1009.56s)]
*  It is not that hard to understand if you are four years old and listening to me right now [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1016.86s)]
*  You probably understand what I just said [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1021.66s)]
*  There is one monoclonal antibody from glasso smith kline that does still work against omicron [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1024.62s)]
*  That drug is unfortunately in very short supply right now and they're struggling to make more of it as fast as they can [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1030.62s)]
*  But from those other two companies from regeneron and eli lily their antibody treatments [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1036.3799999999999s)]
*  While they worked on earlier iterations of the coronavirus. They do not work on the current one again. This is easy [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1040.86s)]
*  This is not even like math [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1046.3799999999999s)]
*  This is like counting on your fingers territory [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1048.3s)]
*  But in florida they apparently cannot get that [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1051.1000000000001s)]
*  Even before today all this month [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1055.74s)]
*  Governor ron de santos has been on this kick about how many antibody treatment centers he's opened and how many doses of regeneron [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1058.06s)]
*  The one that doesn't work against omicron how many doses of regeneron he has managed to secure for floridians and how the biden administration [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1066.22s)]
*  Hasn't been sending enough and he's demanding more [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1072.3s)]
*  He has been doing this even though it has been clear for weeks now that these treatments don't work against omicron [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1074.3s)]
*  Variant and the omicron variant has taken over [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1079.34s)]
*  A week ago the daily beast summed it up with this accurate headline ron de santos opens antibody centers that are useless against omicron [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1083.58s)]
*  And governor de santos's surgeon general joseph latopo has chimed in too saying we should not just listen to people [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1092.06s)]
*  Labeled as experts on these matters. He says he will personally continue using those antibody treatments on patients with omicron [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1098.6999999999998s)]
*  Even though they are proven not to work against omicron [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1106.14s)]
*  It is such a weird fight to pick right now in florida under the leadership of ron de santos and and joe latopo [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1111.18s)]
*  Florida is insisting that as a state government [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1118.8600000000001s)]
*  They're going to do nothing to mitigate the spread of covid whatsoever and worse than that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1121.3400000000001s)]
*  They will continue to spread doubt and misinformation about both vaccines and masks [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1125.5800000000002s)]
*  But they also insist they must be allowed to continue to give us information about the spread of covid [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1130.3000000000002s)]
*  Must be allowed to continue to give people monoclonal antibodies that literally do not work against the omicron variant [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1134.54s)]
*  Which is covid now? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1142.3s)]
*  We are two years into this pandemic this is what passes for pandemic policy in our third most populous state [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1147.6599999999999s)]
*  And as I said republican politics are in such a state right now that what happens in florida tends to spread to other red [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1155.98s)]
*  States as soon as it gets featured on fox news or whatever [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1161.6599999999999s)]
*  So [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1165.02s)]
*  Dr latopo's confirmation process to become officially the surgeon general of florida [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1168.06s)]
*  It is still not complete in florida. He's due before the ethics committee in the state legislature there as early as next week [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1172.46s)]
*  perhaps at that next round of confirmation hearing somebody will ask him about [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1179.1s)]
*  His nonsensical [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgitYc-Augg&t=1183.6599999999999s)]
