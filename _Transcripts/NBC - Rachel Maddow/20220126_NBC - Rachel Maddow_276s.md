# Despite His Best Efforts, Breyer Unable To Avoid Politics Of His Retirement
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ)
*  Joining us now is our friend Dahlia Lithwick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  She is senior editor and legal correspondent at Slate.com. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=2.24s)]
*  Her article today about Stephen Breyer's retirement [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=5.44s)]
*  is titled, The Deep Irony of Stephen Breyer's Bear-Knuckled [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=8.16s)]
*  Exit from the Supreme Court. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=12.56s)]
*  I think about Stephen Breyer in a lot of different ways. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I never, ever think about his knuckles, bear or otherwise. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=17.88s)]
*  Dahlia, it's great to see you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=22.32s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=23.32s)]
*  It's good to be here on a day, Rachel, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=25.0s)]
*  when everybody's a little giddy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  It's so rare, I feel, to have from the roses to the chuckling. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=29.0s)]
*  It's nice to have good news. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=33.52s)]
*  Well, it's also like, you know, it's history. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=36.12s)]
*  I get like this about State of the Union and stuff like this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=38.8s)]
*  There's just some things, at least from the news business [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=41.64s)]
*  part of it, like we're about to get a Supreme Court nominee. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=44.44s)]
*  Like, if you're lucky, that happens one time in your career [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=47.6s)]
*  when you have the honor and the responsibility [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  of getting to cover the news. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=52.68s)]
*  It's always a huge deal, whether you love the nominee [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=54.04s)]
*  or you don't. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=56.64s)]
*  But this is a big deal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=58.16s)]
*  This is varsity level news. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  And it's thrilling. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=61.76s)]
*  And it's also, I have to say, it's a pleasure [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=63.72s)]
*  to be able to cover this knowing that Stephen Breyer, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=67.2s)]
*  Justice Breyer, has chosen to leave on his own terms. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=69.84s)]
*  We're not covering him because he passed away, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  or we're not covering because he was forced out [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=75.64s)]
*  in some difficult circumstances. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=77.56s)]
*  It does seem like he left on his own terms. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=78.8s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=82.8s)]
*  I will say I'm a little sad for him, Rachel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=84.08s)]
*  And I know we've talked about it a bunch. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=87.36s)]
*  And I've said, even on this show, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=89.56s)]
*  there's no point in asking Justice Breyer if judges [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=92.92s)]
*  are partisan and political because it's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=96.28s)]
*  like asking the Easter Bunny if there's such a thing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=98.16s)]
*  as the Easter Bunny. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=100.64s)]
*  He believes so deeply in this notion [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=101.72s)]
*  that the justices are not partisan, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  that the court is something bigger, something better [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=109.0s)]
*  than that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  And in a weird way, there's a quality of this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=113.76s)]
*  that is so aspirational and elegiac at the same time [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=118.0s)]
*  that in a weird, and I guess that's my white knuckle [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=122.92s)]
*  reference in my piece, but in a weird, weird way, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=125.44s)]
*  because he's pulling the rip cord, he's doing it early. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=128.84s)]
*  This is a very political move to give the Biden White [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=131.8s)]
*  House an opportunity to fill this seat before any shenanigans, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=135.8s)]
*  as you and Senator Klobuchar talked about, could happen. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=140.28s)]
*  The signaling almost feels like he's giving up [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=144.32s)]
*  on that aspiration that he has pushed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  in the face of relentless pressure. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=150.64s)]
*  Just admit it, Justice Breyer, it's all just a game of politics. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=153.36s)]
*  You're a football step down. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=157.96s)]
*  And the harder he was pushed on that, Rachel, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=160.36s)]
*  the more he dug in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=162.76s)]
*  And so there's a part of me that feels [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=164.16s)]
*  as though the ideas he stood for, and Nina talked about this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  so eloquently, about bipartisanship, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=171.56s)]
*  about cooperating, about not glomming onto the credit, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=174.4s)]
*  letting someone else look good, getting results. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  These deep friendships he had with Justice Scalia, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=180.96s)]
*  with Justice O'Connor, it feels like all that just detonated [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=183.84s)]
*  around him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=187.4s)]
*  And so he's standing there kind of with this, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=188.16s)]
*  womp, womp, it's really not partisan, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=190.8s)]
*  at the same time that he is making [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=193.0s)]
*  a really partisan retirement move. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=195.16s)]
*  Those values that you just talked about, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=198.84s)]
*  do you think that the justice in retiring [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=201.08s)]
*  in his meeting at the White House tomorrow [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=204.16s)]
*  with President Biden, that he'll try to shape [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  the choice of his successor [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=209.68s)]
*  towards somebody with those same values? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't think he would ever say anything of the sort, Rachel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=214.84s)]
*  I think he would think it's unseemly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  And he often would talk about, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=219.92s)]
*  he doesn't have any opinions on judicial nomination. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=223.6s)]
*  I think he would describe it as asking a chicken [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=226.96s)]
*  for its recipe for chicken a la king, which don't even, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=230.0s)]
*  I don't know what it means. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=233.32s)]
*  But I think he just didn't think it was appropriate [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=234.68s)]
*  to talk deeply about those kinds of political things. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=236.8s)]
*  But at the same time, I do think he really, really values [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=240.6s)]
*  the idea that the person who follows him [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=246.24s)]
*  will look at the court in this kind of mystical, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=248.72s)]
*  oracular way, even if that's a disappearing value. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjwlQomdHDQ&t=252.28s)]
