# New details of the conditions in ICE detainment centers in Louisiana exposed by Congressional visit
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ)
*  I told the vice president of El Salvador that I may be the first senator member of Congress [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to be in El Salvador, to come down to El Salvador, but I won't be the last. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=6.28s)]
*  Maryland U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, after returning from El Salvador just a few days [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=13.64s)]
*  ago, during that trip he was able to meet with Kilmar Obrego Garcia, the man the administration [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=18.2s)]
*  sent to a Salvadoran prison because of what they called an administrative error. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  They have since been refusing to get him back despite courts essentially telling him that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=26.76s)]
*  they must. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=30.92s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen said when he was on that trip to El Salvador that other members of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=32.64s)]
*  Congress would be coming behind him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=35.82s)]
*  You saw him there say upon his return, I may be the first, but I won't be the last. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=37.64s)]
*  He has turned out to be right about that in more ways than one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=42.92s)]
*  And this is interesting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=46.08s)]
*  Yesterday we saw four Democratic members of Congress, four up and coming young Democrats, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=47.08s)]
*  Robert Garcia, Maxwell Frost, Maxine Dexter and Yasemin Ansari, all themselves traveled [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=52.56s)]
*  to El Salvador to demand answers about the people Trump has sent to that country to be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=57.52s)]
*  held potentially forever in that Salvadoran prison. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  But we're also seeing other Democratic members of Congress show up on this issue, bodily [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=67.08s)]
*  show up in other ways as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=70.72s)]
*  We've talked on this show about the case of a man named Moshe Madawi. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  He's a legal permanent resident. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=76.28s)]
*  He's got a green card. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=77.64s)]
*  He was summoned to appear for his citizenship test to take the final step to becoming a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=78.94s)]
*  citizen. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=84.34s)]
*  They then arrested him when he turned up for that test. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=85.34s)]
*  His friends had feared that something like that might happen to him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=89.3s)]
*  Mr. Madawi's friends in Vermont, they had made plans to respond in case he was taken. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=92.86s)]
*  That's why we have footage of them taking him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  They had lined up legal representation for him, made a communications plan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=100.66s)]
*  They basically strategized about the best ways to support Mr. Madawi of Trump's agents [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=104.1s)]
*  and in fact came and got him, which they did. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  Since his arrest, Vermonters have been protesting outside the immigration jail where he's being [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=111.42s)]
*  held. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=115.74s)]
*  And now Vermont's junior U.S. Senator, Peter Welch, has showed up bodily to go meet with [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=117.3s)]
*  him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  He showed up at that immigration jail to meet with his constituent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  How is your state so positive despite your circumstances? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=128.38s)]
*  Thank you for the visit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=131.74s)]
*  It really means a lot and it reassures me of the support that I have from you and from [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=135.18s)]
*  the Vermonters as well, my people, the people of Vermont. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm staying positive by reassuring myself in the inevitability of justice and in the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  deep belief of democracy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=153.94s)]
*  The reason Senator Peter Welch was able to visit his constituent, Mr. Madawi in Vermont, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=157.86s)]
*  is because there was that swift reaction to Mr. Madawi's arrest that allowed for very [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=163.66s)]
*  fast legal intervention in which a court was able to stop the Trump administration from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=168.54s)]
*  taking him out of Vermont and shipping him to another state. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  Most other people have not been as lucky. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=177.18s)]
*  Many of the other people who have been snatched off the street by Trump's agents have been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=178.9s)]
*  shipped to other immigration prisons like the ones they've got set up in Louisiana. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=182.38s)]
*  That includes people like Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student who had a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=187.78s)]
*  green card. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=191.3s)]
*  He was arrested by ICE and imprisoned and slated for deportation because he participated [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=192.34s)]
*  in campus protests. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=199.22s)]
*  Also in a Louisiana immigration prison is Rumeysa Ozturk, the PhD student and Fulbright [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=201.18s)]
*  scholar who was snatched off the street in Massachusetts by masked agents who then stuffed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=206.58s)]
*  her into an unmarked car. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  They flew her to multiple immigration prisons and jails before sending her ultimately to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=213.3s)]
*  Louisiana as well. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  Well today, yet another group of Democratic members of Congress and senators decided to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  bodily show up and try to do something about this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=225.42s)]
*  They went to Louisiana to go meet with Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, among others. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=228.38s)]
*  The lawmakers on that trip included U.S. Senator Ed Markey, Congressman Benny Thompson, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=233.66s)]
*  Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, Congressman Jim McGovern. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=238.5s)]
*  They were all led by Louisiana Congressman Troy Carter. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=242.22s)]
*  From our communications with these individuals, they're frightened, they're concerned, they [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=245.94s)]
*  want to go home. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=253.06s)]
*  They're happy to see that members of Congress are here to listen, to take good notes, to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=254.66s)]
*  go back to Washington, to ensure that due process is granted, health care is provided, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=260.42s)]
*  and fairness is the rule of day. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=267.42s)]
*  Joining us now from Louisiana is Democratic Congressman Troy Carter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=271.42s)]
*  He's on the Homeland Security Committee. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  He led this delegation today to these immigration facilities. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  Congressman Carter, thank you very much for being here tonight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=280.21999999999997s)]
*  I really appreciate your time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=284.21999999999997s)]
*  Can you tell me more about this delegation that you led today? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  What you were able to see, who you were able to meet with, what you learned? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  We're very fortunate to have a bicameral delegation of members along with the ranking member of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  the Homeland Security Committee, Ben Thompson, United States Senator Edward Markey, Ayanna [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=302.86s)]
*  Pressley, and Jim McGovern, the three from Massachusetts. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=308.86s)]
*  Of course, the ranking member of Thompson is from Mississippi. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=312.86s)]
*  We had an opportunity to visit both the facility in Gina and in Basile. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=315.86s)]
*  We had an opportunity to meet with Mahmoud Khalil, to sit with him for just about an [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=320.86s)]
*  hour, and to talk about the concerns that he has, to talk about the atrocities that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=328.5s)]
*  he's dealing with. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=334.5s)]
*  He was very clear to share with us that his past, his present, and all of his work definitely [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=336.5s)]
*  is demonstrative of the fact that he is not anti-Semitic, that in fact, he was working [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=343.5s)]
*  for peace in advancing the causes of a two-state solution where Palestinians and those of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=349.5s)]
*  Israel could get along and live separately in peace. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=358.14s)]
*  He also was very clear that he is absolutely against Amass in any terrorist acts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=361.14s)]
*  So the fact that he is being charged with these trumped-up charges that our Secretary [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=368.14s)]
*  of State seems to have attempted to use him as a scapegoat, to use him as an example, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=375.14s)]
*  is ridiculous, unfair, and unconscionable. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=382.78s)]
*  Clearly, this individual's ability to exercise his First Amendment right, freedom of speech, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=387.78s)]
*  is being challenged. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=396.38s)]
*  Listen, in America, just because we disagree with you, you may not like what a person says. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=397.78s)]
*  You may find their comments to be opposite of your philosophies, but in America, we're [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=402.58s)]
*  protected by free speech. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=408.08s)]
*  And Mr. Kalil clearly is a victim of having his First Amendment denied and his Fifth Amendment [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=411.82s)]
*  of due process. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=419.82s)]
*  This has been a process where these individuals were not even told why they were arrested. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=421.62s)]
*  There was no warrant given for their arrest. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=427.90000000000003s)]
*  Same thing with Rumeissa and with Wendy Brito. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  Both of these, Wendy Brito from my home state of Louisiana, is a mother of three, married [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=436.86s)]
*  to an American citizen. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=442.22s)]
*  She's been here for 17 years. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=443.66s)]
*  Her children are all American citizens. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=445.62s)]
*  She serves as a volunteer in the public school system. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=448.22s)]
*  She went for her routine checkup with ISIS, and she never made it home. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=452.38s)]
*  Rumeissa wrote an op-ed. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  She did nothing else. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  She wrote an op-ed that someone didn't like and was snatched, literally snatched from [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=461.58s)]
*  the street and taken to multiple facilities before ultimately landing in Louisiana. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=468.3s)]
*  We had an opportunity to visit with her, to talk about her fears, to talk about her concerns, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=475.26s)]
*  to look at the facilities where they're clearly, while they appear to be healthy, there are [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=480.3s)]
*  a lot of challenges at these facilities that require immediate attention. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=486.46s)]
*  I'm proud that my members of Congress joined me today to not only shed light, but to also [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=490.42s)]
*  give hope that they are not forgotten and that we're going to continue to fight for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=497.86s)]
*  the rule of law and for the tenets of our Constitution that suggest that we're all free [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  and that our freedom of speech should not be taken lightly. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=508.58000000000004s)]
*  What can you tell us about the conditions of confinement, both at Basile and at Gina? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=512.74s)]
*  These facilities are really far from where some of these people were arrested and where [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=517.22s)]
*  they've lived. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=523.46s)]
*  I think part of the administration's thinking is that this is a far-flung area for most [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=524.46s)]
*  people, and so it's kind of out of sight, out of mind. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=528.7s)]
*  Were you and your colleagues today able to discern anything about the conditions in which [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=531.02s)]
*  people are being held? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=534.2s)]
*  Well, there are multiple reasons why I think they're at this particular facility. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=535.2s)]
*  One is in Louisiana, where they will have to be heard by the most conservative Fifth [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, Fifth Circuit Court, rather, which is one of the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=546.34s)]
*  most conservative benches in our country. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=552.02s)]
*  Number two is that this facility, unlike the other facilities across the country, have [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=555.62s)]
*  a 72 max day, hour stay rather, 72 hours. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=560.5s)]
*  In Louisiana, the stay can go up to a week, a month, multiple months. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  And so they are sent here in a facility that's very difficult to get to, very challenging [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=571.86s)]
*  for any lawyers or advocates to be able to access our family members. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=579.46s)]
*  The facility itself appeared to be clean, in fact, suspiciously clean, like perhaps [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=584.58s)]
*  there was some sprucing up before we got there. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=591.12s)]
*  The other thing that was noted is that all of the detainees we spoke to indicated that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=593.94s)]
*  it is very cold, that they aren't allowed to have blankets. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=600.0200000000001s)]
*  The temperature is very uncomfortable for them. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=606.7s)]
*  Many of the women in the facility indicated that they were not given proper feminine products [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=610.86s)]
*  as regularly as needed, in some cases not even given toilet paper. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=618.1400000000001s)]
*  That is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=623.82s)]
*  They shared with us that they are frightened, many of which have not been given dates of [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=626.34s)]
*  when their court hearing will be. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=631.86s)]
*  They're there. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=634.14s)]
*  Many said they don't know why they're there and were not able to share with us what the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=635.14s)]
*  next steps are. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=642.26s)]
*  Some now have lawyers, although many of them said that they asked for lawyers for days [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=644.46s)]
*  before finally being granted an opportunity to speak to counsel. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=650.22s)]
*  Louisiana Congressman Troy Carter, thank you for leading this delegation and for talking [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=657.34s)]
*  to us about it tonight. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=661.1s)]
*  This is a really, really, really important part of this system that has not had enough [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=662.3000000000001s)]
*  eyes on it, particularly people doing the kind of oversight and reporting back that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=666.5s)]
*  you are doing. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=669.74s)]
*  I expect that this will be the first of many such delegations, but thank you for helping [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=670.74s)]
*  us understand this first one today. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=674.26s)]
*  Really appreciate it, sir. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  We're committed to staying on top of this, keep the lights on to protect freedom of speech. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=679.0600000000001s)]
*  These four people who are well known, these names that you've heard, but there's so many [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=684.78s)]
*  others that we don't know their names, we don't know their faces, but they likewise [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=689.5s)]
*  deserve the kind of attention to protect their freedom of speech, protect their civil liberties. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=693.78s)]
*  Rather it's walking down the street on any college campus. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=699.3s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=703.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M9ZcKXe-OQ&t=704.9s)]
