*  If you record this show on your DVR, if you have your TV or your DVR to set up to record [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=0.0s)]
*  the Rachel Maddow show every night at 9 p.m. Eastern, first of all, thank you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=5.32s)]
*  You've kept me in blue all these years. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=10.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=12.22s)]
*  But also, I now need you to do another thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=13.22s)]
*  Keep the DVR setting that you've got now where you record the Rachel Maddow show. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=15.56s)]
*  That's still good. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=18.64s)]
*  But you also now need to add the show MSNBC Prime to your DVR recordings. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=19.64s)]
*  And the reason you need both of those is that I'm mostly going to be here on Mondays, even [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=24.44s)]
*  though our whole team is working to produce the show every night at 9 p.m. Eastern. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=28.76s)]
*  But in addition to every Monday that I'm here, I will also be here for big news events, including [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  some that might arise on short notice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=37.04s)]
*  So you need to set your DVR to record every night at 9 p.m. Eastern, which means setting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=39.08s)]
*  it to record the Rachel Maddow show and also MSNBC Prime. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=44.44s)]
*  Please. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=49.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Ii413eORk&t=50.36s)]
