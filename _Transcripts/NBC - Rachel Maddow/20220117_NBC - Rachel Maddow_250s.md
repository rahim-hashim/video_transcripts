# Republicans Enter 'Post-Election' Phase, Blindly Disputing Vote Outcomes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk)
*  Look at this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=0.0s)]
*  This was last week in Florida. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=1.54s)]
*  They finally held a special congressional election to fill the seat of the late Democratic [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=3.06s)]
*  Congressman Elsie Hastings, who died in April. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=7.76s)]
*  Congressman Hastings' district is really Democratic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=10.72s)]
*  It was therefore always really likely that they would—that the district would be electing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=13.24s)]
*  another Democrat to succeed him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=18.92s)]
*  I think that's probably why Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, just refused to hold [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=20.68s)]
*  the election to fill that seat for as long as he possibly could. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=25.28s)]
*  As long as no election was held to fill the Elsie Hastings seat, then Democrats would [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=28.26s)]
*  be down one of their numbers in the United States House of Representatives. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=32.260000000000005s)]
*  He held off and held off and held off. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=36.58s)]
*  That said, there are rules about these things. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=38.46s)]
*  He did get sued to finally hold the election, and finally we did get that election last [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=40.46s)]
*  week, more than nine months after Congressman Elsie Hastings died. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=45.1s)]
*  And like I said, this is a really Democratic district. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=48.7s)]
*  The Democratic primary for that seat was super hot and heavy, tons of candidates, a really [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=53.02s)]
*  close race. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=56.82000000000001s)]
*  And ultimately, I think the successful candidate in the Democratic primary won the primary [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=58.38s)]
*  by only five votes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=62.18s)]
*  Five votes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  But even by that exceedingly narrow margin, she did win the Democratic primary, which [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=66.06s)]
*  meant she was the Democrat on the ballot in the special election last week. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=70.14s)]
*  And she won the general election. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=75.66s)]
*  She won the special election last week in an absolute landslide. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=77.34s)]
*  Her name is Sheila Sherfulis McCormick, and she was the Democratic contender for that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=80.9s)]
*  seat. She's got a great story. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=86.98s)]
*  Actually, she's the child of Haitian immigrants. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=88.42s)]
*  Her parents were a taxi driver and a maid. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=91.78s)]
*  She is now a lawyer and the CEO of a health care company. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=94.7s)]
*  And thanks to her blowout victory in that congressional election last week, she's now [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  the first Haitian-American ever elected to Congress from Florida, only the second [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=101.86000000000001s)]
*  Haitian-American ever elected to Congress ever. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  Like I said, great story, all because she just cleaned up in that race. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=109.06s)]
*  She got 79 percent of the vote in that election last week. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=113.42s)]
*  The Republican who ran against her got less than 20 percent of the vote. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  Her margin of victory in that special election was almost 60 points, just a complete blowout. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  But because of where the Republican Party is right now and what they are now wired for, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=129.54s)]
*  that Republican who ran against Sheila Sherfulis McCormick, he's refusing to concede. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=135.74s)]
*  And is contesting the results. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=143.54s)]
*  He's brought a lawsuit to try to block the result. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  He said after the he said after election night, quote, I did not win. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=147.78s)]
*  So they say. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=151.9s)]
*  He recently told one CBS station in Florida, quote, We'll have some stuff coming out that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=154.78s)]
*  we've recently discovered. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=158.74s)]
*  Dude lost this race by by 60 points. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=161.62s)]
*  He did not break 20 percent of the vote in a two way race. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=166.42s)]
*  I didn't win. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=173.94s)]
*  So they say. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  Republicans now any race anywhere in the country, any margin of loss. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=178.26s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=187.38s)]
*  Why would they accept an election result unless they won? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=188.22s)]
*  Why would any Republican losing any election anywhere in the country from this point [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=191.7s)]
*  forward admit that they had lost, concede and congratulate their opponent? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  Think that's the way to get ahead in the Republican Party right now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=201.22s)]
*  Sheila Sherfulis McCormick will be sworn in tomorrow on Capitol Hill, her Republican [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=206.82s)]
*  opponent, who she beat by more than by nearly 60 points. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=211.94s)]
*  He is not conceding that she won that race, even as she is slated to be sworn in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=216.1s)]
*  Because Republicans, because that's the way the Republican Party works now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=221.38s)]
*  They are a post-election party. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRD788p3xk&t=225.7s)]
