# American Women Face New Era Of Very Big, Invasive Government
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw)
*  Not just for pregnant women, but for all Americans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=0.0s)]
*  Today starts a new era of very, very, very, very, very big government. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=3.5s)]
*  Very intrusive government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=9.0s)]
*  Do you want to start a family or have your first child? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=12.0s)]
*  Or maybe you have a child or children already you'd like to have one more? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=15.0s)]
*  Mazel Tov, congratulations, it is a beautiful thing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=19.0s)]
*  Everybody with a heart wishes you all the best. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=22.5s)]
*  In this country though, now, the decision tree for you is much more complex than it was before. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=26.0s)]
*  Now obviously most wanted pregnancies are safe and straightforward and they end with the happiest possible news. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=32.0s)]
*  But sadly, many don't. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=39.0s)]
*  Because of what the court did today, if, God forbid, you have a miscarriage in your pregnancy, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=43.0s)]
*  now in some states that will be more than a personal tragedy. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=49.0s)]
*  That will be a matter of public record and potentially public investigation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=52.0s)]
*  Your miscarriage will be viewed as a potential crime. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=57.0s)]
*  Are you suspected of having induced that miscarriage? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=61.0s)]
*  Did the police want to talk to you about some questions they have about whether somebody else might have induced it for you? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=65.0s)]
*  And how do you plan to prove that it happened on its own in the natural course? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=70.0s)]
*  How can you prove it? These officers are going to need to speak with you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=75.0s)]
*  Think about how that gets enforced. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=79.0s)]
*  Think about the relationship between American women and the government in this environment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=81.0s)]
*  How do authorities know if you've miscarried in the first place? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=86.0s)]
*  What if somebody heard you were pregnant? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=90.0s)]
*  They thought you might be pregnant and now it seems like you're not. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=92.0s)]
*  How is that investigation conducted? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=96.0s)]
*  How is the state government in your state, how are your police locally going to check [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=98.0s)]
*  to see if maybe you had been pregnant and now you're not? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=103.0s)]
*  And did you just commit a felony? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=106.0s)]
*  If you seek care at a hospital in the event of a miscarriage, the drug you're most often given as treatment for a miscarriage [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=109.0s)]
*  is the same drug that Republican lawmakers are now trying to treat as an illegal instrument of abortion in their states. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=115.0s)]
*  I mean, even if you have just had a miscarriage naturally in the natural course of events, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=123.0s)]
*  you will likely be treated for that miscarriage with medication they are targeting with their abortion bans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=129.0s)]
*  Your use of that drug may make you a criminal suspect [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=135.0s)]
*  and make the exact scene and circumstance of your miscarriage a crime scene, even if it was in the hospital. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=139.0s)]
*  In some states, even if the complication in your pregnancy is a risk to your health, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=148.0s)]
*  if continuing to carry the pregnancy could injure you, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=152.0s)]
*  doctors in some states will be forced to stand by and deliberately inflict that risk on you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=155.0s)]
*  by forcing you to keep the pregnancy going against your will because otherwise they will face jail. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=161.0s)]
*  What does that do to the relationship between you and your doctor? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=166.0s)]
*  What does that do again to the relationship between you as an American woman and your government? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=169.0s)]
*  If you have the kind of complication in your pregnancy where the pregnancy is not viable, where the baby cannot live, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=176.0s)]
*  in some states you may now be forced by the state government under threat of criminal prosecution [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=182.0s)]
*  to nevertheless carry the non-viable pregnancy to term. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=187.0s)]
*  Think about how that gets enforced. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=191.0s)]
*  Think about what that means about the relationship between you as an American citizen and your government that is forcing that out of you. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=195.0s)]
*  Today starts an era of very, very, very big government, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=205.0s)]
*  where it's the government that decides if you're going to have a baby or not, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=209.0s)]
*  where it's the government that is in charge of your pregnancy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=213.0s)]
*  For women who have an unwanted, unplanned pregnancy, the nightmare is here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=218.0s)]
*  In many ways, though, it is also here now for any woman who wants a child, who wants to have a baby, and now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=224.0s)]
*  I mean, until today, this was an area of life in which we had some privacy to make our own decisions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=230.0s)]
*  Now, at least for now, in Republican-controlled states, it's the police. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=235.0s)]
*  It's the state. Knock, knock. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=240.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4EMqMX8Jhw&t=243.0s)]
