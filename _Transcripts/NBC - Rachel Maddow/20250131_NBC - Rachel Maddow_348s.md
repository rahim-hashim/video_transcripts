# Top Treasury official exits as Musk makes grab for federal payment system
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI)
*  We're still in the early hours of understanding what this means, but I think this may end [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=0.0s)]
*  up being a very big deal. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Today the Post broke news that the highest ranking career official at Treasury, a man [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=5.16s)]
*  named David Liebrich, is leaving the U.S. government, quote, after a clash with allies [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  of billionaire Elon Musk over access to sensitive payment systems. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=14.56s)]
*  So Elon Musk and his team of people have reportedly been asking Treasury for access to the payment [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=19.84s)]
*  systems that the government uses to pay its bills, to pay out trillions of dollars a year [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=25.88s)]
*  across the federal government. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Also payments to businesses and individual households. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=33.88s)]
*  So if you're a federal worker, before your paycheck hits your bank account, it goes through [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=36.44s)]
*  this system. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=40.04s)]
*  Same thing if you get a Social Security check or a Medicare benefit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=41.04s)]
*  Payments to government contractors, tax refunds, grant recipients. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  You get the idea. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=48.24s)]
*  This is basically the government's checkbook at the Treasury Department, how they pay for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=49.24s)]
*  everything. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=52.88s)]
*  That only a few career officials actually have access to use this system. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=54.84s)]
*  But according to the Post today, Elon Musk and his team have demanded access to it as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=59.24s)]
*  well, which led to a dispute with a very high ranking career official at Treasury who's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=62.84s)]
*  now quit over this dispute. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=68.76s)]
*  Who's now resigned. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  The Post says it is unclear what exactly Elon Musk's team wanted to do, why they wanted [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=71.64s)]
*  access to this incredibly sensitive system. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=77.36s)]
*  One former Treasury Department official tells the Post, quote, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=80.56s)]
*  This payment system has never been used in a way to execute a partisan agenda. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=84.72s)]
*  You have to really put bad intentions in place for that to be the case. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=89.28s)]
*  I do not know enough about what this payment system does or how it works to understand [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=96.2s)]
*  the implication of it potentially being misused. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=99.56s)]
*  But I will tell you, I have been watching enough of these red flags in the last 11 days [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=102.72s)]
*  to recognize that this is a very big one. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=106.0s)]
*  And if the people in control of this very sensitive, very highly restricted system now [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=109.12s)]
*  do have bad intentions for what they're going to do with it, what does that mean? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=115.76s)]
*  What is the scope of what they could do? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=120.56s)]
*  Joining us now is Washington Post Senior White House reporter Isaac Arnstorf, who's one of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=123.04s)]
*  the reporters who broke this story. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  He's also the author of Finish What We Started, the MAGA movement's ground war to end democracy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=128.16s)]
*  Mr. Arnstorf, thanks very much for being here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=133.56s)]
*  I know it's a really, really busy night. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=135.72s)]
*  Let me start by asking you what kind of information, what kind of system this is, this payment [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=138.48s)]
*  system. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=142.84s)]
*  Well, what you said is exactly right, Rachel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=143.84s)]
*  This is the checkbook. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=146.04s)]
*  This is how the government's bills get paid. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=147.18s)]
*  And David Liebrich, as the most senior official in the Treasury Department, who was the acting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=150.64s)]
*  Treasury secretary until Trump's nominee was confirmed, is the expert at managing it, including [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=156.84s)]
*  the debt ceiling, which, as we know, is coming up really, really soon with the spending limit [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  in danger of being breached. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  That is all—you know, he's the expert on that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  That's his expertise. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=176.44s)]
*  All the payments to every—this is how the government pays its bills. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=178.6s)]
*  And it's never been anything that has any political role. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=183.0s)]
*  And Liebrich is a professional. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  He's worked there for many decades and through both administrations. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=189.28s)]
*  And this isn't something that has—they're just spending the—making the payments that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=194.28s)]
*  Congress authorized and that the government obligated. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=201.56s)]
*  And Isaac, I'll tell you, the reason I wanted to talk to you tonight, even though this is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=206.0s)]
*  a very busy night and a lot's going on, is because I'm really spooked by the quote from [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=209.24s)]
*  the former Treasury official who says—like, seems to be really raising the alarms that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=213.08s)]
*  somebody with bad intentions who wanted to use this payment system for partisan reasons [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=218.04s)]
*  could do something very alarming, could do—that that's something that we should really [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=224.28s)]
*  worry about. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  And it would seem Mr. Liebrich resigning, given all the different presidents he served, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=229.64s)]
*  would also seem to be raising that red flag even higher, that this is something dangerous. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  What do you think the stakes are in terms of the misuse of this system that you're describing? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=238.44s)]
*  Well, my understanding is that this dispute between him and the Doe's representative [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=242.44s)]
*  was that he wanted to know what they wanted to do with the system and not trying to be [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=249.24s)]
*  uncooperative, but how could he be helpful? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=256.2s)]
*  And that led to them putting him on administrative leave, and rather than that, he decided to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=260.04s)]
*  retire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=268.2s)]
*  But we are still working to figure out what exactly they have in mind with trying to get [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=269.4s)]
*  access to the payment system and if they're going to succeed in doing so. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=274.2s)]
*  But obviously, this comes in the backdrop of what Trump appointed Elon Musk and the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=278.84s)]
*  Doge to do, which is root around in the federal government to look for spending cuts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=284.84s)]
*  And obviously also the OMB memo from earlier this week, where the administration was [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=292.12s)]
*  temporarily or to some extent still just flat out refusing to spend money that Congress [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=298.2s)]
*  appropriated and authorized to be spent because they don't want to. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=304.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's one thing to fight over whether or not spending is allowed to go out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  It's another thing to seize the checkbook by which payments are effectively made. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=312.44s)]
*  Isaac Arnstorf, senior White House reporter for The Washington Post, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=319.08s)]
*  I can tell this is a story that we have not heard the end of. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=321.64s)]
*  Thank you for helping us understand it tonight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=324.2s)]
*  We look forward to talking to you about it again. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OujB43E-JeI&t=325.8s)]
