# U.S. Sees Shift In Russian Strategy In Ukraine; Reaffirms Support For Ukrainian Defense
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0)
*  Joining us now is Pentagon press secretary and retired Rear Admiral John Kirby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=0.0s)]
*  Admiral Kirby, we appreciate you making time to be with us this evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=5.2s)]
*  The Kremlin today is pushing back on a claim from U.S. intelligence that President Putin's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=9.8s)]
*  aides aren't being honest with him about what's happening on the ground in Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=14.84s)]
*  Tell me about the concern you've got, if that's true. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=20.16s)]
*  If Vladimir Putin is not receiving honest battlefield intelligence from his advisors, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=22.44s)]
*  what does that mean? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=26.96s)]
*  Well, one thing it could mean is that once he does become fully informed, he might overreact. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=28.56s)]
*  I mean, he's already escalated this conflict. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=33.64s)]
*  You don't have to look any further than the dreadful images that are coming out of places [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=36.64s)]
*  like Mariupol and Kyiv to see how hard he continues to strike Ukrainian citizens and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=40.44s)]
*  the Ukrainian cities. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  So he could maybe overreact if he's not being fully informed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=48.68s)]
*  We don't know what he's going to do when he finds out the full scope of his military's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=52.32s)]
*  failures inside Ukraine. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=57.16s)]
*  The second thing that's disconcerting for us is what does this mean for the negotiating [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=59.08s)]
*  table? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=64.6s)]
*  If he's not fully informed about how poorly they are doing on the ground, then it could [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=65.6s)]
*  definitely affect the negotiating tactics at the table and the degree to which he's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=70.84s)]
*  able, even if he's willing, the degree to which he's able to negotiate in good faith [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  with the Zelensky government. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=79.84s)]
*  Okay, so that's one valid concern. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=81.44s)]
*  Is he going to a negotiating table or are his people going there with correct information? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=83.44s)]
*  But you've also been particular in describing Russia's movements in and around Kyiv as repositioning [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=87.6s)]
*  as opposed to a de-escalation, which is what the Russian negotiators suggested the other [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=93.28s)]
*  day in Istanbul. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=98.4s)]
*  What's the latest intelligence that you can tell us about troops and what they're doing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=99.4s)]
*  around Kyiv? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  Are they, is there any indication that they're repositioning versus pulling back and refocusing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  on eastern Ukraine? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=110.16s)]
*  What we have seen is a small number, less than about 20% of what we assess is their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=112.2s)]
*  assembled force around Kyiv moving away from the city, more towards the north. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=118.72s)]
*  It's not exactly clear where they're going to go, how long they're going to be there, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=124.04s)]
*  or what the ultimate purpose is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=128.32s)]
*  But what we don't believe is that he's planning to send them home because the majority of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=130.24s)]
*  the troops that he still has around Kyiv are still there in Kyiv. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=134.52s)]
*  Now they're in defensive positions. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=138.16s)]
*  They're not moving on the city, but the city still is coming under airstrikes and missile [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=139.6s)]
*  strikes every single day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=143.96s)]
*  So what we think he's going to do is refit these troops, resupply them and put them back [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=145.96s)]
*  into Ukraine for offensive operations somewhere else. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=151.48s)]
*  Now again, we don't know exactly where, we don't know exactly when. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=154.92s)]
*  All we can do is go by our other assessment that the Russians are trying to prioritize [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=158.12s)]
*  that Donbass region, the eastern part of the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=163.12s)]
*  So it's possible that some of these troops will just simply be moved from Kyiv over to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=165.9s)]
*  the Donbass to try to reinforce their offensive operations there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=170.86s)]
*  There's also new reporting. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=175.16s)]
*  You know, a month ago we had a word about a fire at a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=176.16s)]
*  Now this is a massive concern all around Europe, not the least Ukraine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=182.94s)]
*  There's reporting today Russia's pulling back from Chernobyl because of radiation exposure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  You seem to suggest that today's briefing that it's not necessarily radiation exposure [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=192.18s)]
*  that might be causing them to pull back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=198.86s)]
*  Well, what we think is that we do sense assess that some of their troops are leaving Chernobyl. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=200.46s)]
*  The general assessment is that this is all part of again, this repositioning effort. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  We have no indication that it's a, that there's a radiation problem or a health hazard at [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=211.16s)]
*  this time. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=215.38s)]
*  Look, we're going to continue to watch this and monitor it as best we can, but our best [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=216.38s)]
*  Our best assessment at this point is that this is part of his repositioning effort, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=220.46s)]
*  the ability to take troops out of some area and then move them into another area. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  Today the head of Britain's GCHQ, which is the British equivalent of America's NSA, said [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  that some Russian troops are refusing orders. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  Some might be sabotaging their own equipment. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=238.9s)]
*  And there was one report of shooting down their own aircraft. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=241.74s)]
*  I guess my question to you is, do you understand whether that dynamic is going on amongst Russian [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=244.78s)]
*  forces and does the Pentagon believe this is happening wide scale or is this something [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  that is largely very specific and isolated? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=257.22s)]
*  Yeah, I can't confirm every item in that British reporting there about shooting down aircraft [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=259.82s)]
*  and everything that they put in there. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=268.02s)]
*  That said, Ali, what we have seen is poor unit cohesion, poor morale, poor leadership. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=270.02s)]
*  We've got plenty of anecdotal evidence that at times and at places Russian soldiers have [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=276.34s)]
*  simply given up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=281.7s)]
*  They've simply walked away from the fight that they have in some cases actually sabotage [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=282.7s)]
*  their own vehicles so that they would run out of fuel and not be able to replace that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=289.9s)]
*  fuel. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=293.34s)]
*  We know that they have had morale and unit cohesion problems born, we think, largely [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=294.74s)]
*  out of the fact that it's a conscript force. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  They're draftees. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=302.82s)]
*  These are young men who in many cases had no idea that they were going to be invading [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=303.82s)]
*  another country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=308.18s)]
*  They thought they were going on a training exercise and they clearly weren't fully prepared [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=309.18s)]
*  and ready for actual combat. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=312.94s)]
*  So we know they're having problems like that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  They're also having leadership issues, command and control, not only the ability of their [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=317.14s)]
*  generals to talk to one another, but the willingness to talk to one another and to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=321.74s)]
*  coordinate their operations between say air and ground. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=325.48s)]
*  There's very little bit of that joint effectiveness that you would expect from a modern military [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=329.0s)]
*  these days. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=333.02s)]
*  Admiral, I just want to explore this a little more with you because of your long military [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=334.02s)]
*  expertise. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=338.3s)]
*  Tell me about that distinction in morale where we're seeing these Ukrainian troops who going [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=339.54s)]
*  into this thing did not look like they were well equipped to take on one of the largest [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=345.66s)]
*  armies in the world. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=349.70000000000005s)]
*  But the morale of those troops seems to be very different from the morale of the Russian [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=350.82000000000005s)]
*  troops. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=355.26000000000005s)]
*  Tell me how that actually plays out when you're commanding troops. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  Morale is not to be underestimated in a military unit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  It can be a terrific force multiplier. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  By that, I mean it can actually add exponentially to a unit's effectiveness on the field of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=368.14000000000004s)]
*  battle or at sea on warships. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=374.06s)]
*  The way a unit feels about itself, about its effectiveness, its competency, about the teammates, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=377.38s)]
*  about themselves, all of that can have a huge impact on effectiveness and efficiency in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=384.54s)]
*  battle and in combat. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=391.54s)]
*  We're not seeing that on the Russian side. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=393.26s)]
*  We have plenty of anecdotal evidence, as I said, that they're not fighting well, that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=395.06s)]
*  they're not fully informed. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=398.94s)]
*  They're even having trouble still feeding their troops and fueling their vehicles. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=400.38s)]
*  There's a lot of problems that the Russians have caused on themselves. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=404.94s)]
*  On the Ukrainian side, however, morale is very high. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  They are too. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=410.9s)]
*  They're taking losses. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=411.9s)]
*  They're suffering. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=412.9s)]
*  They're watching their friends and their families have to leave. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=413.9s)]
*  They're seeing their cities destroyed, and yet this has really fired them up. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=416.3s)]
*  They've got an esprit de corps. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  They're getting the weapons and the systems that they need to fight back effectively, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=422.28s)]
*  and they're using those weapons. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  They've been very agile, very nimble on the battlefield, choosing when and where and how [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=427.26s)]
*  they're going to defend and how they're going to strike in very, very devastating ways for [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=432.38s)]
*  the Russian military. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=436.58s)]
*  Let's talk about those weapons that they're getting. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=437.94s)]
*  The U.S. has already supplied Ukraine with a lot of lethal weaponry, more arriving every [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=439.46s)]
*  day. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=443.5s)]
*  But if this war grinds on for months, is the Pentagon willing to and in a position to continue [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=444.5s)]
*  supplying Ukraine with weapons to fight Russia at the current pace that we are doing? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=450.5s)]
*  President Biden has been very clear that we're going to continue to support Ukraine's ability [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=457.62s)]
*  to defend itself as long as we can and as fast as we can. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=461.42s)]
*  And you're right, there is material arriving even as you and I are speaking. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=464.82s)]
*  And that's coming on the last package that the president approved, the $800 million security [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=468.46s)]
*  package that he approved just a little bit more than a week ago. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=473.9s)]
*  There's already been a half a dozen or so shipments of that material getting into the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=477.58s)]
*  region. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=481.06s)]
*  We're going to work to get it into the hands of the Ukrainians as fast as we can. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=482.06s)]
*  And I would add that while we're focused rightly on the security assistance, the material, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=484.98s)]
*  we also need to remember the training for the last eight years. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=489.38s)]
*  The United States, Great Britain, Canada, other allies have been devoting a lot of training [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=492.38s)]
*  into Ukrainian armed forces to help them use this material. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=497.94s)]
*  So it's not just about the stuff. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=501.74s)]
*  It's about the way they use the stuff and how they know how to use these weapons systems. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=503.7s)]
*  And that came that came at a great effort by by so many allies to help train them over [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=507.78s)]
*  the last eight years. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=513.06s)]
*  The U.S. intelligence on this has been fairly accurate since even before this invasion. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=514.06s)]
*  And started there was one thing, though, that that that was an estimate that it would [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=519.22s)]
*  it would not be long if Russia threw everything it had and all of those troops that it had [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=524.02s)]
*  lined up. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=527.94s)]
*  This would end sooner than than it has. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=528.94s)]
*  We're now in the sixth week of this war. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=531.7s)]
*  And one of the enduring mysteries is the airspace above Ukraine. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=534.22s)]
*  For outside observers, they've been curious as to why the Russian Air Force has not been [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=538.58s)]
*  able to achieve air superiority. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=542.58s)]
*  What's your what's your take on this? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=544.82s)]
*  One of the reasons is because of how nimble the Ukrainians have been with their air defense [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=547.02s)]
*  systems. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=551.1800000000001s)]
*  They have both short and long range air defense systems. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=552.1800000000001s)]
*  They're using them very effectively and quite efficiently. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=554.94s)]
*  They're being very careful about how they're defending their skies. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=559.38s)]
*  And they have been able to make it very difficult for Russian pilots to fly inside Ukrainian [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=563.22s)]
*  airspace. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=568.02s)]
*  In fact, most airstrikes that you're seeing, the damage that you're seeing, most of those [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=569.02s)]
*  airstrikes are actually emanating and never coming and the aircraft are never leaving [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=572.7199999999999s)]
*  Russian airspace or Belarusian airspace. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  They're not venturing into Ukrainian airspace. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=580.9799999999999s)]
*  And if they do, they're not staying very, very long. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=582.64s)]
*  And, of course, a lot of the airstrikes are missile strikes that are being launched from [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=585.16s)]
*  airfields and from sites inside Russia or Belarus. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians have been very, very effective in how they're trying to defend their skies. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=593.66s)]
*  We assess that the skies are contested. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=597.7199999999999s)]
*  Here's the other thing, though. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=600.24s)]
*  We're also working with other allies and partners who have long range air defense systems that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=601.24s)]
*  we know the Ukrainians know how to use, like the S-300. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=606.12s)]
*  And we're trying to work with them to see if they can provide some of those systems [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=609.4s)]
*  to help replenish the stocks of the Ukrainians. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=612.84s)]
*  Admiral, to the extent that Russia has said and might be refocusing some of its efforts [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=616.04s)]
*  on eastern Ukraine, which is where this all started, what are your concerns about that? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, this is an area that's been it's been a hot war for eight years, Ali. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=630.4s)]
*  I mean, this is this is a piece of ground that that Russia has long coveted and long [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=633.68s)]
*  wanted. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=639.4s)]
*  We think they certainly overextended themselves in the early weeks of this conflict, attacking [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=640.4s)]
*  on multiple lines of axes north, south, east, trying to take the capital city. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=645.48s)]
*  And they've realized that they're not going to do that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=650.68s)]
*  So now it looks like they're going to redouble their efforts in the Donbas region, which [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  they've been fighting over now for eight years. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=656.0s)]
*  It's unclear whether this is a negotiating tactic. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=658.48s)]
*  Mr. Putin just wants to get some more leverage at the table because he's got more ground [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=661.56s)]
*  in the eastern part of the country or whether that is, in fact, now a more limited goal [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=665.16s)]
*  he's trying to achieve. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=669.16s)]
*  Just get the Donbas region, get that land bridge to Crimea and call it a day. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=670.48s)]
*  We just not sure where where they intend to go on this. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=675.0s)]
*  But one thing we know for sure, there are lots of Ukrainian forces in that part of the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=677.76s)]
*  country and they are still there and they're still fighting very, very hard. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  The Russians have not been able to take that Donbas region. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=686.24s)]
*  Now, we'll see if they're going to redouble their efforts, if they're going to add reinforcements. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=689.36s)]
*  We think that that's what's in their minds. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=692.96s)]
*  But believe me, the Ukrainians are going to they've made it very clear, not just in word, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=694.88s)]
*  but indeed that they're going to continue to fight for that part of their country. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=698.48s)]
*  Retired Rear Admiral John Kirby from the Pentagon, we appreciate your time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=704.24s)]
*  Thank you for joining us, sir. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=707.8s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=708.8s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJKWeAJRD0&t=709.8s)]
