# Republican Hails Infrastructure Investment She Bashed As 'Socialism'; Voted Against It
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A)
*  We talk a lot about how we are in unprecedented political times on this show, but some aspects [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=0.0s)]
*  of our current politics are as reliable and as shameless as ever. Here, for example, is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=5.64s)]
*  a statement from Republican Iowa Congresswoman Ashley Hinson. Quote, this landmark investment [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=10.76s)]
*  will be game changing for Iowans and communities along the Mississippi River. She's talking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  about an $829 million federal investment from President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=20.72s)]
*  package that passed late last year, an investment that benefits her district. She goes on, that's [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=27.32s)]
*  why I helped lead a bipartisan group of my colleagues in urging the administration to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=31.92s)]
*  prioritize funding for these essential upgrades. There is just one problem with this statement. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=35.5s)]
*  Republican Congresswoman Ashley Hinson, you will be shocked to hear, voted against the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=41.2s)]
*  bipartisan infrastructure package. In fact, she was loudly, proudly against it. This is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=45.8s)]
*  another one of her press releases a few days after that bill passed in November. It calls [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=51.04s)]
*  the bill the biggest leap towards socialism this nation has ever seen. Quote, it takes [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=55.12s)]
*  the Marxist ideology that once only existed in textbooks and makes it law in the United [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=59.76s)]
*  States. So which one is it, Congresswoman? Is this bill Marxism come to life or a game [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=64.16s)]
*  changing investment for Iowans? This week, Republican Congresswoman Kay Granger of Texas [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=69.56s)]
*  put out a statement praising a $403 million federal investment in her district made possible [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=74.6s)]
*  because of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. She called it a great day for Fort Worth and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=79.88s)]
*  says the investment will make Fort Worth safer and stronger. And she also voted against [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=84.84s)]
*  the bill. In fact, on the day it passed, Granger put out a press release calling it a so-called [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=90.08s)]
*  infrastructure bill that was radical spending on a liberal wish list. Now, these members [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=94.64s)]
*  of Congress aren't the first or only examples of Republicans taking credit for stuff from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=99.56s)]
*  the bipartisan infrastructure package they voted against. Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=103.92s)]
*  was in fact first. He took credit for the chunk of the bill that would benefit his home [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=108.72s)]
*  the day Biden signed it, literally 10 days after he had just voted against it. And now [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  as we start to see the projects in the bill go from lines of text to actual broken ground [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  and construction, get ready to see a lot more of this hypocrisy. And so the next time you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=124.84s)]
*  see a congressperson taking credit for a big piece of infrastructure near you, especially [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=130.72s)]
*  if they're a Republican, it might be wise to just double check how they voted. I'm just [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=135.6s)]
*  saying. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_t_K3jzQ1A&t=141.16s)]
