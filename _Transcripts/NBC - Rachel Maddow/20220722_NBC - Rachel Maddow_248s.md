# Why The Jan. 6 Josh Hawley Video Is About More Than A Senator Running Away
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU)
*  Pop quiz, it's an easy one though. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=0.0s)]
*  Which elected official had the worst time watching tonight's hearing? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=2.5s)]
*  A currently serving elected official, so we're not talking about former President Donald [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  Trump, who had the worst night watching tonight's proceedings? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  It is an easy one to answer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=17.46s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Senator Josh Hawley also had to flee. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Earlier that afternoon, before the joint session started, he walked across the east front of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=25.62s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=29.92s)]
*  As you can see in this photo, he raised his fist in solidarity with the protesters already [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=34.84s)]
*  amassing at the security gates. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=40.36s)]
*  We spoke with a Capitol police officer who was out there at the time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=43.28s)]
*  She told us that Senator Hawley's gesture riled up the crowd, and it bothered her greatly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  because he was doing it in a safe space, protected by the officers and the barriers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=55.16s)]
*  Later that day, Senator Hawley fled after those protesters he helped to rile up stormed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=62.12s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=68.08s)]
*  See for yourself. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=69.88s)]
*  That spot shadow, it burns. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=85.08s)]
*  It burns. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=89.24s)]
*  Joining us now is our colleague Stephanie Ruhl from the 11th Hour. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=90.24s)]
*  Great to have you here, Steph. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  Also our friend Claire McCaskill, former United States Senator from the great state, the great [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  aforementioned state of Missouri. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Claire, will you forgive me if I ask for your response to that moment with Senator Hawley [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=102.32s)]
*  this evening? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=107.68s)]
*  Well, I thought you were going to follow up who had the worst night watching it tonight [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=108.68s)]
*  to which former senator had the best night watching it tonight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=114.38s)]
*  Which former senator whose name rhymes with Schmiermischmashkala? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=118.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=123.46s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=124.46s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=125.46s)]
*  You know, I think one important thing to remember here, all kidding aside, is Josh Hawley was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=126.46s)]
*  largely responsible for that day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=132.82s)]
*  We have to remember how this came down. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=136.74s)]
*  Mitch McConnell got everyone together and said there has to be a senator that objects [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=138.9s)]
*  We're not going to object. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=144.06s)]
*  It would absolutely be a mistake for us to object. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=145.9s)]
*  And one senator defied him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=149.54s)]
*  One senator decided politically it would be in his best interest to take up the mantle [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=152.3s)]
*  of refusing to allow the will of the American people to pass peacefully to the next president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=158.06s)]
*  That was Josh Hawley. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  And Josh Hawley, once Josh Hawley did that, then he had a lot of other rats that joined [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=166.82s)]
*  him on that particular boat, including Ted Cruz and others. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=172.14s)]
*  But he, if you remember on the floor after this all happened, Mitt Romney was as mad [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=176.1s)]
*  as I have ever seen Mitt Romney as he confronted Josh Hawley in a speech saying, you did this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=181.22s)]
*  with your lies. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=187.14s)]
*  You did this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=188.5s)]
*  So this is really quite a bookend. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=189.94s)]
*  That picture of the fist. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  And can I just tell you? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=196.26s)]
*  No senators run in the Capitol ever. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  It is not what you do in the Capitol if you're a senator. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=202.02s)]
*  You walk slowly. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=205.62s)]
*  You do not run for your life. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=208.1s)]
*  And that's what he was doing there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=210.22s)]
*  He is afraid and he is showing that he's afraid. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=211.78s)]
*  And I hope that sears into people's memories that he is the one who began this whole mess. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=216.18s)]
*  And the contrast between riling them in that moment when he in that moment is protected [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=221.58s)]
*  from them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=226.02s)]
*  And then once they close in on him, he takes off. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njsuqcpgcTU&t=227.02s)]
