# Why Alabama Republicans may be plotting something bigger with defiance of Supreme Court
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ)
*  This map captures just, it's like a checklist of noncompliance. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  There was never any intent in this building to comply with that court order. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=6.96s)]
*  Never. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Also, there was never any intent in this building to comply with the Voting Rights Act. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  That was Alabama state lawmaker Chris England speaking on Friday, a Democrat lodging one [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=16.72s)]
*  final objection as Alabama Republicans defied an order from the United States Supreme Court [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=24.84s)]
*  to fix a very problematic congressional map. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=32.84s)]
*  Last month, the Supreme Court found Alabama in violation of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=37.04s)]
*  In Alabama, one in four voters is black, but Republicans in the legislature cleverly constructed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=41.64s)]
*  the state's congressional districts, so only one of seven congressional districts in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=47.28s)]
*  state is majority black. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=53.6s)]
*  That was too racially discriminatory even for this hard right conservative United States [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=61.64s)]
*  And so the court ordered Alabama to redraw the lines so black voters would make up the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=62.64s)]
*  majority of the majority or something quite close to it in two congressional districts, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=66.9s)]
*  not just one. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=72.72s)]
*  To that, Alabama Republicans just basically said, no, we won't do it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=74.86s)]
*  They did draw new lines for new districts, but the new lines don't include anything [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=79.2s)]
*  like a new majority black district. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=83.68s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the sort of best case terrible scenario here is that Alabama Republicans are trying [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  to stretch this out as long as possible to try and give themselves another shot at holding [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=94.66s)]
*  another election with illegal racially discriminatory maps that favor Republicans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=99.64s)]
*  That's the best case terrible scenario. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=105.04s)]
*  The worst case terrible scenario is that Alabama Republicans are just deciding that they don't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=109.18s)]
*  recognize the authority of the federal government and federal courts. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=113.9s)]
*  And that, of course, brings back all sorts of bad memories about what Alabama is capable [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=118.42s)]
*  of. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=122.06s)]
*  But when we're about to have a presidential election in which the central question is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=123.06s)]
*  likely to be whether or not we as a country follow the law, whether the law applies to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=127.54s)]
*  everyone, this is a particularly incendiary move by Alabama Republicans, one that Alabama [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=132.10000000000002s)]
*  Democrats like state rep Chris England have been raising the alarm about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=138.62s)]
*  One thing that I always say about Alabama, it continues to be the place where the dead [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=145.22000000000003s)]
*  bury the living. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=150.5s)]
*  We're haunted by a ghost of the past. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  And every time we get to a critical juncture where a better or better angels could lead [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=156.5s)]
*  us in a proper direction, we refuse and we say we dare defend our rights. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=161.42s)]
*  Joining us now is Chris England. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=169.94s)]
*  He is a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=171.66s)]
*  Representative England, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=177.38s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about those two scenarios that I just mentioned there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=181.22s)]
*  Do you think that Alabama Republicans are just sort of playing for time and knowing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=186.54s)]
*  they're going to lose this, but they're dragging it out as long as possible? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  Or do you think they really are making an attempt to resist or nullify this federal [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=195.06s)]
*  court order? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=200.94s)]
*  I think it's a host of different things. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=203.82s)]
*  I think at the bare minimum, it's an attempt to protect status quo. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  But at the worst of it all, I think it's an attempt to also buy time to use this legal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  map for two more years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  But the other part of it is I think it's an extension of the work that was done to eliminate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=216.66s)]
*  Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County case to now maybe using this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=222.46s)]
*  noncompliant, defiant map to go back to the Supreme Court and hopefully convince the justices [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=227.94s)]
*  that we're all conservatives here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=238.1s)]
*  So throw us a bone and maybe finish off Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=239.9s)]
*  So if the Supreme Court was already willing in the Shelby County case to gut the Voting [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=246.14000000000001s)]
*  Rights Act by getting rid of Section 5, but Section 2 still exists, you think they may [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=251.1s)]
*  be doing this basically to tee up a case that would throw out the rest of the Voting Rights [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=256.5s)]
*  Act, that would throw out Section 2 as well? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=261.3s)]
*  No, I don't doubt it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  I think it's a long legal strategy that ultimately buys in either time or makes another argument [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  to go after Section 2. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=273.62s)]
*  But on the other hand, it also throws the entire map to one or two people, a special [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=275.54s)]
*  master will draw it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=282.14s)]
*  And we basically shirked our constitutional responsibilities to represent our constituents [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=283.86s)]
*  and use them essentially as collateral damage for a political cause. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  It was actually driven by people who don't even live here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=293.42s)]
*  I don't know if you've heard this or not, but the speaker of the House, McCarthy, called [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  the Senate sponsor of the map and told him he's interested in keeping his majority. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=302.42s)]
*  But I think Alabama citizens were probably more interested in the state keeping up to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  its obligations and following the law. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=311.66s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy encouraging this, encouraging defiance of the federal courts in order to [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  eke out more illegally defined Republican leaning districts obviously has disturbing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=320.22s)]
*  national implications. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=326.38000000000005s)]
*  But so does just saying that court orders don't matter, that if the federal courts [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=328.18s)]
*  are going to stand up and tell states what to do, states have an option to disobey those [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=332.18s)]
*  orders. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=337.86s)]
*  I wonder, Representative England, what's been the reaction among Alabama voters, among [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=338.86s)]
*  your constituents, among black voters in Alabama in general, as this fight has played [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=344.9s)]
*  out the way it has? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=350.84s)]
*  Disappointment, disgust, but not surprised. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=353.84s)]
*  There's interesting context here that many African Americans who occupy elected spaces [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=358.62s)]
*  in Alabama are representing districts that are majority minority and that were created [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=365.76s)]
*  by court orders. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=371.34s)]
*  Some lawsuits that were filed years ago. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  The 7th congressional district itself was a district created by a lawsuit and a court [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=377.18s)]
*  order. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=383.02s)]
*  And interestingly enough, not only is the black voting age population in the newly created [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=384.02s)]
*  second congressional district 39%, but the 7th congressional district that was created [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=391.58s)]
*  by a court order for the specific purpose of electing an African American saw its black [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=399.42s)]
*  voting age population in this new map go from 55% to 50, which is just another, you know, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  just outright slap in the face if you're considering the fight and the history that Alabama shares [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=410.98s)]
*  with the rest of the country in terms of courts and the federal government having to force [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  Alabama to do the right thing in situations like this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  So it is not surprised but still disappointment in the fact that Alabama once again gets to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=427.66s)]
*  this crucial threshold and fails to do the right thing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  Alabama State Representative Chris England. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=438.66s)]
*  Sir, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  I know this is not over. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=443.5s)]
*  We'd love to have you back and keep us surprised as this fight keeps playing out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=444.74s)]
*  Oh yeah, anytime. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=448.58000000000004s)]
*  I got a lot more to say. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  Good. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=451.58000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  We'll have you back, sir. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=453.58000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AqyzpMwsmQ&t=457.54s)]
