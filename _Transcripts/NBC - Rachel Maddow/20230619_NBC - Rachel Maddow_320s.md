# Book shows Putin broke unwritten rule with plot to kill defector on U.S. soil: NYT
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k)
*  The New York Times today confirmed remarkable reporting that's set to appear in a soon-to-be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=0.0s)]
*  published book. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=4.16s)]
*  It recounts a failed plot by the Kremlin to assassinate a former Russian intelligence [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=6.08s)]
*  official who became a CIA informant. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  The remarkable thing, in terms of modern Russian history, is not that they decided that they [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=14.86s)]
*  wanted to go kill the guy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=19.16s)]
*  It's that they decided, apparently, that they wanted to try to kill the guy here on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  U.S. soil, in the United States. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=24.32s)]
*  That Russian intelligence officer had disclosed information to the U.S. government that resulted [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=27.18s)]
*  in the FBI uncovering a bunch of Russian spies who were living here in the U.S. under deep [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=30.98s)]
*  cover. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=35.5s)]
*  Not surprisingly, the Russian government was not too pleased about that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=37.22s)]
*  But what we learned today is that, apparently, in 2020, an attempt was made to take him out [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=40.1s)]
*  on American soil in Miami. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=46.3s)]
*  Now, that plot did not succeed. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=49.18s)]
*  But still, trying it here means something. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=54.64s)]
*  And in a way, maybe this shouldn't be all that surprising. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  Given Russia's previous patterns, we know what they're willing to do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=61.02s)]
*  But it does open, really, a whole new can of worms in terms of our relationship with [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=65.34s)]
*  them and what the implications of this might be. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  This is a new Rubicon that they have crossed here in the United States. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=72.26s)]
*  Joining us now is Mark Polymeropoulos. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=77.30000000000001s)]
*  He's a former CIA chief of operations in Europe and Eurasia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=79.22s)]
*  Lots of experience dealing with the Russian government in all sorts of ways he can't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=82.86s)]
*  talk about. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Polymeropoulos, I really appreciate you being on the show with us tonight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=90.18s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=91.18s)]
*  So as I mentioned, we know about Russian efforts to track down and kill people or try to kill [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=94.14s)]
*  them not just in Russia, but in places like Germany and places like the U.K. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  As a former CIA chief who has real expertise in this field, does it strike you as significant? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=105.9s)]
*  Is this something new and important that they've apparently tried to do the same thing in the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=111.54s)]
*  United States? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, Rachel, I think so. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  For a long time, we saw Europe as kind of Russia's intelligence playground. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=118.5s)]
*  And as you very artfully stated, there were successful and unsuccessful assassination [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=123.06s)]
*  operations in the U.K. and in Germany. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=129.06s)]
*  Russia never was deterred from doing this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=134.62s)]
*  There would be tit for tat expulsions declaring Russian intelligence officers persona non [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=137.46s)]
*  grata from countries, but they were never deterred. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  And so as they've kind of expanded this hybrid warfare, it looks as though they tried to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=145.3s)]
*  recruit a support asset to, in essence, obtain pattern of life on an alleged defector who [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=149.34s)]
*  is living in Miami. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  It means trying to figure out for a future assassination team where this individual lived, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  how he parked his car, just everyday moves, for something that a lot of us thought was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=164.54s)]
*  kind of out of bounds, which would be kind of such Russian activity in the U.S. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  And Rachel, I'll say something, and I think a lot of people don't understand this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=174.54s)]
*  With Russian defectors, with any defectors, the CIA is allowed to, in essence, parole [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  into our country, up to 100 defectors a year. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=181.98s)]
*  It's a large number, and that's really not important. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=185.54s)]
*  But that also means that we give them permanent residence, and that's a path to citizenship. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=188.38s)]
*  So in essence, the Russians not only were trying to kill a defector, a former officer [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=192.7s)]
*  of their intelligence service, this is also a U.S. citizen, and that should alarm a lot [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=198.26s)]
*  of people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  Is it also, I mean, given that he's a defector, the CIA essentially takes responsibility for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  him, brings him into the U.S., brings him in and installs him here as a permanent resident, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=211.78s)]
*  potentially as a U.S. citizen, in a way that's supposed to be safe from reprisal by the country [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=216.7s)]
*  from which he defected. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=221.98s)]
*  Is it surprising to you that the Kremlin was able to apparently dispatch somebody to get [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=223.42s)]
*  this close to him, apparently as part of an assassination plot? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=228.7s)]
*  Shouldn't he have been more protected? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, the answer, of course, is yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure that the intelligence community tightened up its procedures. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  And of course, the operation was not successful. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=239.78s)]
*  One of the things that we've seen over the years with defectors, of course, is that they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  don't always follow the rules. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=248.1s)]
*  They miss home. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they do things that open them up to eventually kind of their home country, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=251.74s)]
*  finding out where they are. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=258.5s)]
*  But really, generally in the United States, they still were considered untouchable. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=259.5s)]
*  And that's what I think is so troubling here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=263.66s)]
*  Look, Vladimir Putin has a pathological hatred of defectors. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=266.58000000000004s)]
*  He's a former intelligence officer. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=270.42s)]
*  This goes to kind of his DNA. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=271.76s)]
*  And he clearly has made the decision to kind of cross that Rubicon and go after individuals [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=274.74s)]
*  in the United States. And we have to now up our game and ensure that these individuals, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  these were agents of ours. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  We have a sacrosanct responsibility to protect them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  We've got to do that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=287.74s)]
*  Mark Polymeropoulos, former CIA chief of operations in Europe and Eurasia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=290.74s)]
*  Mark, invaluable to have your expertise on this story tonight. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=295.54s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tm6yfVZF6k&t=298.62s)]
