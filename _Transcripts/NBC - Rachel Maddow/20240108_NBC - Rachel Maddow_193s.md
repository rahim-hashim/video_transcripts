# Special Counsel Jack Smith among spate of officials targeted by holiday hoax 'swatting': NBC News
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc)
*  The latest wave started on Christmas Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=0.0s)]
*  Police and ambulances came screaming up to the home of the mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=3.0s)]
*  They were responding to a 911 call about a shooting inside her home. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=8.0s)]
*  There had been no shooting inside her home. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=12.0s)]
*  The call was a hoax. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=14.0s)]
*  It was designed to provoke a scary and potentially dangerous police response. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=17.0s)]
*  That same day, Christmas Day, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=21.0s)]
*  also reported being the victim of a similar hoax 911 call. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=25.0s)]
*  A couple days later, it was Florida U.S. Senator Rick Scott who had police called to his house [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=29.0s)]
*  for, again, a non-existent reported shooting. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=33.0s)]
*  That same day, the same thing happened at the home of Georgia's Republican Lieutenant Governor. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=37.0s)]
*  For good measure, a bomb threat was called into his office the next morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=41.0s)]
*  Two days later, it was the Secretary of State of Maine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=45.0s)]
*  That call drew emergency responders to her home just a day after she announced [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=48.0s)]
*  she was barring Donald Trump from the state's ballot because of his role in the attack on Congress [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=52.0s)]
*  on January 6, 2021. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=57.0s)]
*  The following day, December 30, it was police swarming the home of California's Lieutenant Governor [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=60.0s)]
*  after a false report of a shooting at that home. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=64.0s)]
*  That call came after California's Lieutenant Governor also called for Trump to be barred from California's ballot. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=67.0s)]
*  Then last night, at about 10 o'clock, police and fire vehicles descended on the Washington home [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=74.0s)]
*  of the federal judge who was overseeing Trump's January 6 case in D.C. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=80.0s)]
*  Once again, a fake report of a shooting had been called in. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=86.0s)]
*  Nothing was amiss at the judge's home, but it provoked a massive and dangerous police response. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=90.0s)]
*  It's called swatting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=97.0s)]
*  It's calling in fake emergencies to draw an armed police response, hopefully a SWAT team response, to somebody's home. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=99.0s)]
*  Armed police rushing into what they believe is a very dangerous active shooter situation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=106.0s)]
*  It's always scary. It's always risky. It's something that has had fatal consequences in the past. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=112.0s)]
*  And we right now are in the midst of a spree of swatting calls to state and federal officials, including judges. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=117.0s)]
*  And in fact, on that score, we have some breaking news for you tonight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=124.0s)]
*  NBC News is now reporting that it is not just the federal judge in Trump's federal January 6 case who has been attacked like this in recent days. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=128.0s)]
*  It is also special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=136.0s)]
*  We can now report Jack Smith was also the victim of an attempted swatting at his Washington area home on Christmas Day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=138.0s)]
*  Two law enforcement officials telling, excuse me, two law enforcement sources telling NBC News that someone called 911 that day, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=145.0s)]
*  reporting that Jack Smith had shot his wife at the address where Smith lives. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=152.0s)]
*  Local police did dispatch units toward the home. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=158.0s)]
*  They were called off when deputy U.S. Marshals protecting Smith and his family told police it was a false alarm. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=161.0s)]
*  No arrests have been made. A spokesperson for the special counsel's office is declining to comment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lhCTwCfUFc&t=167.0s)]
