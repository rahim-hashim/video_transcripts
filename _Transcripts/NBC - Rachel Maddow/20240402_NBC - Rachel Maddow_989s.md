# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 1
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI)
*  Right off the top, there has been some breaking news just in the last hour or so in a couple of the legal cases involving former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=0.0s)]
*  One of these we've been watching now for a few weeks. He lost a big fraud case against his company a few weeks ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=8.28s)]
*  There were huge financial penalties that he's been ordered to pay in that case. He is going to appeal the judgment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=13.8s)]
*  He's going to appeal the ruling in that case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=20.94s)]
*  But he, in the meantime, has to put up a bond while he files that appeal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=22.8s)]
*  And we've been watching this because the amount of the judgment against him was so huge, the bond he has to put up is huge, roughly a half billion dollars. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=28.0s)]
*  So his lawyers told the court as the deadline for filing that bond, for posting that bond approach, his lawyers told the court that they'd been unable to obtain the bond. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=37.2s)]
*  They said they had reached out to 30 different insurance companies, but nobody would help him post a bond of that size. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=47.64s)]
*  At that point, it looked like New York's attorney general, who brought this fraud case in the first place, the AG might be about to start seizing Trump's bank accounts and seizing his properties to secure the judgment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=55.72s)]
*  But then, you may recall, there was sort of a last minute reprieve for Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=70.4s)]
*  A New York appeals court lowered the bond to less than half of what had originally been ordered. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=74.56s)]
*  They did not explain why they were doing that, but that's what they did. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=79.88s)]
*  They brought the bond amount down from nearly 500 million dollars to 175 million dollars. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=83.8s)]
*  That would be all that Trump would have to put up while he appeals this fraud judgment against him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=91.44s)]
*  They also, in addition to reducing the amount that he had to put up, they gave him more time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  The deadline was extended. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  So he would have to later this week to put up that new 175 million dollar bond. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=103.0s)]
*  Well, as of this last hour, we just got confirmation in court documents that Trump has posted that reduced amount of bond. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=109.04s)]
*  He secured a 175 million dollar bond through something called Knight Specialty Insurance Company in Los Angeles. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=115.92s)]
*  Knight, K-N-I-G-H-T, Knight Specialty Insurance. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=124.92s)]
*  That company is part of an insurance group that is chaired by a major Republican donor. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=128.32s)]
*  Make of that what you will. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=135.68s)]
*  But that move tonight would appear to mean that the former president has satisfied his financial obligations in that huge fraud case for now, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=137.96s)]
*  at least until his appeal is heard. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=147.52s)]
*  And that is not expected to be at least until this fall. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=149.24s)]
*  So that's one of the two big developments that's just happened this evening. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=153.48s)]
*  There's another in Trump's other New York state case, which is a criminal case, not a civil case. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=156.52s)]
*  This is the hush money case that is due to start two weeks from today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  The judge in that case has tonight just issued an expanded gag order on Mr. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump. Last week, this judge issued an order that banned Trump from attacking witnesses or prosecutors or jurors or court staff, as well as their relatives. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=173.12s)]
*  After that gag order, Trump started publicly attacking not only the judge, who actually is and remains sort of fair game for criticism under the gag order, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=183.52s)]
*  but he also repeatedly went after the judge's daughter, including identifying her by name on social media. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=196.28s)]
*  Now, the New York District Attorney, the prosecutor, has brought this case, asked the judge to expand the gag order to include family members of the judge [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=203.56s)]
*  and family members of the DA, of the prosecutor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=213.08s)]
*  Tonight, the judge has done just that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=216.44000000000003s)]
*  So, again, the gag order still doesn't apply to the judge himself or the prosecutor himself, but it does now include their families. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  In expanding the gag order in that way, the judge did not mince words. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  He said tonight, quote, This pattern of attacking family members, of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=230.0s)]
*  It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings that not only they but their family members as well are, quote, fair game for defendants. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Vitriol, the average observer, must now, after hearing defendants recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=249.44s)]
*  they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=259.52s)]
*  Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=263.76s)]
*  It constitutes direct attack on the rule of law itself. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=268.55999999999995s)]
*  Again, that that case, that criminal case, the first ever criminal case brought against a former president of the United States, it is slated to get underway in a New York courtroom two weeks from today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=274.55999999999995s)]
*  That's when jury selection will start the judge tonight, making clear that attacks on his family members or family members of the prosecutor will henceforth be considered. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=284.76s)]
*  They will not be tolerated and will be subject to punishment by the court if they continue. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=293.28s)]
*  They're still doing it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=299.96s)]
*  I mean, we reported here a couple of weeks ago on the renewed efforts by Russia to target American elections once again, to try to promote Trump's candidacy and to try to hurt his Democratic opponent. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=301.32s)]
*  And it's not like I was reporting on some obscure thing a couple of weeks ago when we covered that story. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=313.44s)]
*  There it is, headline in the New York Times, spate of mock news sites with Russian ties pop up in the United States. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=318.36s)]
*  Russia's still doing it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=326.36s)]
*  They're doing it again, and it is as ham handed and embarrassing as it ever was. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=328.2s)]
*  And they're doing it for the same transparently obvious strategic reasons as they do everything. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  The difference is this time, forewarned is supposedly forearmed, right? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=342.44s)]
*  Knowing that it's coming should make us better prepared. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=346.36s)]
*  Except this time around, some social media companies, particularly Twitter, have no interest at all in even trying to stop what they're doing to target the election this time around. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=349.88s)]
*  And this time around, many Republicans seem to have lost any qualms they might once have had about helping out with what Russia is doing, even with the really obviously fake stuff. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=359.92s)]
*  But now here's something new. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=374.8s)]
*  Something new on top of that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=377.36s)]
*  It is no longer just Russia. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  Because why would it be, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=382.16s)]
*  I mean, the way it's gone, why wouldn't other authoritarian countries who want to weaken the United States and want to denigrate democracy and want to try to get Trump back into the White House, why wouldn't they throw their hats in the ring, too? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=383.32s)]
*  It's not like Russia's paid much of a price for it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=393.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=396.6s)]
*  Russia appears to have purchased themselves a significant chunk of one of the two major governing parties in the United States for the price of a few sanctions and a few intelligence officers being unable to travel. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=396.8s)]
*  For fear of arrest. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  That's basically the price they've paid for the Republican Party and the conservative movement hopping into bed with them in a very serious way. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  That's cheap if you're willing to buy it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=417.23999999999995s)]
*  And so, of course, it's no longer just them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=419.84s)]
*  Headline today in The New York Times. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=425.64s)]
*  China's advancing efforts to influence US election raise alarms. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=428.32s)]
*  Researchers and government officials say China has adopted some of the same misinformation tactics that Russia used ahead of the 2016 election. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  Covert Chinese accounts are masquerading online as American supporters of former President Donald J. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump, promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November, according to researchers and government officials. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=448.92s)]
*  The accounts signal a potential tactical shift and how China aims to influence American politics with more of a willingness to target specific candidates and parties, including Mr. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=458.88s)]
*  Biden. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=469.24s)]
*  In an echo of Russia's influence campaign before the 2016 election, China appears to be trying to harness partisan divisions to undermine the Biden administration's policies. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=470.24s)]
*  Some of these Chinese accounts impersonate fervent Trump fans, including one on Twitter that purports to be a quote, father, husband and son, who is quote, MAGA all the way. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=480.2s)]
*  The accounts mocked Mr. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=492.56s)]
*  Biden's age and shared fake images of him in a prison jumpsuit or claimed that Mr. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=493.91999999999996s)]
*  Biden was a Satanist pedophile while promoting Mr. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=499.67999999999995s)]
*  Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  Here's one of these these China linked accounts described by these researchers promoting that Trump video over the weekend that showed an image of President Biden tied up hand and foot as if you're as if you were being kidnapped or held hostage. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=507.56s)]
*  Here's another one of the China linked accounts showing a different video, one for Easter. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=521.36s)]
*  It's an animated video that shows President Biden being assaulted and beaten up by a giant Easter bunny. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=527.36s)]
*  And I'm not going to show you the video because it's violence against the President of the United States. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=534.12s)]
*  And yeah, it's for Easter. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=538.28s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=539.8s)]
*  But it shows the president falling down and looking hurt and being pummeled. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=540.36s)]
*  The New York Times reporting that researchers have linked this new activity to a quote, long running network of accounts connected with the Chinese government. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=546.32s)]
*  The accounts are not always great at disguising the fact that they're actually Chinese. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=556.04s)]
*  Like in this instance where they're trying to look like an American account, you see the name at the top there with the little eagle and the American flags. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=560.28s)]
*  It says, Liam, Republican Party, America first, the American flags, the American eagle. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=569.16s)]
*  And this post is an attempt by this account to reply to a Trump video with basically a big, a big attaboy. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=576.12s)]
*  Seventy five million Trump fans can't be wrong. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=584.4399999999999s)]
*  The problem with this is that they forgot they weren't supposed to be typing in Chinese. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=587.36s)]
*  They weren't supposed to be typing in Mandarin. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=591.24s)]
*  So it's only the Google Translate that tells you what it says. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=593.4000000000001s)]
*  Oops. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=595.96s)]
*  If you're trying to be Liam, Republican Party, American first, maybe toggle back to English before you post your compliments to President Trump. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=597.08s)]
*  The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, which has done some of the research quoted in the New York Times today, particularly about these campaigns, operations on Facebook, also notes that the influence operation [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  appears to be active almost exclusively during business hours in China, during business hours Beijing time. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=616.76s)]
*  All their posts appear here in for us. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=623.6s)]
*  What are the overnight hours? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=627.0s)]
*  But those hours correspond to the work starting at 850 a.m. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=629.04s)]
*  Beijing time, stopping at 6 p.m. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=634.48s)]
*  Beijing time with an hour off for lunch from noon to one local time during which they don't post at all. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=636.96s)]
*  So these are accounts and users that are occasionally lapsing into Chinese or forgetting to turn off the settings that show that their web browsers are set to operate in Mandarin. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  They're operating on Chinese business hours, including a nice solid hour for Chinese lunch. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=654.48s)]
*  They appear pretty obviously linked to Chinese government influence operations. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  But what they're doing now this year is trying to mess with our election. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  To try to help Trump get back in there and to hurt Joe Biden's chances. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=670.48s)]
*  Just like Russia has been doing since 2016. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  And the Trump years have shown us thus far that we have proven to be, forgive me, but we have proven to be not just inept, but spineless. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=682.4s)]
*  When it comes to putting up with this from one authoritarian country that wants the worst for us, what are we going to do now that it's two of them at once? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=693.56s)]
*  Both pulling for Trump. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=702.68s)]
*  Joining us now is Tiffany Xu. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  She's a technology reporter at the New York Times who's reported out this and other stories on the same topic. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  Miss Xu, thank you very much for being here. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=711.3599999999999s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=712.8s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=714.68s)]
*  So what is the evidence, as you understand it, that this appears to be linked to not just operators in China, but to the Chinese state? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=716.44s)]
*  Well, like you said, there have been some slip ups in these accounts. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=727.32s)]
*  Several of these accounts are many, many years old. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=730.48s)]
*  And for a while they host exclusively in Mandarin. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=732.96s)]
*  The narrative is very pro-Beijing. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=736.32s)]
*  It lapses at some point into the Chinese economy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=739.12s)]
*  It's pro-Beijing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=742.0s)]
*  It lapses at some point into America is bad. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=743.72s)]
*  All of this is in Mandarin. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=747.24s)]
*  And then they go quiet for a few months and then suddenly reemerge, posting as Liam or Ben, MAGA all the way. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=749.36s)]
*  I'm a husband, father. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=757.56s)]
*  I'm 43 years old. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=759.0s)]
*  I'm living in Los Angeles. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=760.0s)]
*  These very convincing accounts that are masquerading as Americans, posting entirely in English. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=761.16s)]
*  So they adopt these personalities that unless you're a researcher or a journalist and your entire job is to look for clues that you're not in authentic account, for the average social media users, you're like, yeah, this is a person who supports President Trump just like me. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=768.88s)]
*  I'm going to listen in to what they have to say. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=785.88s)]
*  And I've been focusing in trying to understand this on some of the elements of it that are ham handed or that are that appear to be mistakes, letting it slip. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=789.6s)]
*  Accidentally showing that your browser set to Mandarin or sometimes accidentally posting in Mandarin. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=798.72s)]
*  That interesting detail that was identified by the Foundation for Defending Democracies about them posting mostly on Beijing time, except not during their lunch hour. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=804.08s)]
*  I've been focusing on the things that kind of show it to be Chinese operations. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=813.64s)]
*  But as you're saying, some of these personalities and some of the idiom they're using can be sort of convincing. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=817.72s)]
*  Are they getting better at this? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=823.8000000000001s)]
*  Are these things improving over time in terms of their ability to masquerade as Americans? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=825.64s)]
*  Oh, leaps and bounds beyond what the Chinese used to be capable of. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=831.76s)]
*  I mean, if the Russians are seen as being ham handed, they're like the teenager who's like, oh, mom, yeah, I was totally studying at the library and not drinking at a party with my friends. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=835.8000000000001s)]
*  Then the Chinese for a long time were the toddler who was covered in paint saying, no, no, mommy, I didn't just paint the entire wall like you told me not to. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=846.12s)]
*  Like very, very enthusiastic, but very see through. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=855.2s)]
*  But they're doing now is is a step change in their capabilities. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=859.52s)]
*  Right. The Chinese used to spread this narrative that was very pro Beijing. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=864.48s)]
*  It was very much this is the Beijing party line. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=868.6s)]
*  China is great. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=872.36s)]
*  You know, back all of our policies and our philosophies. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=873.8s)]
*  A couple of years ago, they shifted to Beijing is good, but America is also bad. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=877.2s)]
*  And so you see them start getting involved in the American culture wars, trying to weigh in on, you know, gay rights on crime in the U.S. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  But what they're doing now is focusing on specific candidates, which is not something most researchers have seen them do. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=893.6s)]
*  Right. They're they're adopting these these personalities that seem like real Americans, and they're trying to and often successfully generate real engagement from real people. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, one of these accounts was retweeted by Alex Jones. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=910.92s)]
*  He has two point two million followers. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=914.04s)]
*  So so the idea that people, including people who have huge audiences, are interpreting these accounts as real voices is pretty concerning to people who've looked at China as kind of an inept influence operator for a long time. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=916.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's concerning not only that it's working, but it's concerning to have what appears to be a state directed effort like this [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=935.0s)]
*  focused in this way at this time ahead of the election. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=944.28s)]
*  It really does feel like we haven't learned much. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  But I learned a lot about it from you today and from this reporting. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=950.0799999999999s)]
*  I hope you come back and talk to us about this as you continue this this work. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=952.52s)]
*  It's fascinating and important stuff. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=955.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM6d9nWEEiI&t=957.28s)]
