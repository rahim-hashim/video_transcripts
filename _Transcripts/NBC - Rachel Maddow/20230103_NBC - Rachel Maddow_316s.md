# 'Profoundly productive' Democratic Congress closes with admirable record
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4)
*  This one key bridge connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=0.0s)]
*  on the northern side of the Ohio River, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=4.44s)]
*  and the northern nub of Kentucky [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=6.48s)]
*  on the southern side of the river, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=8.8s)]
*  that one important bridge has been functionally obsolete [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  for more than two decades. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It has supposedly been a national priority [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=15.48s)]
*  to fix this thing for more than two decades. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Never gets done. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=20.28s)]
*  Except now, apparently it's getting done. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=22.76s)]
*  They're cutting the checks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=26.0s)]
*  The day after tomorrow, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=27.28s)]
*  there is going to be a political miracle. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=28.56s)]
*  The day after tomorrow, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=31.64s)]
*  President Biden will be at that bridge, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Wednesday this week, with two governors, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=35.24s)]
*  Democratic Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=38.08s)]
*  and Republican Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=40.16s)]
*  And he will be there with two senators, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=43.0s)]
*  Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell from Kentucky [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  and Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats together, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=51.0s)]
*  cats and dogs living in harmony, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=53.24s)]
*  formally announcing the fact [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=55.4s)]
*  that the bipartisan infrastructure bill [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=57.2s)]
*  that President Biden got passed this past year [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=59.6s)]
*  is finally gonna be the thing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=62.88s)]
*  that fixes that freaking bridge. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=64.36s)]
*  $1.6 billion to fix this thing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=66.36s)]
*  They're gonna build a second bridge [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  alongside the Brent Spence bridge, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  and they're gonna repair the original Brent Spence. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Groundbreaking is set for later this year. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=76.88s)]
*  They're announcing it this week. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=78.68s)]
*  Finally, decades after everyone agreed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=80.36s)]
*  it needed to be done, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=83.96s)]
*  and it was dangerous to not do it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=85.44s)]
*  and it was super expensive not to do it, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  finally, finally, finally, they are going to do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=90.36s)]
*  Cincinnati's Mayor, Aftab Purval, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=95.36s)]
*  just put out a statement about it, saying, quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  they got it done when for years others could not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  They got it done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=105.24s)]
*  It's a miracle. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  In America, this passes for a miracle. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=108.8s)]
*  Or maybe it shouldn't anymore. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=111.63999999999999s)]
*  For all the catawalling about Congress [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=114.64s)]
*  not getting anything done and about Congress being broken [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=116.52s)]
*  and Washington being broken, blah, blah, blah, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=119.16s)]
*  this last Congress kind of did get a lot done. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=121.92s)]
*  It got that bipartisan infrastructure bill done, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=124.92s)]
*  A trillion dollar infrastructure bill. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=128.56s)]
*  $27 billion alone just for fixing bridges, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=130.76s)]
*  like the hugely expensive, totally necessary, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=134.56s)]
*  Brent Spence bridge that everybody's been saying [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=137.84s)]
*  they desperately needed to do for decades. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=140.4s)]
*  They're doing it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=142.72s)]
*  And it wasn't just that, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=144.52s)]
*  they got the Chips and Science Act, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=145.36s)]
*  The CHIPS Act, so the US can start making microchips again [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=147.6s)]
*  instead of being totally dependent on China for that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  Also, burn pits coverage for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  they finally got that done. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  That's also taken decades. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=157.36s)]
*  They reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  that shouldn't be hard, but in recent years it has been. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=161.32s)]
*  They passed the first gun safety reforms [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  in nearly 30 years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=166.0s)]
*  They did the freaking post office reform bill, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=168.24s)]
*  which they also needed to do for decades [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=170.88s)]
*  and should not have been hard, but they finally did it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=173.04s)]
*  They also passed a federal law to protect marriage rights, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=175.56s)]
*  which shouldn't be necessary, but it is, and they did it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=178.24s)]
*  And all those things in that list I just gave you, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=182.44s)]
*  those are all things they did on a bipartisan basis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=184.28s)]
*  And yes, there were some things [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=188.48s)]
*  that the Republicans wouldn't do [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=190.24s)]
*  and Democrats had to do them alone, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  but they did them too, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=194.04s)]
*  like confirming the nation's first black woman [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=195.48s)]
*  to the United States Supreme Court, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, they got that done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=199.76s)]
*  Also the American Rescue Plan, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=202.76s)]
*  $400 billion worth of COVID aid, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=205.32s)]
*  $20 billion to fund the national vaccine effort. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  A national vaccine effort that is now credited [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=213.44s)]
*  with keeping alive 3 million Americans [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  who would otherwise be dead because of COVID. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=218.72s)]
*  Democrats also got passed the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=222.64s)]
*  which is not only the best climate change legislation [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=225.56s)]
*  ever passed in the United States by a mile, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=228.48s)]
*  it's the reason that as of yesterday, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=230.92s)]
*  your costs for insulin are capped at $35 a month [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=232.76s)]
*  if you're on Medicare, and your prescription drug costs [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  overall for the entire year are capped at $2,000. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=238.6s)]
*  Mostly in bipartisan effort, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=243.72s)]
*  but some of it just with the Democrats acting alone, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=245.72s)]
*  this one Congress over these past two years [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=248.28s)]
*  got all that stuff done. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  Even with the Senate just being a 50-50 split, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=252.56s)]
*  they were able to get all that stuff done, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=256.12s)]
*  and they're finally gonna fix [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=257.6s)]
*  that fricking fracking bridge, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=258.92s)]
*  which nobody's been able to do for decades, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=260.4s)]
*  even as presidents have repeatedly singled it out by name [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=264.2s)]
*  and said they would get it done. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=267.88s)]
*  They've done kind of a lot in these last couple of years. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=271.2s)]
*  Who says Washington's broken? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=274.0s)]
*  This past Congress got a lot done. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=276.52s)]
*  A lot of stuff that people said couldn't get done, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=279.24s)]
*  they got it done. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=281.48s)]
*  And at noon tomorrow, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=283.08s)]
*  by the power vested in the United States Constitution, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=285.28s)]
*  this Congress, this profoundly productive Congress [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=288.12s)]
*  will poof into the history books. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=292.2s)]
*  ["The New York Times"] [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSyRuPUJXP4&t=295.79999999999995s)]
