# Hackers Humiliate Putin; Prominent Media Vandalized On Russian Holiday
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo)
*  This was today in Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=0.0s)]
*  This happened on at least three different major TV providers in Russia today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=4.0s)]
*  The grid looks at first like the normal rundown of channels and shows. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=8.0s)]
*  But if you go, for example, to Channel One, if you go to any of the other big state-sponsored TV channels, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=12.0s)]
*  it looks on the grid like every single program has the same name. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=18.0s)]
*  For all the channels, for all the time slots, all the shows now have the same name. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=21.0s)]
*  I mean, if you don't read Russian, you can see that they're all the same. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=27.0s)]
*  I don't read Russian, but we had it translated. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=31.0s)]
*  It turns out, according to your TV today in Russia, every single show on every single station [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=34.0s)]
*  and every time slot was titled, On Your Hands Is the Blood of Thousands of Ukrainians [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=40.0s)]
*  and Hundreds of Their Murdered Children, TV and the Authorities Are Lying, No to War. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=45.0s)]
*  That was the title of every show on Russian television today, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=51.0s)]
*  according to everybody's TV grid when they turned on their TVs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=55.0s)]
*  Somebody hacked at least three of the biggest cable TV providers in Russia today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=59.0s)]
*  So that is what it looked like all over Russia when people went to flip on the tube [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=64.0s)]
*  to see what was on, to see what the options were. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=68.0s)]
*  Also today, a fairly major Russian news outlet, one called Lenta, L-E-N-T-A. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=72.0s)]
*  This is their website, lenta.ru. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=80.0s)]
*  And today, same day that somebody hacked all the TVs in Russia, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=83.0s)]
*  today somebody also rewrote what appeared to be dozens of headlines [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=86.0s)]
*  and dozens of articles on the Lenta News website. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=91.0s)]
*  Now, as you know, as we've been reporting here for the last couple of months, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=95.0s)]
*  no independent media is allowed to operate anymore in Russia. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=100.0s)]
*  Putin has made it literally a crime, a crime punishable by 15 years in prison [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=103.0s)]
*  to report on his war in Ukraine or even to call it a war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=109.0s)]
*  But look at what the Lenta website looked like earlier today in Russia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=113.0s)]
*  Now, this is with English translation, so you can see what these headlines look at. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=119.0s)]
*  But oh boy, wow, this isn't normal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=124.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin lied about Russia's plans in Ukraine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=126.0s)]
*  Putin unleashed one of the bloodiest wars of the 21st century. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=129.0s)]
*  These are all the headlines on the news website today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=132.0s)]
*  Record spending on the army did not help Russia defeat Ukraine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=134.0s)]
*  The Ministry of Defense lied to the relatives of those killed on the cruiser Moskva, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=138.0s)]
*  that big Russian naval ship that was sunk by a Ukrainian missile. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=142.0s)]
*  Also this one, Russia completely destroyed the city of Mariupol. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=146.0s)]
*  Russia leaves the corpses of its soldiers in Ukraine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=151.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is afraid to reveal the truth about his family. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=154.0s)]
*  Putin turned the state into the main robber, meaning like the main thief, of Russians. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=158.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has turned into a pathetic dictator and paranoid. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=163.0s)]
*  Russia threatens to destroy the whole world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=167.0s)]
*  Zelensky turned out to be cooler than Putin. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=170.0s)]
*  War makes it easier to cover up failures in the economy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=173.0s)]
*  Putin must go. He unleashed a senseless war and is leading Russia into the abyss. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=177.0s)]
*  Again, this was all today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=183.0s)]
*  Those were all separate headlines today on one of the biggest pro-Kremlin state controlled news sites in Russia. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=186.0s)]
*  And it wasn't just the headlines that they changed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=192.0s)]
*  Each one of those that I just described to you, each one of those headlines I just read, goes to a full article. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=195.0s)]
*  That has also been rewritten. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=201.0s)]
*  I mean, in a country where they do not allow journalism anymore, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=204.0s)]
*  they do not allow criticism of the government and especially of the war, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=207.0s)]
*  these sentences posted today on a Russian news site, these were like a DEFCON 1 level threat to the state. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=210.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=217.0s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin bears full responsibility for the senseless and bloody war against Ukraine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=219.0s)]
*  Guided by far-fetched pretexts about threats to Russia, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=225.0s)]
*  the head of state plunged two neighboring peoples into a war in which there will be no winners, only losers. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=229.0s)]
*  The president's decision will cost the country isolation, poverty, and a rollback to the very 90s that Putin loves to scare Russians with. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=234.0s)]
*  In more than 20 years of his reign, he has turned into a dictator [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=242.0s)]
*  who began to believe in conspiracy theories and who lost touch with reality. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=246.0s)]
*  Right now, Putin is depriving millions of Russians of their future and taking the lives of innocent Ukrainians. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=250.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin must immediately stop the war and resign. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=257.0s)]
*  It is one thing to read that in a Western news source [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=262.0s)]
*  or to read that in any news source in the world anywhere other than in Russia, but to read that in Russia? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=266.0s)]
*  But again, today that was a Russian major news site today altered to include that article and dozens of others like it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=273.0s)]
*  And if you started going through them, you noticed that there were a few things that were consistent in each of the new articles that was posted. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=281.0s)]
*  For example, near the top of each of the articles that was posted on this Russian news site today, there was a disclaimer warning that this had been posted without the permission of the news organization, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=288.0s)]
*  saying that it was definitely going to be taken down. So if you want to read this, take a screenshot of it immediately because this won't last. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=298.0s)]
*  And indeed, that disclaimer was true. All those articles and headlines were almost immediately taken down off that Russian news site today. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=304.0s)]
*  But they were up there for long enough that the great and good people at the Internet Archive, the way back machine, they captured and saved all of it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=311.0s)]
*  They've got screenshots. They've got the historical record of what those news sites looked like [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=320.0s)]
*  when the truthful anti-Putin stuff was posted just for moments. And in this case, what's fascinating is that we know who did it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=325.0s)]
*  Two journalists, two young journalists who used to work for Lenta for this news organization, they say that they did it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=333.0s)]
*  They have reportedly fled Russia. They are outside Russia personally. They apparently still had logins to access the news site. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=343.0s)]
*  So that is how they did it. They obviously prepared all this material, logged in, uploaded everything, logged out and got out. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=350.0s)]
*  But they posted today identifying themselves by name as the people who did it, Igor Polyakov and Alexandra Mirochnikova. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=357.0s)]
*  They gave their names. They stood up and said, we're the ones who did this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=369.0s)]
*  And then they said, quote, we are looking for work and lawyers and probably political asylum. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=375.0s)]
*  And then they sign off with this, quote, do not be afraid, do not be silent, resist. You are not alone. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=383.0s)]
*  We are many. The future is ours. F war. Peace to Ukraine. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=388.0s)]
*  And we do not know where those two brave Russian journalists are tonight, the ones who did that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=394.0s)]
*  Again, it has been reported that they are outside Russia, but we do not know where they are. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=400.0s)]
*  We also don't know who hacked all the TVs in Russia today either. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=405.0s)]
*  But man, this is living manifest hope that bravery is contagious, that dictatorships are brittle, that they have to criminalize journalism and criticism of all kinds, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=409.0s)]
*  because they know it's powerful, because they know they can't survive the truth. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVzdmfmWCo&t=424.0s)]
