# Maddow: January 6 becomes marker of Trump's degradation of wall between violence and politics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ)
*  So, that's one thing to know about that video of what happened that day in Coral Gables. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The guy shooting the video, the guy screaming at Nancy Pelosi, filming people pounding on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=6.24s)]
*  the door to try to intimidate her, saying, the proud boys are there, that guy is now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  in prison for trying to overthrow the U.S. government. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=16.3s)]
*  But the other thing to know about that video is that the guy who he's actually filming [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=19.94s)]
*  doing the pounding on the door, this guy right here in the red circle, he has just been [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=24.0s)]
*  named by Donald Trump as his choice to be the next U.S. ambassador to the nation of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=29.78s)]
*  Panama. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=34.54s)]
*  Because apparently that is what our country is looking for in an ambassador now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Will you make yourself a physical menace for Donald Trump? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=42.56s)]
*  Now, that man who's now Donald Trump's ambassador pick, after this happened in Coral Gables, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=47.34s)]
*  he later defended his conduct there, saying he was just exercising his right to protest. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=56.74s)]
*  At the time it happened, though, in 2018, Republicans were quite embarrassed by this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=61.52s)]
*  The head of the Miami-Dade Republican Party apologized for being there, distanced himself [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=65.4s)]
*  from the proud boys. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=70.72s)]
*  Other Republicans, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, condemned the actions, said Republicans [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=72.72s)]
*  should never do anything physically intimidating like this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=78.54s)]
*  Well, now Marco Rubio is about to be nominated to be Donald Trump's secretary of state, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  where the guy pounding bloody murder on the door to try to scare Nancy Pelosi and smiling [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=88.8s)]
*  up at Enrique Tario when he says, it's the proud boys in here, that guy will be reporting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=93.88s)]
*  to Marco Rubio as one of America's next U.S. ambassadors. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=98.72s)]
*  And the reason that's repellent, the reason that is sort of instinctually repulsive to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=105.32s)]
*  us is because there's supposed to be a sharp line that keeps violent intimidation on one [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=111.64s)]
*  side of the line and politics on the other, and never the twain shall meet. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=117.92s)]
*  In a democratic country, those things are supposed to be separate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=122.32s)]
*  And so today, January 6th, the certification of the last presidential election happened [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=127.72s)]
*  in Washington, and it just happened ministerially and ceremonially like it's supposed to. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=133.68s)]
*  And that contrast with what happened today versus what happened four years ago makes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=141.94000000000003s)]
*  clear the profound difference between the two parties, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=150.18s)]
*  Had Democrats won the presidential election this year, the whole country openly expected [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  and was preparing for Republicans to go into violent, if not armed, revolt. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=160.06s)]
*  But because instead, Republicans won, everyone expected, and in fact, we saw today that Democrats [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=166.0s)]
*  would peacefully accept and participate in the transfer of power. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=172.0s)]
*  And when a whole country expects guaranteed violence if one side loses in an electoral [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  contest, then the two political parties in that contest are no longer competing in democratic [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=182.04s)]
*  terms anymore. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  One of those parties is a small D and capital D democratic party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=189.76s)]
*  The other party is something else. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=193.68s)]
*  So, that is part of what we are contending with on this January 6th. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=195.78s)]
*  How do we ever get our democracy back now? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=201.18s)]
*  Because we have, in effect, lost it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=203.58s)]
*  How do we ever get back to competition in democratic terms? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=205.9s)]
*  Which means specifically, how do we get the Republican Party and the Trumpist right to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=209.66s)]
*  no longer see physical force and armed conflict as the way they're going to get their way [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=215.22s)]
*  and hold power? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=219.86s)]
*  One big step backwards from that as a goal will be Trump's promised pardons of the people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=223.74s)]
*  who committed violence in his name on January 6, 2021, the ones who earned themselves that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=230.38s)]
*  bronze statue of Nancy Pelosi's desk on the National Mall that briefly memorialized [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  the physically repulsive and scatological nature of their actions inside the Capitol. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=242.02s)]
*  I mean, the argument now appears to be, in Republican circles, not whether Trump is going [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=248.54s)]
*  to issue pardons to people who took part in that attack on the Capitol, but just how many [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=255.64s)]
*  pardons he's going to issue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=259.64s)]
*  Will he pardon them all, or will he just pardon some of them? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  That has led publications as diverse as The Huffington Post and the Wall Street Journal [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=263.68s)]
*  editorial page to try to front page, to try to resurface the details of the crimes for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=268.36s)]
*  which some of these people were convicted, to try to make it seem even to Trump, even [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=274.8s)]
*  to Trumpist Republicans, like maybe these convictions were sound and should stand. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=279.14s)]
*  an 84-month sentence at the federal prison in Milan, Michigan. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=304.8s)]
*  Stephen Capuccio held his cell phone in his mouth so he could beat an officer using both [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=309.24s)]
*  of his hands, including with the officer's own baton. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=313.92s)]
*  He's doing 85 months at the federal prison in Forest City, Arkansas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  All three will be back on the streets if Donald Trump, the man who incited them and some 2,000 [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=322.6s)]
*  others to attack the Capitol in the first place, follows through on his oft-repeated [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=327.36s)]
*  pledge to pardon the January 6th insurrectionists. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=332.0s)]
*  Of those serving a year or more in prison, a full 57% are there following a conviction [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=336.04s)]
*  in cases involving an assault on a police officer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  In all, 83% serving a year or more were convicted of committing an act of violence, which means [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=345.24s)]
*  that with few exceptions, the only people Trump could release from prison with his pardons [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=353.44s)]
*  are those who attacked a police officer, possessed weapons or explosives, or were convicted [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=359.56s)]
*  of some other violent felony. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=364.96s)]
*  Are those going to be the ones he springs? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=368.84s)]
*  Here was the deeply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page today. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=372.8s)]
*  It's titled, Trump's Pardon Promise for January 6th Rioters. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=376.76s)]
*  Does it include the ex-Mef trafficker who brought a metal baton and swung it at police? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=381.44s)]
*  Quote, on December 20th, a prison sentence of 48 months was given to a 31-year-old man [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=388.32s)]
*  named Joshua Lee Atwood, who pled guilty to assaulting law enforcement. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=392.76s)]
*  He emptied a can of pepper spray at police, beat them with a pole and pelted them with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=396.76s)]
*  objects such as a metal scaffolding pipe. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=401.52s)]
*  He yelled that the cops were pieces of s— [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=405.08s)]
*  The prosecution's sentencing memo says his criminal history includes a pending felony [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=408.56s)]
*  case for an alleged 2023 stabbing. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=412.7s)]
*  On December 17th, meaning last month, a 60-month sentence was given to Michael Bradley, age [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=416.64s)]
*  50, who apparently went to the Capitol on January 6th with his own metal baton and a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  hip holster. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=427.24s)]
*  He swung it at police more than once. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=428.32s)]
*  His list of priors includes a 2002 conviction for meth trafficking. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=430.28s)]
*  Also in December, a 24-year-old man got nine months for having thrown an equipment container [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=434.84s)]
*  lid that beamed a cop, causing momentary loss of consciousness and a suspected concussion. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=438.86s)]
*  A 41-year-old man who wore body armor on January 6th pled guilty to scuffling with police, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  including trying to seize an officer's baton while shouting, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=449.36s)]
*  Come out here, B-word. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=452.56s)]
*  Other active cases include accusations of ramming the police line, punching cops and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=455.44s)]
*  walloping riot shields with a baseball bat. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=460.2s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial page continues, quote, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=463.24s)]
*  This was the brutal reality of the Capitol riot that many want to forget. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=466.8s)]
*  Hardening such crimes would contradict Mr. Trump's support for law and order, and it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=470.88s)]
*  would send an awful message about his view of the acceptability of political violence [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=476.84s)]
*  done on his behalf. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=481.86s)]
*  Now, as I mentioned, this is the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, deeply conservative. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=483.88s)]
*  I would take issue there with their characterization of Mr. Trump's support for law and order. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=489.04s)]
*  He has repeatedly praised the idea of violence in his name for every year that he has been [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=495.24s)]
*  in public life, and so I would take issue with that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=501.32s)]
*  That said, that last line I read there from the Wall Street Journal is absolutely correct. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=505.36s)]
*  Quote, It would send an awful message about Trump's view of the acceptability of political [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=509.0s)]
*  violence done on his behalf. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=514.48s)]
*  The acceptability of political violence done for him, in his name. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=518.38s)]
*  This January 6th, yes, we have got very blunt evidence of the profound difference between [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=523.12s)]
*  the Democratic Party offering Democratic competition, win or lose, and the Republican Party's threat [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=531.4799999999999s)]
*  of violence to hold power. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=537.8s)]
*  And yes, there is also the unnerving and occasionally unsettling fight to remember what actually [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=541.92s)]
*  happened, to be real about how disgusting it all was, while the Trump movement and the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=548.64s)]
*  Republican Party and the conservative media tries to say the January 6th attack was really [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=554.24s)]
*  just a bunch of heroes who were so peaceful and loving and they've just been wrongly [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=559.0s)]
*  persecuted for doing nothing wrong. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  The effort to remember and to stick to the truth of what happened there and not be gaslit [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=565.56s)]
*  and lied to that it was some sort of day of love and peace is unnerving and unsettling, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=571.8s)]
*  and yes, occasionally hilarious. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=577.7199999999999s)]
*  But there is also a very instrumental and practical question at hand this January 6th, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  which is what happens to the future of political violence in our country in the very short [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=588.8s)]
*  term, in like the next year, if the people who committed violence on Trump's behalf [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=594.4799999999999s)]
*  are sprung from prison by him and celebrated as vindicated heroes who did nothing wrong [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=599.64s)]
*  starting two weeks from today when Trump takes office again. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=605.84s)]
*  Think about this in big picture terms. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=610.84s)]
*  Why does a leader who celebrates violence against his critics and his enemies want not [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Spiv9qUVQ&t=613.6s)]
