# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w)
*  So officially this is the Tom Moreland interchange in Atlanta, Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=0.0s)]
*  But the locals call it Spaghetti Junction because it looks like an overturned bowl of spaghetti. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=4.64s)]
*  It's a five-level stack of intertwining interchanges where interstate 85 and interstate 285 intersect and go bananas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=9.84s)]
*  It is possible that the complexity of this intersection is about to be undone, or at least outdone, as the most complicated intersection in Atlanta. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=19.44s)]
*  Because tomorrow is due to be the first big pre-trial hearing in former President Trump's classified documents case in federal court. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=30.48s)]
*  We're expecting the judge in that federal case to set a schedule for that federal criminal trial, maybe tomorrow or sometime shortly thereafter. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=40.0s)]
*  On top of that though, today the Georgia State Supreme Court unanimously rejected an effort by Trump to get a Georgia prosecutor off his case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=49.12s)]
*  This is Georgia District Attorney Fannie Willis, who's been investigating efforts by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=58.16s)]
*  Last week, you may remember, she impaneled two grand juries. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=65.52s)]
*  One of those grand juries is expected to consider the historic question of whether to indict anyone in this case, including whether to indict Trump himself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=68.64s)]
*  Willis has all but made explicit that she anticipates announcing the grand jury's indictment decision sometime between the last day of this month, July 31st and August 18th. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=78.0s)]
*  These would be possible state-level charges, potentially serious ones. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=88.16s)]
*  But coming in from the southbound on-ramp could be federal special counsel Jack Smith with his own charges along the same lines. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=93.28s)]
*  Because in addition to bringing criminal charges against Trump in the classified documents case, a case for which we might get a trial scheduled tomorrow, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=102.24s)]
*  Jack Smith has also been running this other federal investigation into Trump's role in the January 6th attack and overturning the results of the election and the whole fake electors scheme, potentially even his fundraising off the fake stolen election claims. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  That part of Smith's investigation seems like it might overlap and crisscross with the state-level investigation of many of the same things that's happening in Atlanta. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=124.16s)]
*  And that raises interesting questions about timing. Georgia prosecutor Fonny Willis's indictment really may be imminent. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=135.6s)]
*  Legal experts say if there are federal charges on a similar matter, you would expect the federal court to take precedence. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=142.88s)]
*  But that's all going to come together very soon. So just in terms of timing, that may all come to a bumper car collision before we know it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=151.12s)]
*  And if that's not enough, if that has you feeling like all the Trump world investigations and indictments are tangled up with each other like somebody spilled the spaghetti, you're not wrong. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Because to add further complication, it now looks like there are two other states that have opened state-level criminal investigations into the fake electors part of the scheme, both in Michigan and in Arizona. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  If those result in charges, well, yeah, the calendar is going to get complicated here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  The calendar already is complicated if you are lawyering for Donald J. Trump. And God bless you if you are. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=187.84s)]
*  Each individual prosecutor can pursue their investigation at their own pace. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=194.88s)]
*  But once they decide to go to court, they are going to have to put on a blinker and merge with all the other prosecutors. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=198.88s)]
*  Spaghetti Junction just ahead. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=207.68s)]
*  So it was just a week ago, we covered Tennessee's Republican attorney general seizing the private medical records of trans people in that state. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=209.04s)]
*  Well, here's the lead in a breaking news story in the Tennessean newspaper tonight. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=218.32s)]
*  Tennessee's attorney general wants the state to be able to investigate and compel information on out-of-state abortions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=222.64s)]
*  These are your private medical records. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=230.16s)]
*  They are taking them already from trans people in Tennessee. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Now they want to take them from any Tennessee woman who has had an abortion in another state. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  In another state? Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=248.8s)]
*  If you live in Tennessee and you need to get an abortion, well, Republicans have instituted an abortion ban in Tennessee. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=250.24s)]
*  So you can't get one in Tennessee anymore. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=256.56s)]
*  You will need to travel out of state. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=258.64s)]
*  But Tennessee's Republican attorney general now says he intends to effectively follow you out of state to get your medical records to see if you got an abortion somewhere else, even in the state where it's legal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=260.79999999999995s)]
*  That's the Tennessean tonight. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  And oh, look, it's also in Kentucky. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  Tonight in the Louisville Courier Journal, the Kentucky attorney general wants Kentucky's out-of-state abortion records to be available to authorities. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=281.76s)]
*  Oh, it's not just Tennessee. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=291.6s)]
*  It's also Kentucky. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=294.24s)]
*  Oh, and look, here it is in Arkansas too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=295.36s)]
*  Today in the Arkansas Times, Arkansas attorney general wants to know about your out-of-state abortion. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=298.48s)]
*  It's happening with the Republican attorney general in Arkansas too. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=304.72s)]
*  Oh, and look here tonight. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=308.56s)]
*  Here it is in Georgia, Georgia attorney general. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=310.88s)]
*  And here it is in Mississippi, Mississippi's attorney general. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=314.4s)]
*  This is from Mississippi Today, a nonprofit news organization, which was actually first to break this story with this headline. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=318.4s)]
*  Mississippi's attorney general wants to make info on out-of-state abortions available to Mississippi authorities. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=325.2s)]
*  Mississippi has banned abortion. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=331.36s)]
*  There is no abortion clinic left in Mississippi. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=334.16s)]
*  So if you live in Mississippi and you need to get an abortion, you will need to figure out how to get yourself out of Mississippi and into a state where you can legally get one. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  But the Republicans in state government in Mississippi say they will effectively follow you out of the state. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  By virtue of the fact that you are a Mississippi resident, sorry, they now claim the right to seize your medical records from like a clinic in New York or in Illinois or wherever else you go. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=351.28s)]
*  They claim the right to follow you there and take your private medical records from there for their own law enforcement purposes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=363.84s)]
*  And I just showed you headlines from Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=372.56s)]
*  But it is actually 19 different states where Republican officials are going for this now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=378.4s)]
*  19 Republican attorney generals in 19 states have signed on to a letter to the Biden administration saying they want the right to go after women's private medical records anywhere in the country, including all the states where abortion is legal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=385.12s)]
*  They want to follow their residents all over the country to see if that woman might be getting an abortion or some other kind of reproductive care anywhere. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  They want the records and they claim the right to go get them. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=411.6s)]
*  Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  Republican attorneys general in all of those states have sent this letter to the Biden administration about their right as they see it to get your private medical records. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  And they mean it for women getting an abortion or potentially fertility treatment or any kind of reproductive care, potentially contraception. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=438.32s)]
*  And yes, also gender affirming care of any kind. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=448.0s)]
*  They claim the right to go take your private medical records to see what you're up to with that kind of care, no matter where you have gone to get it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=451.04s)]
*  How can you get away from something like this? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=461.68s)]
*  I mean, if this is what they say they want to do and it is, how do you get away from it? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=464.16s)]
*  The reason they've written to the Biden administration saying they claim this right is because the Biden administration says they should not have the right to do this. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=469.76s)]
*  The Biden administration is trying to assert federally that attorneys general from states where abortion is banned can't follow their residents to other state to see if they're getting banned care from someplace where it's legal. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  Beyond those those efforts to protect this at the federal level from the Biden administration, you've also started to see blue states, places like New York and Washington state that have also passed state laws saying that nobody should be able to get private medical records like this. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Just because you've banned abortion in your state doesn't mean you can effectively enforce it in mine. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=507.12s)]
*  But here's 19 Republican states, 19 Republican state attorney general saying they're going for it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=513.36s)]
*  And maybe they already are. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  When reporter Joe Sanka from the Louisville Courier Journal today asked the Kentucky attorney general's office if they have already pursued private medical records from Kentucky women who've had medical treatment in other states, the attorney general's office didn't give Joe Sanka an answer. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=522.48s)]
*  He says he has still not heard back from the attorney general's office about this, which leaves open the possibility that maybe they are already doing this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=538.24s)]
*  Maybe they are already trying or getting these medical records. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=545.5200000000001s)]
*  They used to say that the Republican Party was the party of of of limited government. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  This is a lot of things, but this is not that joining us now is many Timoraju. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  She's president of Neyral pro choice America. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=564.0s)]
*  And Miss Timoraju, it's really great to see you. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=566.24s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=567.7600000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=569.36s)]
*  So I want to start with this letter from these 19 Republican attorneys general. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=570.4s)]
*  They're writing writing to the Biden administration. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=577.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  Why have they said that? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=581.76s)]
*  Why have they taken this on as a matter that they need to take up with the federal government? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=583.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, the Republican AG's have been increasingly extremist. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=588.4s)]
*  They're some of the most egregious offenders of attacks of our fundamental freedoms from right from the freedom to vote to reproductive freedom. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=592.56s)]
*  It's not shocking that as they're losing the public opinion war on abortion, they're pivoting and trying to conflate a gender affirming care attacks with abortion care. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=599.2s)]
*  You know, we know that the opponents for reproductive freedom and abortion access are the same as the opponents of gender affirming care and the LGBTQ plus and trans communities. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=609.44s)]
*  We know this because we know where the dark money is coming from. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=619.84s)]
*  We know who the organizers are behind this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=622.72s)]
*  There's model legislation. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=625.7600000000001s)]
*  This all kind of started with SB 8 in Texas, actually my home state, which established this vigilante mechanism, right? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  And really encouraged citizens of the state to spy and report Texans who left the state to have abortions. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=634.08s)]
*  And when you have organized entities with extremist organizations like, you know, Heritage Society, Christian Right to Life, they are literally disseminating model legislation. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=641.44s)]
*  And tactics within the A.G.'s and between the legislature. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=654.8s)]
*  So it's not shocking. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=658.72s)]
*  Our sense of this is they're losing the public opinion war on abortion. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=660.8s)]
*  They are desperate to win back, win back power. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=666.56s)]
*  And in Mississippi, we know we have folks, the A.G. is currently out for reelection and she's going to be in a tough race. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=670.72s)]
*  So this is them fear mongering against some of the most vulnerable Americans to try to score points in their increasingly desperate base. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=677.36s)]
*  So we started covering this story when we learned about it in Tennessee, when families in Tennessee got notified by Vanderbilt University Medical Center that sort of much to their chagrin, the medical center felt compelled to hand over people's medical records when the attorney general demanded them. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=689.6s)]
*  Families didn't find out that the medical records had actually gone to the A.G.'s office until months after they'd already been handed over, which I think was very distressing to a lot of these families. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=706.8s)]
*  But it raises very practical questions immediately. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=715.84s)]
*  One is what can medical providers do to protect the privacy of their patients, both in Republican controlled states where there may be bans on the kinds of health care that we're talking about here, but also in blue states where these things are legal and people should be able to. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=718.72s)]
*  Obtain this kind of medical care without sort of without government intrusion. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=736.72s)]
*  But what can people themselves do to try to protect themselves if attorneys general in all of these states? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=740.48s)]
*  I mean, 19 states are saying they think that people's private medical information like this is fair game. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=745.92s)]
*  So I think you alluded to it before the Biden administration HHS proposed this rule in response to an active public comment period. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=751.84s)]
*  But also the White House, led by Vice President Harris and the Gender Policy Council, has done 40 plus meetings with abortion providers, activists, patients in tough states like Idaho and Missouri. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=762.96s)]
*  They've been soliciting feedback from legislators, A.G.'s. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=776.08s)]
*  They've known for a long time that this is what states were trying to do. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=780.0s)]
*  The reporting you gave, they've been tracking this, which is also why state the U.S. Senate last year, Catherine Cortez Masto, led by Catherine Cortez Masto. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=783.2s)]
*  Also tried to pass legislation that would protect providers and patients from crossing state lines. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, what can folks do in the states where these A.G.'s are threatening their bodily autonomy and their freedom? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=798.24s)]
*  They have to, frankly, the best choice is to fight back at the ballot box. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=804.72s)]
*  We have to get more activists about removing extremist A.G.'s. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, some of the most forward thinking attorneys general are now the governors in states that are doing the most advanced work on reproductive care. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=813.84s)]
*  You're talking about you're going to have Governor Shapiro on. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=822.4s)]
*  He's a former A.G., Maura Healey, former A.G. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=825.12s)]
*  I hate to make it political, but it is political. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=828.9599999999999s)]
*  We have to organize reproductive freedom voters. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=831.12s)]
*  To your point earlier in the show, Rachel, reproductive freedom voters have to become supporters of the broad range of freedoms for everybody, for our LGBTQ brothers and sisters. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=834.16s)]
*  The other course of action folks can take is to challenge these bills and these laws in the courts. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=845.28s)]
*  And a lot of our colleagues at ACLU, Center for Rupert Rights, are working on litigation. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  Manny Temirajou is president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  Ms. Temirajou, thanks very much for making time this evening. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=862.48s)]
*  This is a story that I think is going to get more attention in days ahead. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=865.28s)]
*  It's helpful to have you here. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=868.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=869.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=870.32s)]
*  I should say when, you know, when the Biden administration announced this rule to try to prevent, effectively, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=871.44s)]
*  Republican attorneys general and Republican controlled states from chasing their residents around the state going after their medical, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=879.52s)]
*  from chasing their residents around the country going after their medical records, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=885.84s)]
*  NARAL Pro-Choice America put out a statement saying, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=889.68s)]
*  your conversations with your doctor and your decisions about reproductive health care, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=891.92s)]
*  including abortion care, are your own business, no one else's. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=895.6s)]
*  And I remember when they put out that statement at the time, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=899.92s)]
*  I remember thinking at the time like, yes, yes, clearly that's the obvious bottom line from which we all proceed here. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=902.24s)]
*  It's not the obvious bottom line from which at least 19 Republican states are proceeding now. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=908.88s)]
*  It's incredible that this is contested ground, but boy is it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=914.7199999999999s)]
*  You might have seen there's this big New York Times story today, big story, very important story, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  about how the leading Republican presidential candidate, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=924.4s)]
*  Donald Trump, and Republicans more broadly, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=929.36s)]
*  have this plan that they want to put in place if the Republican party wins the presidency [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=932.56s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=938.4s)]
*  They're calling it Project 2025 because this is a plan that's supposed to go into effect [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=940.0s)]
*  upon the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2025. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  Either Trump or some other Republican president gets inaugurated in January of 2025, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=951.36s)]
*  and Project 2025 thereby goes into effect. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=956.4799999999999s)]
*  This plan is being coordinated by a right-wing think tank called the Heritage Foundation, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=960.24s)]
*  and it is a plan to radically change the form of governance that we have in the United States [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=965.28s)]
*  so as to concentrate all the power of the government in the hands of a single leader. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=973.36s)]
*  Our current executive branch was conceived of by liberals. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=979.68s)]
*  What's necessary is a complete system overhaul. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  What we're trying to do is identify the pockets of independence [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=988.16s)]
*  inside the U.S. government and seize them. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  Seize them so there won't be any more pockets of independent power outside the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=997.44s)]
*  pockets outside the power that is held by the president. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1002.32s)]
*  Now, as I said, they want this to be Donald Trump. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  They want him to be the guy in whose hands all this power is concentrated, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1009.2s)]
*  but they say they would plan to do this with any Republican president. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1013.84s)]
*  The plan is to change the structure of the U.S. government [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  so the next president, the next Republican president, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1020.48s)]
*  will take direct control of all state power. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  He would, for example, take over all federal law enforcement and run that directly for his [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1027.28s)]
*  own benefit through the DOJ. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1032.8s)]
*  There would be no more independence of federal law enforcement. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1034.32s)]
*  The next president would take control of private business in this country for his own benefit [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1038.08s)]
*  through the powers of the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1043.2s)]
*  The next president would revive an old and, I should say, illegal practice called impoundment, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1046.88s)]
*  which would basically take away the fundamental powers of Congress [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  and put that power, too, in Trump's hands. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1056.4s)]
*  Again, identify the pockets of independence and seize them. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1060.96s)]
*  So instead of checks and balances and limited government, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  we'd have more of a strongman system of government. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1067.52s)]
*  We'd have a single leader with all the power of the state personally arrogated to him. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1070.8s)]
*  No other part of the government, no other thing in the country at all, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1077.2s)]
*  would be allowed to constrain him. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1080.4s)]
*  That sounds nice. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1083.68s)]
*  It at least sounds simple. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1086.16s)]
*  That said, it is obviously fundamentally opposite to the whole idea of why we exist as a country [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1089.76s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1095.76s)]
*  And I think it's no surprise to see an article like this, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1097.6s)]
*  to see reporting like this in the Times today. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1101.84s)]
*  I think everybody sort of knows that this is where the American political right, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1103.68s)]
*  where the Republican Party has been heading in the Trump era. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1107.8400000000001s)]
*  But still, I think the reason this reporting today is getting so much attention [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1112.3200000000002s)]
*  and causing so much consternation [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1115.92s)]
*  is because, you know, however much this might be the dream of the Trump era right wing [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1119.3600000000001s)]
*  in American politics, for the most part, the American people really don't want this. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  And so it's one thing to like sort of see it hinted at or to feel like this is the kind of system [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1131.84s)]
*  they'd like to replace our system with. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1136.0s)]
*  It's another thing to see it in black letter print, right? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  To find out that they've put a name on it, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1143.12s)]
*  that it's a project that has an implementation date and they're getting it ready. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1145.6s)]
*  In general, by and large, the American people don't want to live [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1150.8799999999999s)]
*  under a single leader who has concentrated all power in his own hands [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  and nothing constrains him and nothing else matters other than his own whims and preferences [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1158.48s)]
*  and grudges. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1162.64s)]
*  You don't want to live in a country under a leader like that who's a good guy, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1163.84s)]
*  let alone a leader like that who's a bad guy. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1168.64s)]
*  You don't have to be a civics dork to know that you don't want that. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1172.72s)]
*  And I think by and large, the American people really don't. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1176.4s)]
*  you [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3-00M3X73w&t=1218.48s)]
