Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at examples of Donald Trump completely reversing a strongly stated opinion at a time that appears to coincide with a donation or other financial incentive, a situation that is not likely to change given Trump's transactional nature and his growing desperation for money.

# 'Everything's for sale': Trump's TikTok flip-flop follows disturbing pattern
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4)
*  Do you remember when the right wing freaked out about Bud Light? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, they really freaked out about Bud Light. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=4.0s)]
*  They were shooting Bud Light cans. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=7.0s)]
*  The right was very, very, very upset about Bud Light. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=9.0s)]
*  They were so mad. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=12.0s)]
*  In Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis got so excited about it, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=14.0s)]
*  he ordered an official Florida state investigation into Bud Light. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=18.0s)]
*  In Congress, House Republicans started their own [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=23.0s)]
*  federal congressional investigation of Bud Light. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=27.0s)]
*  They have spent the better part of the past year on this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=31.0s)]
*  No longer would everyone in the country see Bud Light as the beer [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=34.0s)]
*  that is slightly more flavorful than Coors Light, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=37.0s)]
*  but not quite as flavorful as Miller Light. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=40.0s)]
*  But the Bud Light blue is kind of a pretty color, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=42.0s)]
*  and sometimes it's on sale, so sometimes you buy it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=45.0s)]
*  even if you're not in love with it, because no one's really in love with it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=47.0s)]
*  And hey, if you're drinking light beer, no one expects to be in love with that stuff anyway. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=49.0s)]
*  I mean, that's how we all used to think of Bud Light, admit it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=53.0s)]
*  But after nearly a year of right-wing culture war, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=57.0s)]
*  no-holds-barred demagoguery against Bud Light, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=62.0s)]
*  no longer would any self-respecting right-winger, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=65.0s)]
*  would any self-respecting Republican buy Bud Light [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=69.0s)]
*  because it was on the end cap and came with a free koozie. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=72.0s)]
*  No, over the course of just under a year, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=74.0s)]
*  Bud Light was transformed from a normal American thing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=77.0s)]
*  you don't think much about into something very, very bad, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=81.0s)]
*  something they would shoot on sight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=84.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump, of course, jumped on board. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=88.0s)]
*  Money does talk. Anheuser-Busch now understands that, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=91.0s)]
*  he said, in a post promoting right-wing boycotts [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=96.0s)]
*  of companies that were seen to be liberal or liberal-seeming, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=99.0s)]
*  or maybe if you squinted, they might feel a little liberal, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=103.0s)]
*  but you're not sure why. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=106.0s)]
*  Bud Light, over the course of this past year, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=109.0s)]
*  became a conservative target, became a Trump-world boogeyman [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=111.0s)]
*  until Donald Trump did a total 180. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=116.0s)]
*  Out of the blue, he decided unilaterally to call off [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=120.0s)]
*  the right-wing Jeremiah against Bud Light. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=124.0s)]
*  He told all his followers to start drinking Bud Light again. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=127.0s)]
*  Quote, Anheuser-Busch is a great American brand [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=131.0s)]
*  that deserves a second chance. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=134.0s)]
*  Now, what caused this radical U-turn? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=137.0s)]
*  What caused the former president to turn on a dime like this? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=140.0s)]
*  The word dime is a help in this question, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=144.0s)]
*  because if you put that Trump post back up there, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=147.0s)]
*  the one where he says everybody should go back to drinking Bud Light, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=150.0s)]
*  look at the time and date stamp on that one. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=153.0s)]
*  Can we actually just make that part of it a little bigger? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=156.0s)]
*  You can see the stamp. Yeah, there we go. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=159.0s)]
*  All right, so keep that in mind. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=161.0s)]
*  3.30 p.m. on February 6. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=163.0s)]
*  Why is that when Trump did his 180-degree U-turn on Bud Light? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=165.0s)]
*  Well, hmm, look what happened that same day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=171.0s)]
*  Lobbyist for Anheuser-Busch announces $10,000 a plate fundraiser for Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=175.0s)]
*  So at 9.47 a.m., the lobbyist for Anheuser-Busch [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=181.0s)]
*  announces a $10,000 a plate fundraiser for Trump, 9.47 a.m. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=185.0s)]
*  That same day, at 3.30 p.m., [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=190.0s)]
*  Trump announces that he has changed his mind on Bud Light, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=193.0s)]
*  and conservatives should all drink Bud Light again. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=196.0s)]
*  That fundraiser was announced on February 6. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=200.0s)]
*  It was actually held last week, Wednesday last week, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=203.0s)]
*  but all Anheuser-Busch had to do was announce that they were going to do the fundraiser [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=206.0s)]
*  to get Trump to do what they wanted, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=209.0s)]
*  to get Trump to call off what had been a years-long conservative culture war top-line issue. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=212.0s)]
*  Would you like the head of the Republican Party [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=220.0s)]
*  and the Republican Party's next nominee to be President of the United States to do something for you? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=223.0s)]
*  Is there something you would like him to do for you or your company? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=228.0s)]
*  Perhaps you would consider opening your checkbook and swiveling your wrist. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=232.0s)]
*  Because that's apparently what it took to end the great right-wing Bud Light freakout of 2023 and 2024. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=236.0s)]
*  One fundraiser. That's how that one sort of ended in fiasco. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=244.0s)]
*  But now behold, here comes the same process again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=249.0s)]
*  Last week, end of last week, something happened in Washington that almost never happens anymore. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=253.0s)]
*  There was a vote in Congress. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=257.0s)]
*  This was an actual policy, and it's even on a somewhat controversial issue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=259.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, the vote on this bill last week in Congress was 50 to nothing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=265.0s)]
*  Now, this bill is on the issue of TikTok, social media app. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=271.0s)]
*  And whatever you think of TikTok, or whether you think of TikTok at all, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=277.0s)]
*  there have been bipartisan concerns that have been expressed for a long time [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=282.0s)]
*  that this very popular social media app could pose a national security threat in the United States [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=288.0s)]
*  because of links between the company that owns TikTok and the Chinese government. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=293.0s)]
*  I say there are widespread concerns about this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=298.0s)]
*  These have been manifest already in policy at lots of different levels. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=301.0s)]
*  Already, if you are a federal government employee or contractor, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=304.0s)]
*  if for work you have a phone or another device that belongs to the federal government, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=308.0s)]
*  the federal government says you are not allowed to install TikTok on that device. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=313.0s)]
*  In more than 30 states, there are similar bans on installing TikTok on any device [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=318.0s)]
*  that belongs to the state government. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=323.0s)]
*  This bill that's racing through Congress would require app stores to remove TikTok. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=325.0s)]
*  So you can't download the app anymore. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=331.0s)]
*  The only contingency would be if the company was sold to a firm [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=334.0s)]
*  that didn't have links to the Chinese government, that didn't have links to Beijing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=339.0s)]
*  Barring the company that runs TikTok being sold, TikTok would effectively be off the market. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=345.0s)]
*  When Trump was president in the summer of 2020, he tried to ban TikTok unilaterally himself. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=351.0s)]
*  He tried to force the company to be sold. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=358.0s)]
*  He issued an executive order banning any American citizen from having any transaction [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=361.0s)]
*  with the company that owns TikTok, which effectively would have banned the use of TikTok [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=366.0s)]
*  by anyone in the United States. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=370.0s)]
*  He tried that. He did that in the summer of 2020. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=372.0s)]
*  That executive order was eventually struck down by the courts, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=375.0s)]
*  which is why TikTok is not banned right now. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=378.0s)]
*  But Trump was very clear on this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=381.0s)]
*  He made a huge issue out of TikTok being evil and bad and dangerous and had to be stopped. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=383.0s)]
*  He was going to stop it. That was his stand. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=387.0s)]
*  Until. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=392.0s)]
*  Until something happened. Do we have that? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=394.0s)]
*  Do we have that cast register sound? Did you guys find it? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=397.0s)]
*  Oh, suddenly he's just made a total U-turn. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=404.0s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=407.0s)]
*  After personally trying to ban TikTok, after railing against it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=409.0s)]
*  and playing Mr. Tough Guy against TikTok for years now, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=413.0s)]
*  trying to shut down this app in the United States, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=416.0s)]
*  Trump has just come out and said, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=419.0s)]
*  actually, we shouldn't get rid of TikTok. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=422.0s)]
*  That would be terrible. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=425.0s)]
*  TikTok's actually got a lot going for it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=428.0s)]
*  He said so online on Thursday. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=430.0s)]
*  And now today he said it in an interview on CNBC. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=432.0s)]
*  There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=438.0s)]
*  There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=440.0s)]
*  There are a lot of users. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=445.0s)]
*  There's a lot of good. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=448.0s)]
*  It's a lot of good. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=452.0s)]
*  Really? All of a sudden, why the change? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=454.0s)]
*  Quote, some have noted that Trump recently hosted Jeff Yass [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=457.0s)]
*  at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=462.0s)]
*  Yass is a billionaire investor in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=464.0s)]
*  And Trump is seeking his support in the presidential race. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=468.0s)]
*  So follow the bouncing coin, if you will. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=473.0s)]
*  Step one, take very aggressive, very public position against foreign company. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=476.0s)]
*  Step two, notice nearby man who has a $33 billion, 15% stake in that company. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=481.0s)]
*  Step three, need money desperately. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=491.0s)]
*  Step four, announce news stance very much in favor of the same foreign company [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=494.0s)]
*  you used to oppose while blinking one's eyelashes at the man you just noticed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=498.0s)]
*  Step five, kaching, cash in. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=505.0s)]
*  If you would like the head of the Republican Party [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=511.0s)]
*  and the Republican Party's next nominee to be President of the United States [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=514.0s)]
*  to do something for you or your company, open checkbook swivel wrist. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=518.0s)]
*  Anything is possible. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=524.0s)]
*  And if you don't believe me, take it from Trump's own folks. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=527.0s)]
*  This is the headline in Newsweek right now. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=530.0s)]
*  Quote, Steve Bannon suggests Donald Trump has been bought. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=532.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon, former advisor to Donald Trump, suggested on Saturday [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=538.0s)]
*  that the former president was paid off after a shift in his stance on TikTok. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=541.0s)]
*  When even Steve Bannon is like, whoo, this guy appears to be for sale, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=547.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon right now has been sentenced to prison for a massive, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=551.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon has been sentenced to prison and is out of prison while his appeal is pending. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=555.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon has been put up on charges, had to be pardoned by Trump [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=564.0s)]
*  for an alleged massive fraud scheme. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=567.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon is going to be charged for that mass alleged massive fraud scheme [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=570.0s)]
*  in New York State Court. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=575.0s)]
*  And Steve Bannon is like, whoo, seems a little transactional. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=577.0s)]
*  I don't know. This guy appears to be for sale. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=581.0s)]
*  If Steve Bannon is saying you appear to be a little fraughty, a little for sale, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=585.0s)]
*  a little transactional, that means you have ceased to be subtle about it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=590.0s)]
*  There is a lot that is going on in Republican politics right now, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=595.0s)]
*  which is not the way things usually go in politics. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=598.0s)]
*  There's a lot of overlap between like, crime and politics. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=601.0s)]
*  Prison and politics. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=605.0s)]
*  But as Politico.com reports tonight on the, quote, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=608.0s)]
*  bloodbath at the RNC with Trump's people finally taking over as of this weekend [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=613.0s)]
*  and now as of today they are firing dozens of people who work at the Republican National Committee [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=619.0s)]
*  with confirmation that there is no longer even an effort to stop the National, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=623.0s)]
*  the Republican National Committee from paying Trump's personal legal expenses [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=628.0s)]
*  out of the Republican Party coffers. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=631.0s)]
*  We are in a place where the entire Republican Party apparatus is merging [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=634.0s)]
*  with Trump's personal legal defense apparatus. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=639.0s)]
*  And the way he has been behaving when it comes to being transactional [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=644.0s)]
*  at his time of most desperate financial need puts us, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=650.0s)]
*  no matter how you think of Trump, no matter whether you support him or not, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=655.0s)]
*  no matter whether you care about politics or not, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=658.0s)]
*  it puts us, the American people, in a radically fragile place [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=660.0s)]
*  when it comes to what exactly is for sale in our country and from our government. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=664.0s)]
*  I mean, Bud Light and TikTok seem to have figured out very early on [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=670.0s)]
*  where exactly you insert the coins to receive your prize. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=673.0s)]
*  But if anything is for sale, right, if everything is for sale, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=681.0s)]
*  what makes you think it's going to stop with thin beer and Chinese social media apps? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=686.0s)]
*  Everything must go. Everything's for sale. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=692.0s)]
*  Anybody who can pay can get what they want. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=697.0s)]
*  And you wonder why guys like this always want to undermine the rule of law, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=702.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymAZYz-6UL4&t=716.0s)]
