# 'Can't stand him': From policy to personnel, Trump scores historically low poll numbers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM)
*  The data is in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been a month officially, as of today, for this new presidential term. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=3.0s)]
*  And what the data says, sort of broadly, bottom line, is that the country kind of hates this [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  guy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't say hate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=16.28s)]
*  It's not the right word. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=18.12s)]
*  It's not a nice word. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=19.12s)]
*  Maybe it's can't stand him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=20.92s)]
*  Or maybe I shouldn't characterize it at all. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=24.6s)]
*  We'll just—I'll show you the numbers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=26.84s)]
*  I will say we probably should have seen this coming. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=28.48s)]
*  I didn't necessarily believe that it was coming this far, this fast. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  But you know, right out of the gate, Gallup did polling just after the inauguration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=36.72s)]
*  They did their first poll on public opinion of Trump in this second term, starting immediately [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=42.96s)]
*  after the inauguration. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=48.2s)]
*  Literally, they had their first poll in the field the first full day Trump was in office, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=49.2s)]
*  the day after he was sworn in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=53.52s)]
*  That is the definition of the honeymoon period, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  That's when you are at your high watermark in terms of what people are expecting from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=58.2s)]
*  you and hoping for from you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  But in that first Gallup poll of this presidential term, sort of shockingly, Trump was already [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=66.44s)]
*  underwater. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=72.64s)]
*  In his first week in office, more Americans disapproved of him than approved of him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=74.36s)]
*  I mean, only by one point, but still, that's unheard of. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=81.04s)]
*  That's a more than unusual thing in presidential polling. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=84.96s)]
*  Gallup, in fact, said at the time that in the 70 plus years they have been doing presidential [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=88.72s)]
*  polling, Donald Trump is the only president for whom his approval ratings were underwater [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  right at the start of his term in office, meaning more people disliked him than liked [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=99.8s)]
*  him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  So in that first week Gallup poll, Trump was underwater, 47 approving, 48% disapproving. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=106.0s)]
*  So that means he was coming in at at minus one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=113.16s)]
*  And like I said, that was something we haven't seen with any other president. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=117.32s)]
*  And to me, actually, it was shocking enough that I didn't think it would stand. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=121.8s)]
*  I thought that would be sort of an outlier. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=126.28s)]
*  But now look at this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=129.32s)]
*  Gallup just did its follow-up poll. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=130.92s)]
*  Now one month into Trump being back in office and his numbers have gotten worse. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=132.76s)]
*  He's not minus one anymore. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=138.28s)]
*  Now he's minus six, which makes him at this point in his term not only the most disliked [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=140.12s)]
*  and unpopular president in 70 plus years of Gallup polling, Gallup says it actually puts [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  him 15 points below the average polling for presidents, again, over the last 72 years [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=153.08s)]
*  in which they have been doing this polling. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=160.16s)]
*  At this point in a presidential term, one month in, the average is 15 points higher [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=162.52s)]
*  than where Trump is right now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=170.24s)]
*  Nobody has ever started off a presidential term this poorly in the eyes of the American [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=172.28s)]
*  people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=177.68s)]
*  I mean, all presidents are above water at this point in their presidencies right out [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=178.68s)]
*  of the gate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's the only one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=184.68s)]
*  Trump was underwater with the American public from day one. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=185.68s)]
*  And since then, he's been sinking like a cinder block in an ocean trench. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=188.64s)]
*  I did not know to expect that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=194.48s)]
*  And to be fair, part of the reason I'd expected that that Gallup number might go up and not [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  down is because Gallup's not the only game in town. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  There were other national well-regarded quality polls that came out right at the start of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=207.48s)]
*  did show him in positive territory, not big positive territory, but still positive. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=213.32s)]
*  Like for example, the Quinnipiac poll, which came out in late January, right after Trump [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=220.12s)]
*  was sworn in, it showed Trump doing okay. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=224.5s)]
*  I mean, not great, but in that poll, he was above water. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  He was plus three. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  But now, though, again, one month in, that same poll, Quinnipiac, oh, it's flipped. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=233.84s)]
*  He has gone from plus three in his first week in office to minus four now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=239.9s)]
*  That is a quick turnaround for a poll that initially looked okay for him less than a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=246.62s)]
*  month ago. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=251.62s)]
*  It looked okay for him. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=254.26s)]
*  Now it looks terrible for him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=255.26s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=256.38s)]
*  Well, it's because Trump's been doing stuff. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=257.38s)]
*  And what the data shows is that almost every single thing he has done is soundly and clearly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=260.52s)]
*  and in some cases wildly unpopular with the American people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=267.22s)]
*  Again, just look at that Quinnipiac poll that shows Trump underwater right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=272.38s)]
*  More Americans disapproving of him than approving of him, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  He was plus three right after he got sworn in. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  Now he's minus four. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=282.38s)]
*  You can see in the internals of that poll a little bit about what's driving that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=283.86s)]
*  Do you approve of Trump's handling of foreign policy? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=287.82s)]
*  No. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=291.26s)]
*  Do you approve of Trump's handling of trade? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=292.38s)]
*  No. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=295.86s)]
*  Do you approve of Trump's handling of the federal workforce? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=297.14s)]
*  No. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you approve of Trump's handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you approve of Trump's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=306.18s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  You approve of Trump's handling of the economy? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=311.74s)]
*  No. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=315.02s)]
*  No, the American public does not approve of his handling of the economy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=316.02s)]
*  And stick a pin in that one because that one's interesting for a number of reasons and we [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=319.53999999999996s)]
*  will come back to that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=322.74s)]
*  You take a look at the broad areas of responsibility a U.S. president has. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  And on all these broad points, the American public just says, no, Donald Trump, we do [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=329.74s)]
*  not like the way you are handling any of these issues. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=333.54s)]
*  And then when you drill down, not just to—you drill down from the broad categories of things [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=337.88s)]
*  to instead the stuff he wants you to focus on, the very specific things he's done, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  his signature specific issues and his signature gambits thus far since he's been in office, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=350.62s)]
*  the stuff that he thinks makes him look great. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=356.02s)]
*  Well, those things are even worse than the broad categories. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  On those things, the stuff he's doing is catastrophically unpopular. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=367.98s)]
*  This is from the same poll. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=368.98s)]
*  Do you like Donald Trump's genius idea for Gaza? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=370.06s)]
*  By a 40-point margin, the American people are against Trump on that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=373.06s)]
*  How about DEI, which they've tried to turn into a slur? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=378.58s)]
*  Do you think policies focused on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=382.06s)]
*  are a good thing? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=386.26s)]
*  The American people say, yes, actually. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=388.18s)]
*  Yes, actually, we do think that's a good thing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=390.18s)]
*  By a 15-point margin, Americans are for that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=392.62s)]
*  How about tariffs? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=397.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's favorite thing, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=398.5s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump's tariffs will help the U.S. economy or hurt it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=399.94s)]
*  By an 11-point margin, the American people say his tariffs will hurt the American economy, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=403.98s)]
*  not help. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=409.38s)]
*  How about Vladimir Putin? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=410.38s)]
*  All right, this is one of the most important things that Trump has done since being back [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=412.98s)]
*  in office. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=416.82s)]
*  You know, Trump's sitting there in the Oval Office telling reporters, yes, I trust Vladimir [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=417.82s)]
*  Putin as he throws out 70-plus years of our post-World War II alliances and decides that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=421.86s)]
*  now we're going to be allied against Europe and with Russia, all because he trusts Putin [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=428.62s)]
*  so much. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=433.82s)]
*  Well, Quinnipiac pulled on that specifically. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=434.82s)]
*  Quote, do you think the United States should trust Russian President Vladimir Putin or not? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=436.74s)]
*  Eighty-one percent of the American public says not. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=442.22s)]
*  Not. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=446.62s)]
*  But Trump does. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=448.62s)]
*  The same national polling shows the American public do not approve of Elon Musk. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=452.82s)]
*  Individually, Elon Musk's approval is minus 12. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=458.02s)]
*  But everybody else in his government is underwater. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=464.06s)]
*  The American public has apparently seen enough already to be against, to be disapproving, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=466.82s)]
*  more than approving, of not just Elon Musk by a mile, but Trump as well. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=471.42s)]
*  And also, JD Vance is underwater, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Brain Worm podcast guy [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=476.74s)]
*  who's now U.S. Health Secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, who really is the director of national [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=483.3s)]
*  intelligence, believe it or not, and Cash Patel, who was confirmed today as FBI director, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=487.7s)]
*  all of them are underwater in the new polling. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=492.26s)]
*  The American public does not like any of them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=496.02s)]
*  Not a single one of them is above water. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=499.5s)]
*  Nobody who they pulled on is above water in the Trump administration. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=501.34000000000003s)]

*  by the American people as a bad thing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=515.58s)]
*  2-to-1 against his prominent role in the administration. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=518.22s)]
*  In the New Washington Post poll, which we're going to talk about in a second, they've [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=521.74s)]
*  gotten Elon Musk's question as well. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=525.3s)]
*  Are you concerned about Elon Musk in his government role gaining access to your personal data [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=527.7s)]
*  and information? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=533.46s)]
*  The American people say, yes, yes, we are concerned about that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=535.14s)]
*  By a 29-point margin. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk being somehow empowered to shut down federal government programs, is that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=544.1s)]
*  a good thing or a bad thing? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=548.1s)]
*  By a 2-to-1 margin, the American people think that is a bad thing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=549.5s)]

*  Trump underwater by 8 points. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=571.9s)]
*  All of this absolutely historically unprecedented. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=574.38s)]
*  No president has ever come out of the gate with numbers like this ever before. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=577.26s)]
*  And it is across the board. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=581.98s)]
*  But you know, on that Washington Post one, look at this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=585.26s)]
*  Look deeper into that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=588.46s)]
*  They've got a minus 8. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=589.46s)]

*  But the base of fervent opposition to him is much larger, like 10 points larger. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=610.58s)]
*  The same poll also asks, do you want the next Congress, the Congress that's going [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=615.94s)]
*  to be elected next year in the midterms, do you want that Congress to be controlled [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=619.7s)]

*  By a 13-point margin, the country says, Democrats, please, we would prefer the Democrats [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=633.74s)]

*  the Capitol on January 6, 2021? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=664.42s)]
*  Do you support Trump's pardon of people convicted of violent crimes on J6? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=666.82s)]
*  What do you think the number is going to be on that one? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=670.0200000000001s)]

*  Americans who say that is 83%. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=677.22s)]
*  That was his first major act upon taking office as president. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=682.4200000000001s)]
*  83% of the public disagrees with it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=687.22s)]
*  That's a bad plan in politics. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=691.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CUFX9kUkM&t=721.22s)]
