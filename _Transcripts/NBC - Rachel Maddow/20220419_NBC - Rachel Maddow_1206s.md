# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ)
*  In 1936, 1937, 1938, Joseph Stalin decided he was going to consolidate his power, consolidate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  his hold on the Soviet Union by executing everybody he thought was in his way. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=7.24s)]
*  It's now known as the Great Purge or the Great Terror. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=13.32s)]
*  It wasn't just like Stalin eliminating other political elites he thought might be in line [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=16.92s)]
*  for his job. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=21.56s)]
*  Stalin ordered the killing of hundreds of thousands of people, by some estimates more [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=23.2s)]
*  than a million people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=27.48s)]
*  And thanks to the records historians started to get access to right after the collapse [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=30.32s)]
*  of the Soviet Union, in the mid to late 90s, historians were finally able to pinpoint a [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=34.6s)]
*  previously unknown site inside Russia, northern Russia, where as many as 9,000 people had [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=40.44s)]
*  been shot in the Great Purge and buried. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=46.96s)]
*  Just a huge site, an unmarked site with hundreds of burial pits, 236 different pits, and more [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  containing more than 9,000 bodies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=57.72s)]
*  They didn't find it until the summer of 1997. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=61.6s)]
*  And once they found it, they put up these stones, these markers, to commemorate it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=65.2s)]
*  They turned it into a memorial for the victims of Stalin. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=70.6s)]
*  They started to hold an annual day of remembrance there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=73.68s)]
*  After about 20 years though, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided that that was enough [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=79.14s)]
*  and he didn't want any more of that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=83.52s)]
*  Putin broadly decided that Stalin had gotten a bad rap. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=85.68s)]
*  The Soviet Union broadly got a bad rap. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=89.48s)]
*  Stalin in particular got a bad rap. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=91.4s)]
*  What benefit is there in all this supposed history, all these stories that make him seem [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=93.84s)]
*  like such a bad guy, that make the Soviet Union seem so flawed? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=97.92s)]
*  Let's restore the glory. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=101.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=102.92s)]
*  Sure, millions dead, but those people aren't around to tell their stories anymore. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=103.92s)]
*  So why should any of us tell that story, let alone hear it? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  And so, the historian who had first located that site in northern Russia, he was arrested. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=114.32s)]
*  They charged him with being a pedophile. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=121.8s)]
*  The Russian government then announced plans to bring bulldozers into that site. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=125.5s)]
*  They were going to dig up the bodies and show that this wasn't a mass burial site of Stalin's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=129.16s)]
*  victims. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=133.84s)]
*  This must have been something else entirely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=134.84s)]
*  The victims there must all have been Russians who were killed by foreigners. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=136.4s)]
*  Because of course, there was no gulag. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=140.6s)]
*  There was no great terror. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=142.28s)]
*  There was no great purge. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=143.38s)]
*  Stalin was a stand-up guy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=144.78s)]
*  Russia's history is pristine. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=146.42s)]
*  Anybody who says otherwise is obviously a degenerate, a monster. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=148.22s)]
*  After the historian who heroically tracked down the records and discovered that site, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=154.18s)]
*  after he was locked up and charged randomly with pedophilia, they did the same thing to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=159.78s)]
*  the head of the local museum, who had effectively been the on-site caretaker for the site once [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=165.18s)]
*  it was discovered. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=170.54s)]
*  He had also been vocal in his opposition to the Russian government coming in and digging [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=171.64s)]
*  it up with bulldozers. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  He too, they did the same thing to him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=177.32s)]
*  They arrested him and charged him with being a pedophile. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=179.83999999999997s)]
*  In both cases, the charges were widely believed to be trumped up and completely false, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  they were nevertheless loudly trumpeted on Russian state TV. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=188.72s)]
*  And the association they were trying to make was clear. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  You want to expose something about Russia's very dark past? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=196.64s)]
*  Well, obviously you're a degenerate and a monster. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=200.16s)]
*  Not even a regular criminal, not even a regular person who's just wrong, not even just a regular [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=203.28s)]
*  criminal, but a monster who must be destroyed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=208.84s)]
*  That local historian who ran the museum near the burial site, he was like the de facto [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=214.72s)]
*  caretaker for the burial site, he spoke out against bulldozing it, it was widely understood [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=218.5s)]
*  that the allegations against him were ridiculous and completely false. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=224.76s)]
*  They did their job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=229.7s)]
*  They got, they served as a pretext for locking him up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=230.7s)]
*  He ended up dying in prison. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=233.78s)]
*  Never saw freedom again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=237.22s)]
*  With those guys out of the way, the Russian government has taken down the memorial at [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=240.82s)]
*  the site. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=244.74s)]
*  They've re-designated the whole burial site as a sightseeing locale. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=245.74s)]
*  Used to be a heritage site because of the mass murder that happened there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=249.42s)]
*  They've re-designated it now as a national sightseeing locale. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=253.9s)]
*  Yeah, what a nice forest. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=257.82s)]
*  What a great spot for a picnic. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=259.58s)]
*  What are all these big square pits? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=260.94s)]
*  Before he became what he is now, which is basically dictator for life, in the late 90s, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=266.46s)]
*  Vladimir Putin was head of the FSB. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=272.1s)]
*  He was head of the FSB when Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia in the late 90s. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=275.78s)]
*  And Yeltsin, like lots of Russian leaders, had a corruption problem. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=280.94s)]
*  More specifically, the problem Yeltsin had in 1997 was that there was a prosecutor in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=284.32s)]
*  Russia who was investigating corruption at the highest levels in the Kremlin, including [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=289.62s)]
*  Yeltsin and his family. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=294.02s)]
*  And for a time, it seemed like that corruption investigation might be the undoing of Yeltsin [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=295.74s)]
*  and his family and his cronies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=300.62s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, as head of the FSB, took care of that problem for Boris Yeltsin. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=303.92s)]
*  Putin arranged for a video to be broadcast on national television that showed the prosecutor [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=309.16s)]
*  or somebody who maybe kind of looked like the prosecutor in bed with not one but two [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  young, very young females. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=322.04s)]
*  The video was low enough quality and it was shot from sort of oblique enough angles that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  you couldn't necessarily tell with the naked eye who this grown man was with these girls [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=330.12s)]
*  in this bed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=335.22s)]
*  But Putin stepped up. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=337.3s)]
*  In his authority as head of the FSB, Vladimir Putin assured the Russian public that he could [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=338.54s)]
*  guarantee that the man in the video was, in fact, that prosecutor. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=344.78000000000003s)]
*  And so that was the end of that prosecutor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=351.2s)]
*  And that was the end of the corruption investigation into Boris Yeltsin and his family. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=353.5s)]
*  And in gratitude, or at least in payback, Boris Yeltsin decided that he would name, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=357.88s)]
*  as the next prime minister of Russia and then the next president of Russia, that FSB guy [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=362.44s)]
*  who helped him out, Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=367.02s)]
*  That's how Vladimir Putin rose to power in the first place in Russia. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=371.17999999999995s)]
*  That's how he got control of the Russian government by generating, effectively, a false [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  pedophilia claim against just the right guy at just the right moment. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=380.85999999999996s)]
*  That's how he got into power. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=385.26s)]
*  Pedophilia, of course, is the most repulsive of all human behavior. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=388.26s)]
*  It is so repulsive. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=395.3s)]
*  It is so evil that it makes us see red. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=397.32s)]
*  It is almost literally unthinkable. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  And it therefore, understandably, can make us stop seeing anybody who's even accused [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=406.12s)]
*  of it as our fellow human. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  Anybody abetting it or even abiding it, it's basically the same thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=416.68s)]
*  Your brain just instantly goes to monster, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=420.2s)]
*  Understandably, as it is the most repulsive of all human evil. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=425.28s)]
*  And when confronted with it, we almost can't process it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=432.7s)]
*  And it is a deep dark thing to recognize that about human nature, right? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  The capacity of some people for that behavior, for that level of evil, and our collective [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  massive human revulsion and rejection of that evil. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=447.21999999999997s)]
*  But recognizing that, to decide that you're going to try to harness that for political [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=453.2s)]
*  gain, that you're going to make false accusations of that kind systematically to reduce your [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=459.92s)]
*  political opponents to non-human status, that is a horrific abuse of its own. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=466.48s)]
*  And it has become one of the hallmarks of modern authoritarianism, not only in Russia, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  but especially in Russia under Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=478.86s)]
*  It's an obvious and frequent enough political tactic in Putin's Russia that in 2016, not [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  long after our bizarre 2016 presidential election, the New York Times ran a feature on how this [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  particular tactic kept coming up increasingly in Putin's Russia. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=495.88s)]
*  You see the headline there. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=499.68s)]
*  Foe's of Russia say child pornography is planted to ruin them. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=500.68s)]
*  It's so evil. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=505.66s)]
*  It's so like meta level exploitative and evil and base and cynical. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=508.66s)]
*  But of course they use it, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=514.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been in power 22 years now in Russia. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=518.64s)]
*  And that particularly sick hallmark of his time in power has been a constant. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=522.9s)]
*  He has used it against all different kinds of political opponents. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=528.96s)]
*  And it always works. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=531.96s)]
*  During the Trump years here, we started to get the conspiracy theory cult version of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=536.08s)]
*  it on the political right here in America. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=542.14s)]
*  The QAnon pro-Trump online cult built its whole bizarre central conspiracy theory around [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=546.0400000000001s)]
*  these same kinds of false and fantastical claims that everybody in the world who isn't [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=552.5s)]
*  Trump is allied in some big satanic pedophilia ring. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=557.6600000000001s)]
*  And someday Trump will catch them all and bring on mass public executions of all the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=561.72s)]
*  Democrats and all the celebrities and then finally will be free from the satanic pedophile [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=566.5s)]
*  conspiracy that runs the world. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  That's the basic idea of the bizarre pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory cult. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=573.72s)]
*  And on the one hand, it is freakish, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  It is truly bizarre. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=582.64s)]
*  It is a conspiracy theory cult. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=584.48s)]
*  And you have to be like an extremism anthropologist to understand any of it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=586.28s)]
*  On the other hand, it's been remarkably persistent during the Trump era in American conservative [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=591.28s)]
*  politics. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=596.72s)]
*  And it does have this clear political point, which is why authoritarian movements and dictators [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=598.64s)]
*  do some version of this all over the world. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=604.16s)]
*  It's what some political scientists call eliminationist rhetoric. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  It's one thing for you to be competing in a democracy against your political opponents, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=614.18s)]
*  against fellow human beings who have different ideas about governing and may the best candidate [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  win. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=623.4s)]
*  It's another thing if everybody on the other side of you in politics is inhuman, is a monster, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=624.4s)]
*  a beast who you have to protect children from and who must be eliminated if we are ever [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=630.4s)]
*  to have any sort of civilization. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=637.64s)]
*  You don't compete against a monster in an election. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=640.36s)]
*  You destroy them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=644.78s)]
*  You call for their public execution. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  And when it comes to power, the idea that you'd let one of these monsters have power [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=648.42s)]
*  because of something as small and pointless and beside the point as them winning an election, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=653.06s)]
*  well, that's unthinkable. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  The election is much less important than keeping the monsters at bay. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=657.9799999999999s)]
*  Eliminationist rhetoric. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=664.06s)]
*  Playing with these kinds of false accusations, this kind of false accusation in particular, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=667.42s)]
*  It is lurid and disgusting and shocking and bizarre, but it is also playing with the worst [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=671.9s)]
*  kind of fire in terms of what we are capable of in our understandable human nature. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=680.5799999999999s)]
*  Because for people who believe these kinds of false allegations, even for people who [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=688.1s)]
*  don't necessarily believe them explicitly, but they ambiently absorb that these are the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=693.86s)]
*  kinds of accusations that are circulating out there about people in politics. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=698.14s)]
*  I mean, that can be used to justify almost any level of extreme response, any level of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=702.42s)]
*  violence even in response. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=707.02s)]
*  That's why it's a dictator's tactic. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=710.6999999999999s)]
*  That is why it is a fascist authoritarian tactic. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=713.26s)]
*  There's a website out there that you might have come across called bidennoms.com. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=718.18s)]
*  When I first found out there was this Biden Noms website, I of course thought it was about [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=722.78s)]
*  the snacks that President Biden is nomming on. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=727.74s)]
*  It was like an ice cream tribute site. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=730.1s)]
*  But it's actually bidennoms.com is about Biden nominees for government posts. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  It's the website of a right-wing group called the American Accountability Foundation. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=738.82s)]
*  And it's not shy about what the group is setting out to do. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=743.9s)]
*  They say at bidennoms.com, quote, personnel is policy. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=747.38s)]
*  We are working to ensure that leaders within the federal government reflect the values [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=750.72s)]
*  and concerns of the American people, not the liberal coastal elites and their woke allies [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=753.86s)]
*  in corporate America. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=758.74s)]
*  And then just like they're sort of hunting trophies, the site has headshot after headshot [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=761.9s)]
*  of headshot after headshot of Biden nominees. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=766.26s)]
*  Some of them famous ones for sure, but some of them you've definitely never heard of. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=769.54s)]
*  The thing that's unique about this group is that they're not sort of trying to keep one [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=773.42s)]
*  person who they don't like or two people who they don't like out of the job. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=778.74s)]
*  They're trying to keep every single Biden nominee out of the job, or at least to dirty them [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=781.9000000000001s)]
*  all up along the way. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=786.3000000000001s)]
*  Everybody Biden nominated who's going through the confirmation process, they're going after [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  them simply because Biden nominated them, all of them. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=792.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, opposition research isn't new. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=797.0600000000001s)]
*  It's a sort of gross part of how Washington operates, but it has always been thus. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=799.22s)]
*  This group, though, is different. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=804.1800000000001s)]
*  An investigative reporter, Jane Mayer at The New Yorker, has been busy sort of finding them out. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=805.38s)]
*  Quote, the American Accountability Foundation's approach represents a new escalation in partisan [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=810.62s)]
*  warfare. Rather than attack a single candidate or nominee, the group aims to thwart the entire [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=817.78s)]
*  Biden slate, meaning every Biden nominee full stop. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=823.26s)]
*  They claim to have successfully derailed nominations like Biden's nominee for Comptroller of the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=827.5s)]
*  Currency by ginning up a fake narrative that she was somehow a communist, an actual communist. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=831.78s)]
*  Also the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin for position at the Federal Reserve Board. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=838.14s)]
*  They claimed falsely that a delay in her disclosure of a stock trade was because she had somehow [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=842.34s)]
*  abused her position as a previous government government employee to obtain some sort of secret [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=848.9s)]
*  financial benefit for herself. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=854.74s)]
*  It was completely false. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=857.0600000000001s)]
*  There's mudslinging. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=859.5400000000001s)]
*  But then there's this. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=861.3000000000001s)]
*  What's different about this is the wholesale approach to every nominee of the Biden [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=863.4599999999999s)]
*  administration and the willingness to levy these attacks, not only sort of separate from the facts, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  but separate in many cases from common decency at a wholesale level. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=875.54s)]
*  Joining us now is Jane Mayer. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=879.9799999999999s)]
*  She's chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=881.06s)]
*  She's also the author of Dark Money, the hidden history of the billionaires behind the rise of the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=883.14s)]
*  radical right. Ms. Mayer, it's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for making time. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=893.14s)]
*  And that was a fantastic introduction. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=893.86s)]
*  I had never heard the phrase eliminationist rhetoric before, but it's perfect in describing [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=896.0600000000001s)]
*  what this group tries to do. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=902.74s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=905.3000000000001s)]
*  That's nice to say. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=906.46s)]
*  But I mean, when I was watching the Judge Jackson confirmation hearings and Senator Hawley [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=907.4200000000001s)]
*  and Senator Blackburn and conservative media started going down this line with her, it was [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=915.26s)]
*  shocking because the allegation they were making against her saying that she was, you know, soft on [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=921.06s)]
*  sexual abuse of children was so divorced from the facts and felt so wrong. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=927.06s)]
*  But it also does dovetail with these other political tactics that we see in dictatorships and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=932.66s)]
*  that we sort of started to see in the Trump era, the Republican Party. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=937.14s)]
*  And it really had me wondering who cooked this up because I didn't think Josh Hawley made it up [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=939.6999999999999s)]
*  himself. Seems like you've discovered that this group was the origin story for that false attack. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=943.54s)]
*  Yeah, Hawley had some little helping hands. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=950.58s)]
*  And it was this group, the American Accountability Foundation, which, believe it or not, is a tax [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=954.34s)]
*  exempt organization. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=962.1s)]
*  You can give money to it and get a tax deduction while it smears everybody in sight. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=964.0200000000001s)]
*  And it does, you know, sort of phony research, basically, and a pretty sloppy job if you [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=970.26s)]
*  really look into it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=977.7800000000001s)]
*  Most of the mud that it's slunk has dissolved when you take a really close look. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=979.18s)]
*  But the problem is, for a lot of the lesser known nominees, people aren't really looking very [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=985.18s)]
*  carefully. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=989.9s)]
*  What caught my eye about it was that I was writing a little bit about the nomination of Sarah Blum [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=991.5799999999999s)]
*  Raskin to become the vice chairman of the Fed for supervision. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=997.3399999999999s)]
*  She's incredibly well qualified. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1002.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, and very well liked by the banking world also and had been confirmed twice before to very [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1005.58s)]
*  senior positions at the Fed and at the Treasury Department with bipartisan unanimous support. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1015.02s)]
*  And suddenly there were these allegations that were pre-taxed, basically, that had nothing to do [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1021.42s)]
*  with reality, that was kind of a made up story claiming that she had an ethical problem. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1026.86s)]
*  And they didn't really go after her for what I think is the real beef that they had with her, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1033.5s)]
*  which was that she had said a few things about climate change and how it posed a risk to the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1039.3400000000001s)]
*  economy. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1043.9s)]
*  So I started looking at this group trying to figure out who are these people. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1044.78s)]
*  And of course, it turned out that a lot of the senators were getting their research from this [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1048.46s)]
*  group and the senators were getting their money from the fossil fuel industry. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1052.6200000000001s)]
*  And they needed a pre-tax to take her down in order to stop the Fed from including climate [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1056.3000000000002s)]
*  change as one of the things that it might consider as an important economic risk. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1062.46s)]
*  So anyway, I started trying to find out who these people were. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1067.74s)]
*  You also write about the expensive lengths to which this group appears to have gone [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1073.8200000000002s)]
*  to come up with these smears for some other nominees, including a woman who was put forward [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd-PkC5HyfQ&t=1079.3400000000001s)]
