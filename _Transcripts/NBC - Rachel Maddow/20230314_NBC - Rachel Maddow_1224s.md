# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 13
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50)
*  Chances are you've heard of an American author named Jodi Pico. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=0.0s)]
*  Perhaps you've read one of her books or a bunch of them. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=5.0s)]
*  There's a whole bunch. She's published nearly 30 books. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=7.0s)]
*  She's sold tens of millions of books. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=9.0s)]
*  She's a New York Times bestselling author many times over. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=11.0s)]
*  She's huge. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=14.0s)]
*  And a few days ago, Jodi Pico was shocked to learn that one of her books has now been banned. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=15.0s)]
*  The book is called The Storyteller. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=20.0s)]
*  It's a book about the Holocaust. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=22.0s)]
*  And a county in Florida has now banned it from its school libraries under Republican Governor Ron DeSantis' broad, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=24.0s)]
*  vague new laws covering what kids can and cannot read. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=32.0s)]
*  Jodi Pico responded with this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=37.0s)]
*  She said, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=39.0s)]
*  The Storyteller is a novel about the Holocaust. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=40.0s)]
*  It chronicles the growth of anti-Semitism and fascism in Nazi Germany. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=42.0s)]
*  It was a strange irony that a parent wanted this particular book removed because it felt a bit like history repeating itself. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=46.0s)]
*  That feeling, that stuff we thought maybe we had left behind is rearing its head again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=54.0s)]
*  That feeling is happening a lot these days. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=60.0s)]
*  Last week, House Republicans held a hearing supposedly on the origins of COVID-19. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=63.0s)]
*  They invited as their expert witness this guy, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=70.0s)]
*  famous for writing a book that claims, among other things, that Jewish people are genetically evolved. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=73.0s)]
*  They are biologically programmed to love money. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=79.0s)]
*  That was their expert who they brought in on the science of COVID. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=84.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, here's a picture of former President Trump's adult son, Eric. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=89.0s)]
*  He's the one on the left, the blonde one there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=94.0s)]
*  Here he is hanging out with the guy who he's now traveling the country with. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=96.0s)]
*  The guy on his left, our right, is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist who says the Jews did 9-11 [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=100.0s)]
*  and that Hitler was fighting, quote, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=107.0s)]
*  the same people that we're trying to take down today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=109.0s)]
*  Eric Trump and this Jews did 9-11 guy are traveling the country now as part of something called the Reawaken America Tour. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=114.0s)]
*  In May, that roadshow will be taking over one of Donald Trump's Florida properties for a weekend. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=122.0s)]
*  This weekend in Florida, police issued citations to five men for dumping hundreds of anti-Semitic Neo-Nazi flyers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=129.0s)]
*  around a neighborhood in West Palm Beach. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=136.0s)]
*  The men were not arrested. They were ticketed for littering. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=139.0s)]
*  NPR this weekend just reported on a group of self-described Nazis who have been projecting giant five-story tall swastikas [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=143.0s)]
*  and other anti-Semitic imagery on tall buildings in the city of Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=151.0s)]
*  And then there was Ohio this weekend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=157.0s)]
*  Right-wing extremists, white supremacist groups have lately been targeting drag queen story hours. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=159.0s)]
*  But what happened in Ohio this weekend was a different order of magnitude. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=166.0s)]
*  One drag queen storytelling event in a park in the town of Wadsworth, Ohio drew hundreds of protesters, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=170.0s)]
*  including lots and lots of full-on Neo-Nazis, many of them armed, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=177.0s)]
*  lots of them carrying swastika flags and shouting, Sig Heil. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=183.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you a little bit of footage that we've obtained from the event, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=188.0s)]
*  just a little bit because I don't really want to give these guys the publicity they crave. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=191.0s)]
*  But I do want to show you just a few seconds so you can get a sense of how unnerving this must have been for that community. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=194.0s)]
*  Probably goes without saying, you may find this footage upsetting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=200.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=205.0s)]
*  Sig Heil! Sig Heil! Sig Heil! [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=208.0s)]
*  Weimar conditions! Weimar conditions! [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=213.0s)]
*  Sig Heil! Sig Heil! [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=216.0s)]
*  So they're doing Sig Heil, Sig Heil, and you hear them saying Weimar conditions, Weimar solutions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=220.0s)]
*  They're talking about Hitler, right? Hitler overthrew the Weimar Republic. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=225.0s)]
*  Y'all know what Hitler's solution was. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=229.0s)]
*  Again, these guys are out in numbers and in force screaming at Ohio kids this weekend. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=233.0s)]
*  We've got some folks on the right trying to ban books about the rise of Nazism and the rise of anti-Semitism in 1930s Germany, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=240.0s)]
*  while others are literally trying to make it happen all over again. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=248.0s)]
*  Guy Cecil is one of the party's biggest thinkers in terms of democratic strategy, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=255.0s)]
*  in terms of what Democrats should be doing to counter Republican electoral machinations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=259.0s)]
*  And now he is leaving that job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=264.0s)]
*  He's announced that he is leaving Priorities USA at the end of this month after eight years in that landmark very important job, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=266.0s)]
*  which made me want to grab him tonight for something I hope I can sneak in as a kind of exit interview without letting him know that's what I'm doing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=273.0s)]
*  As he joins us here now on set for his first TV interview since the announcement, Mr. Cecil, it's nice to see you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=280.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=286.0s)]
*  After all that, I maybe should stay. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=287.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, here's the thing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=289.0s)]
*  You're not a household name in every household, but for political junkies and people who know how the Democratic Party works, you're a big deal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=292.0s)]
*  So first of all, I have to ask you, are you leaving for some intriguing reason? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=298.0s)]
*  Is there something terribly wrong? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=301.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=302.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=303.0s)]
*  Nothing wrong. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=304.0s)]
*  You're leaving because you want to do something different. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=305.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I never imagined in 2015 that I would be here eight years later. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=307.0s)]
*  At the time, we were a traditional super PAC. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=313.0s)]
*  We ran ads and we existed every four years to do that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=315.0s)]
*  And after 16, we realized this is not the way we win, that Republicans invest in the long term. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=319.0s)]
*  They invest in the federalist societies. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=327.0s)]
*  They invest in institutions that aren't just about one issue or about one candidate, but about making long term ideological change. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=329.0s)]
*  And so we thought, hey, we have this opportunity. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=338.0s)]
*  We have this vehicle. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=341.0s)]
*  So let's identify a couple of the structural gaps we see now and let us help the Democratic Party and the progressive left fill some of those gaps. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=342.0s)]
*  And we're doing that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=351.0s)]
*  And we have had the same leadership team now for six years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=353.0s)]
*  I get to come on shows and talk about our great work. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=356.0s)]
*  But the reality is we have a team led by our executive director, Danielle Butterfield, who they're going to continue doing this work. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=359.0s)]
*  How do we close the digital divide between the left and the right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=366.0s)]
*  How do we counter algorithms that reward hatred and right wing ideology? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=369.0s)]
*  How do we make sure we're fighting not just against voter suppression through litigation, but voter suppression through misinformation? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=375.0s)]
*  All of those things are going to continue. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=382.0s)]
*  But I also think organizations benefit from change. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=385.0s)]
*  They benefit from new leadership and fresh thinking. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=388.0s)]
*  And I think it's also important for leaders of those organizations every once in a while to take a step back, to remove themselves from the minute by minute. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=391.0s)]
*  Work and to ask themselves, what am I now called to do? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=398.0s)]
*  And for me, knowing the organization was going to be in good shape, having a lot of trust in our leadership, I thought now was the right time to take a step back and to take another look at what's happening in our country and how I can best serve. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=402.0s)]
*  So at this inflection point that you're making for all those reasons, which I trust you in terms of explaining those things, I'm not looking for further intrigue. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=416.0s)]
*  But at this inflection point, where do you feel like the Democratic Party has ground that it can reasonably make up? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=425.0s)]
*  Not just places where the Democratic Party is behind, but places where the Democratic Party can do it, can catch up to the Republicans on some of these sort of structural long term projects that, for example, the Federalist Society and other groups on the right have had an advantage. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=432.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that's a great place to start. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=447.0s)]
*  They are now out in the open about what their intentions are. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=449.0s)]
*  There are billions of, yeah, and they're a larger cohort of leaders, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=452.0s)]
*  There's over $1.4 billion being invested in essentially creating Federalist societies that aren't just focused on the courts, but are focused on Silicon Valley, are focused on education, are focused on technology. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=457.0s)]
*  We are not prepared to combat that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=469.0s)]
*  And we're not prepared to go on the offensive because so much of our infrastructure is based on an issue or a candidate. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=472.0s)]
*  Climate is my number one issue. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=478.0s)]
*  Criminal justice is my number one issue. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=480.0s)]
*  I liked Barack Obama, but I wasn't sure about Hillary Clinton. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=482.0s)]
*  Not enough of our focus is on how do we make sure that we are laying the ideological ground through all of the various levers, Silicon Valley, entertainment, education, to win. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=486.0s)]
*  The second, I think, is more of an internal look at how we communicate. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=496.0s)]
*  Our party is diverse and we're unwieldy. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=501.0s)]
*  But part of that comes because we are much more diverse than the Republican Party. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=505.0s)]
*  There are more backgrounds. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=510.0s)]
*  There are a lot of issues that we care passionately about. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=512.0s)]
*  And one of my concerns is that we have fetishized the use of data and analytics. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=515.0s)]
*  We think that there is a magic word or issue. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=519.0s)]
*  And we create caricatures out of our voters. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=523.0s)]
*  And what I think that does is make it more difficult for us to communicate across the diversity of our party. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=526.0s)]
*  Black voters care about criminal justice reform, no doubt. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=532.0s)]
*  They also care about good paying jobs, health care, and education in the same way that Latino families and Asian families and gay families and white families do. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=535.0s)]
*  But we're not communicating in that way. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=544.0s)]
*  We are turning our voters into a confederacy of caricatures instead of presenting a broader image about what we want the country to be. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=546.0s)]
*  The other thing that the structural approach that you're describing on the right, though, the other thing they've done is the sort of personnel as policy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=555.0s)]
*  Which is to make sure that in every influential institution and every feeder institution that leads to those institutions, you've got ideologically committed people who, over the course of their entire career, are going to be, have set a set a bead on achieving the ideological goals of the movement. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=561.0s)]
*  The right thinks the left does that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=581.0s)]
*  The left does not do that. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=583.0s)]
*  And that sort of work is the sort of thing that you have to plan literally a generation ahead for. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=585.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=590.0s)]
*  I think there's two things that are really important. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=591.0s)]
*  Number one, there's a mythology that we're the party of big government, Republicans are the party of small, limited government. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=593.0s)]
*  That is actually not true. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=600.0s)]
*  Republicans are the party of limited government when it comes to helping the middle class, preserving, you know, our ability to take care of the poor, making sure that Social Security is in place. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=602.0s)]
*  And all of those instances, they want a very limited small government. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=611.0s)]
*  But they want a large activist government when it comes to litigating my marriage to my husband, controlling the uterus of American women, protecting the right of domestic abusers to have access to guns. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=614.0s)]
*  I feel like we need to change the narrative a bit on how we view the Republican Party. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=625.0s)]
*  The entire evangelical movement. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=631.0s)]
*  I used to be a Baptist minister before I got into politics. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=633.0s)]
*  The entire evangelical conservative movement sold their soul for one issue and they apologized for Donald Trump for six years and continue to do so because they had their eye on the long term ball, which was destroying Roe v. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=637.0s)]
*  Wade, nationalizing a ban on abortion. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=650.0s)]
*  We need to think more long term about how we are going to engage at every level of the ballot and across all of these different spheres of influence. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=653.0s)]
*  Because the reality is most Americans agree with us on most issues. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=661.0s)]
*  So we have to ask ourselves, whose fault is it that we're not effectively communicating those things? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=666.0s)]
*  And I don't want to overstate the problem. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=671.0s)]
*  We have a Democratic president. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=673.0s)]
*  We have a Democratic Senate. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=674.0s)]
*  It's easy for them. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=675.0s)]
*  You know, our love language is anxiety in the Democratic Party. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=676.0s)]
*  But I do think it's important for us just to take a step back and say, OK, what can we do better? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=680.0s)]
*  Because we really are trying to make our country fairer and more prosperous and more just. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=686.0s)]
*  And now our job is to do the hard work to make that to make that happen. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=691.0s)]
*  Guy Cecil, who for the last eight years was chairman of Priorities USA, who has done way more than you think to shape what you have ever heard from any Democratic Party or cause. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=694.0s)]
*  Guy, good luck to you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=703.0s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=705.0s)]
*  The type of stress that this bank was just subjected to is the type of stress they were supposed to be tested against had they not lobbied hard for themselves to be exempted from the new regulations that were otherwise put in place after the last crash to stop this from happening. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=707.0s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren was right when she said what rolling back those regulations would do in 2018. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=725.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Senate Banking Committee. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=731.0s)]
*  Senator, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. Thank you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=736.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=740.0s)]
*  So you understand these things well. I really don't. I don't have a head for this stuff. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=741.0s)]
*  I'm not a person who's financially minded at all. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=746.0s)]
*  Let me just first start by asking you if I've missed out anything important or if I've explained this in a way that comports with your understanding. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=749.0s)]
*  Nope. You got it basically right that the way to understand this crisis is it's really got kind of three players in it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=757.0s)]
*  The first is Congress and President Trump, who said, let's weaken the regulation, which you've hit really hard. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=765.0s)]
*  The second part is the regulators themselves, in particular the Fed, in particular Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, who took that change in the laws. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=773.0s)]
*  And boy, did he run with it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=784.0s)]
*  In fact, he ran further than a lot of people even thought the law let him in tailoring the oversight of those banks in order to make it as weak as possible. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=787.0s)]
*  And by the way, just a little side note, I very much opposed his being re-nominated to the Federal Reserve Bank. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=801.0s)]
*  And the reason was exactly this. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=807.0s)]
*  What he had done on using the opportunities he had by the change in the law in 2018 to weaken bank regulations. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=809.0s)]
*  In my view, he was just headed in the wrong direction. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=820.0s)]
*  And that's what made him dangerous in the position of chair of the Fed. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=822.0s)]
*  But then there's part three, and that is those executives, those bank CEOs who lobbied hard to get this change in the law. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=829.0s)]
*  Those are the ones who, when the window opened, wow, were they ready to go. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=839.0s)]
*  And they went out and they decided to load up on risk. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=845.0s)]
*  And why? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=851.0s)]
*  They loaded up on risk because it made their banks more profitable. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=853.0s)]
*  And that meant it made them have higher salaries. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=856.0s)]
*  They got to rule over bigger banks. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=859.0s)]
*  They got big bonuses. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=862.0s)]
*  They brought in their friends. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=864.0s)]
*  And they did all that by taking on more risk. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=866.0s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=870.0s)]
*  SVB increased its profitability of the last three years by 40 percent. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=871.0s)]
*  They took on all that risk, made themselves more profitable right up to the day that the bank exploded. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=879.0s)]
*  And that's the whole story. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=886.0s)]
*  Part one, the Congress, part two, the regulators, and part three, the executives who took advantage of this. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=890.0s)]
*  People around the country watching this right now, and I think people around the country trust you on these issues [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=897.0s)]
*  because this is how we all get to know you as a public figure in the first place was explaining these difficult and scary things, particularly in moments of crisis. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=902.0s)]
*  People around the country watching you right now who don't have deposits at Silvergate or at Silicon Valley Bank or at Signature may not have even heard of some of these banks, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=910.0s)]
*  have their deposits in other community banks or in big banks. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=919.0s)]
*  They're wondering if this is a problem that is specific to the tech industry, which is the Silicon Valley Bank, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=922.0s)]
*  and the crypto industry, which seems to have been tied to Signature and to Silvergate, these other banks. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=930.0s)]
*  People are wondering if this is something that's confined to sort of niche areas of the economy or if this is something that these same kind of criticisms that you're describing apply to other kinds of banks and potentially even bigger banks as well. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=935.0s)]
*  So when you talked about regulation, one little twist on it is that we really have had since Dodd-Frank a kind of two-tier regulatory system, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=948.0s)]
*  one for the community banks that is pretty light touch regulation. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=959.0s)]
*  It says in effect they didn't cause the crash back in 2008, and they're not going to cause a crash later on. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=964.0s)]
*  They are pretty simple how they're run, pretty straightforward. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=971.0s)]
*  They serve their communities, and frankly, they don't need a whole lot of oversight. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=976.0s)]
*  That's great, and it works well. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=980.0s)]
*  If you have your money in a bank like that, good for you. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=982.0s)]
*  It'll be fine. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=985.0s)]
*  The very largest banks still have the tougher regulation that Dodd-Frank put in place, the great big name brand banks. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=987.0s)]
*  What happened is these banks, they're often called regional banks, although they're really national, is this tier of banks that are big that the old line had been anybody with more than $50 billion in assets is going to be subject to these stronger regulations. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=997.0s)]
*  They got it changed to $250 billion. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1010.0s)]
*  And what you have is this tier of banks that are big that the old line had been anybody with more than $50 billion in assets is going to be subject to these stronger regulations. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1013.0s)]
*  They got it changed to $250 billion. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1020.0s)]
*  And what you have is this group of very aggressive banks, some more aggressive than others, some run in wilder ways than others. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1025.0s)]
*  But that's where the problem is in the system. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1034.0s)]
*  What the President of the United States has now said, and I want to stop here and say, boy, am I glad that Joe Biden is President of the United States right now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1037.0s)]
*  He approached this in a way that is very calm, stayed right on top of it, and said, we're going to have to do something different here. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1046.0s)]
*  We're going to have to tell all those small businesses who've got their money in those banks, all those nonprofits who've got their money in those banks, all those folks who are worried about meeting payroll when Monday rolls around, their money is fully protected. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1054.0s)]
*  And that's what everybody at home needs to know. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1071.0s)]
*  If you're a depositor in one of these banks, your money is fully protected. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1074.0s)]
*  Take a deep breath. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1079.0s)]
*  Nothing you need to worry about on that end of it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1081.0s)]
*  But our job is to think about the system overall. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1085.0s)]
*  And that means we need Congress to act. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1090.0s)]
*  Congress needs to roll back the Trump tax, the Trump bank regulation relief. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1093.0s)]
*  We need to we need to make a change in the laws because then that will affect the regulators and the regulators will make sure that they are engaging in closer supervision over those banks. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1101.0s)]
*  And that in turn will rein in any of the CEOs that think banking is a great place to get a multi-million dollar salary and a bunch of bonuses and your own jet plane. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1114.0s)]
*  Remember, you and I've talked about this before. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1128.0s)]
*  What should banking be? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1131.0s)]
*  Banking should be boring. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1132.0s)]
*  And anybody who wants to take a lot of risk and make a lot of money should not be in banking. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1134.0s)]
*  Banking should be boring. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1140.0s)]
*  And that's how we need to make some changes in the law. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1142.0s)]
*  We Congress need to go back. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1146.0s)]
*  We need to get rid of the Trump banking bill and go back to better regulation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1148.0s)]
*  We do that. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1154.0s)]
*  We'll make banking boring again. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1155.0s)]
*  Sign of a functioning democracy and a well-run holiday is when people not only is banking boring, but when people are right and everybody else is wrong and it becomes crystal clear on days like this, the people who are right get to have the last word about it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1157.0s)]
*  At least get to be the ones who get the pride of place. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1173.0s)]
*  And Senator Elizabeth Warren, that's why on days like this we turn to you. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1176.0s)]
*  Thank you for your clarity as always. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1179.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1181.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1182.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1185.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppt6mY0gL50&t=1215.0s)]
