# Criminal Investigation Of Trump In Georgia Takes Key Step With Special Grand Jury Request
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A)
*  So, this is the letter today from the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=0.0s)]
*  county's chief judge. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Quote, dear Chief Judge Brasher, I hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=7.12s)]
*  Excellent start. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=12.36s)]
*  Quote, please be advised that the district attorney's office has received information [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=13.36s)]
*  indicating a reasonable probability that the state of Georgia's administration of elections [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=17.0s)]
*  in 2020, including the state's election of the president of the United States, was subject [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  to possible criminal disruptions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=26.92s)]
*  Therefore, I am hereby requesting, as the elected district attorney for Fulton County, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=29.48s)]
*  that a special purpose grand jury be impaneled for the purpose of investigating the facts [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=34.440000000000005s)]
*  and circumstances relating directly or indirectly to possible attempts to disrupt the lawful [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=38.24s)]
*  administration of the 2020 elections in the state of Georgia. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=43.52s)]
*  But then there's also the sort of, just almost surreal point. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=48.28s)]
*  It's a true assertion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  It's just bizarre. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=54.72s)]
*  And she puts this right up front in her letter to the county judge today as to why her office [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=56.96s)]
*  needs this special grand jury, which is that conceivably there are lots of law enforcement [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=60.8s)]
*  agencies in Georgia who could take up this matter. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=67.92s)]
*  If in fact there's reasonable suspicion that Georgia's statewide elections were criminally [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=71.48s)]
*  interfered with, why does it have to be the Fulton County district attorney who pursues [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  the evidence and tries to put together the prosecution? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=81.6s)]
*  Why that one county prosecutor's office? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=84.16s)]
*  Well, she makes a very good case. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=87.2s)]
*  It's because every other law enforcement agency that could conceivably be investigating [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  this was a potential witness to the alleged crime. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=94.28s)]
*  The Georgia secretary of state's office, that was one of the targets of the alleged [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=99.08s)]
*  perpetrators of this scheme. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=102.32s)]
*  The Georgia attorney general's office, also one of the targets of the alleged perpetrators [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=103.88s)]
*  of this scheme. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. attorney's office, the federal prosecutor's office in Georgia, that was one of the targets [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  of the alleged perpetrators of this scheme. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=114.32s)]
*  So you know, if your office is inside the crime scene tape, that makes it hard for your [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=117.56s)]
*  office to be the entity investigating the crime scene. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=123.96s)]
*  Therefore, quote, this office, meaning the Fulton County DA's office, is the sole agency [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=127.36s)]
*  with jurisdiction that's not a potential witness to conduct related to this matter. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=132.86s)]
*  As a result, our office has opened an investigation into any coordinated attempts to unlawfully [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=137.54s)]
*  alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=142.6s)]
*  Just a on top of everything else, just a remarkable development today in the great state of Georgia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now is Gwen Keese-Fleming. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=153.2s)]
*  Ms. Keese-Fleming is the former district attorney in Dekalb County, which is right next to Fulton County. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=156.2s)]
*  She has known Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis for years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Ms. Keese-Fleming, you have helped us understand so much about this case up until now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=163.4s)]
*  I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight now that this big step has happened. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=167.24s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=172.4s)]
*  So the last time you were here, we talked about the prospect that D.A. Willis might [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=174.16s)]
*  move to impanel a special grand jury. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=179.16s)]
*  What does it say to you? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=182.08s)]
*  What's important for us to understand now that she's done it and now that we're able [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=183.32s)]
*  to see the reasoning for doing it that she's laid out in this letter? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=186.4s)]
*  Well, I think it's a smart move and a strategic move. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=191.72s)]
*  She has indicated previously that she would be methodically working through all of the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=195.56s)]
*  evidence in this case and use all of the resources available to her to do just that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=200.56s)]
*  And a special grand jury is one of those tools and resources that allows her to subpoena [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=206.56s)]
*  witnesses. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=212.44s)]
*  She notes in the letter that she has run into the challenge of some witnesses not coming [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  forth and talking to her office voluntarily. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=218.84s)]
*  This signals to me that she did not prematurely ask for a special grand jury. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=221.96s)]
*  She has done and she and her team have done significant investigation up until this point [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=226.8s)]
*  and are only making this request at the point that she needs the help from the court. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=232.64s)]
*  The special grand jury also, as she notes, will not be constrained by a two month time [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=238.6s)]
*  limit that a regular criminal grand jury has, which also means that this dedicated group [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=243.48s)]
*  of Fulton County residents will be able to focus on this one case and this one case only [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=249.64s)]
*  for as long as it takes to get to or complete the investigation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=255.64s)]
*  In my experience, when I was DA, we had special grand juries that were handled for as long [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=260.2s)]
*  as a year. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=264.76s)]
*  That's not to say it will take that long in this matter. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=265.96s)]
*  But again, it removes one of the obstacles in terms of having to make a decision in a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  certain time frame, particularly when you're investigating investigating a case as complex [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  as this one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=280.36s)]
*  And you don't know where all of the evidence is going to lead. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=281.56s)]
*  The early witnesses that are subpoenaed may lead to more subpoenas, more questions, the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=284.8s)]
*  need for more documents. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  And so this is the beginning for her of a very long investigation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=291.0s)]
*  How rare are special grand juries in Georgia? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=298.8s)]
*  I'm thinking about the chief county judge who received this request today and what I [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  learned today about how this will be decided, which is that a majority of the judges in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=307.36s)]
*  the county need to need to say yes in order for this for this request to be granted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=312.4s)]
*  How frequently is something like this pursuit? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=318.56s)]
*  Not frequently. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=323.28s)]
*  And again, it's usually reserved for cases that are either they span crimes in a long [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=324.28s)]
*  span of time, years in some instances, or they're very complex. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=330.32s)]
*  And if you recall some of the earlier statements, D.A. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=335.76s)]
*  Willis has made, she was looking at four different elements here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=339.04s)]
*  She was looking at the January 2nd call. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  She was looking at the January 4th resignation of the U.S. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=346.88000000000005s)]
*  attorney. She was looking at an earlier November call between one of the senators and the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=350.6s)]
*  secretary of state's office. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=356.24s)]
*  And she was also looking at statements that were made to the Georgia legislature. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  So she this demonstrates the complexity and why a special grand jury would be warranted in this case. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=363.2s)]
*  I think it's also important to point out with the judges both because she is seeking this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=370.08s)]
*  grand jury in light of reticence of some people coming forward to talk with her office to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=376.24s)]
*  continue the investigation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  I think it's critical that she mentioned that because it's very unlikely that judges will [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=385.76s)]
*  reward that opposition by denying her request. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=389.96s)]
*  Again, if they say no, then all of the evidence that she needs will never come to light. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=394.08s)]
*  And so, again, judges taking oath just like prosecutors, it's their duty to uphold the law. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=400.08s)]
*  And again, this grand jury is the best opportunity to fully vet all of the evidence that's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  available and they can make recommendations as to what charges, if any, should be brought. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=410.67999999999995s)]
*  Is it notable that D.A. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=416.92s)]
*  Willis has requested that an individual county judge be appointed to oversee the special grand [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  jury and supervise their work? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=426.04s)]
*  Or is that just how these things are handled? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=427.6s)]
*  That's how these things are handled. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  That's a part of the statute. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  And it helps her in the event that there is any sort of dispute with the particular witness, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=432.76s)]
*  particularly if that witness hires counsel and they want to contest the subpoena. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  It allows to have one judge that would resolve all of those issues over the course of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=442.44s)]
*  impanelment of the special grand jury rather than it going to different judges on different [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=448.32s)]
*  case. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-YeX7SU2A&t=452.64s)]
