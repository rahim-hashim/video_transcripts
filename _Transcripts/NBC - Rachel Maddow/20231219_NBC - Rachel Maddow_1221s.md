# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Dec. 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc)
*  You know, nobody is a Nazi but a Nazi. Nobody is Hitler but Hitler. Nobody is Mussolini but Mussolini. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=0.0s)]
*  Right? There's no point in making—and there's no cause to make any sort of modern analogy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=5.84s)]
*  to the fascist dictatorships of the 1930s. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=12.4s)]
*  But we are having this weird moment in American news and politics right now where half the country [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=16.48s)]
*  is shouting about how the Republican presidential nominee keeps quoting those dictators. He keeps [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=22.72s)]
*  saying the kinds of things, the exact kind of things that Hitler and Mussolini said as they [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=28.72s)]
*  ascended to and consolidated power. And you see those—the names of those dictators and you see [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=33.92s)]
*  the discussion of that period in history all over the news right now because he is saying those [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  things. He is effectively quoting Mussolini and Hitler in some of their most effective [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=44.72s)]
*  propagandistic tactics. But pointing out that he's saying Hitler-esque and Mussolini-esque things [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=49.92s)]
*  turns out to not be enough to make him stop saying those things. He doesn't mind being compared to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=56.88s)]
*  those people. Why is he willing to keep saying those things despite everybody pointing out, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=65.84s)]
*  hey, that's what Hitler said, hey, that's what Mussolini said, you don't want to be a Hitler or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=74.48s)]
*  a Mussolini, do you? Why is it not enough to stop him from using those tactics, from saying those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=78.56s)]
*  things, from trying to make people think about the world that way? It's not enough because [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=86.16s)]
*  those things work for him. There is a reason that it is, you know, it's dictators and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=93.92s)]
*  authoritarians who talk about their internal enemies being vermin who have to be rooted out [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=100.64s)]
*  or exterminated. There's a reason that it's dictators and authoritarians who talk about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=105.52s)]
*  immigrants poisoning the blood of the country. There's a reason they do it, which is that it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=110.24s)]
*  works on people. It makes people want to put a strong man in charge to break all the rules and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=114.56s)]
*  destroy those very scary enemies, right? Iron fist. There's been all this discussion, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=120.16s)]
*  I know, in the past few days about the former president, the Republican presidential frontrunner [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=127.04s)]
*  playing this fascist dictator greatest hits mixtape, right? I do want to be a dictator. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=132.4s)]
*  I will root out the vermin amongst us, the Marxist communist vermin. You know, immigrants are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=137.12s)]
*  poisoning the blood of our country. There's been a lot of discussion about that in recent days, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=141.92s)]
*  and there should be. But pointing at it and saying that sounds really dictator-y isn't enough, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  right? Why is it that even after everybody pointed out that those were Hitler-esque [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=154.64s)]
*  and Mussolini-esque statements, he kept doing them, right? These are things he has tried out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=158.88s)]
*  in the last few weeks. He is now repeating them. He is putting them in writing. He is making them [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=164.32s)]
*  part of his regular speeches. Why is he doing that? Because these things are getting a good [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=168.16s)]
*  response. A good response. A response that he likes. Not just the outrage of his critics, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=172.72s)]
*  which he likes, but the pleasure and support of the people who like him the most. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=178.0s)]
*  In a Des Moines Register poll this weekend, this is the Des Moines Register NBC News Media [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=185.68s)]
*  Com Iowa poll this weekend, that poll asked Iowa Republicans about Trump's recent statements along [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  these lines. The poll asked whether these comments from Trump would make you more or less likely to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=196.0s)]
*  support him, Iowa Republican. And the answers are worth paying attention to. On his claim that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=204.4s)]
*  immigrants are poisoning the blood of America, which is straight out of Mein Kampf. On the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=212.24s)]
*  the vermin in the United States that needs to be rooted out, which comes straight out of the playbook [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=218.96s)]
*  of Mussolini and Hitler. Even on his pledge to build giant camps to hold millions of people in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=224.48s)]
*  this country. On those statements, Iowa Republican voters say as of this weekend that those statements [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  from Trump make them more likely to vote for him, not less. These things that Trump is saying right [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=235.76s)]
*  now, they sound familiar, not just because he's going for shock value, not just because he's going [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  for the transgressive thrill of saying things that famous dictators and genocidal maniacs have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=249.6s)]
*  said in the past. The reason these things sound familiar and he started to repeat them and started [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=254.88s)]
*  to make them part of his regular repertoire is because this stuff works. There's a reason [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=260.8s)]
*  Hitler and Mussolini said this stuff too. It worked then, it works now. It has worked abroad, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=266.32s)]
*  all over the world, and yes, it has worked here too, more than we like to remember, which is why [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=271.28s)]
*  I wrote this book this year. It's not just a bad and dangerous thing he's doing that you can stop [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=276.88s)]
*  him from doing by pointing out that it's bad and dangerous. This kind of rhetoric, trying to turn [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=284.96s)]
*  Americans not just against each other, but to the idea that some people among us are so dangerous [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=291.04s)]
*  that they must be exterminated, that some threats to us justify terminating the Constitution, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=299.36s)]
*  that justify being a dictator if only for a day. This is the sort of thing that has a political [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  point. It is designed to make you believe that a democratic system with checks and balances and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=310.8s)]
*  the constraint of the rule of law and elections where people are voted out sometimes and divided [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=316.8s)]
*  power within government, those things are not up to stopping these terrible evils that threaten us, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=321.68s)]
*  the terrible threat that some people among us pose to the rest of us. This stuff is tactically [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  efficient. It's designed to make us think that we need a strong man, we need a tough man, we don't [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=332.88s)]
*  need a legal system and all its constraints, we don't need a court system, we don't really need [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=338.64s)]
*  a political process, we don't need politicians, we don't need Congress, we need strength, will, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=342.32s)]
*  action, revenge, broken rules, maybe even violence. These statements are not just supposed to shock [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=348.88s)]
*  you, they're supposed to work on you, to make you believe we need something new and extreme, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=357.04s)]
*  to deal with our terrible problems, if only for a little while maybe, maybe just a temporary [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=362.32s)]
*  dictatorship. And these tactics have a terrible history of working really well in other countries [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=367.44s)]
*  and yes, here in our past. Once you realize that it is a political tactic, well then how do you [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=375.6s)]
*  stop it from working? If it has worked well in the past, what have we learned from the past about how [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=384.0s)]
*  to stop it from working so well again? Well, it's not rocket science, but it does take work [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=389.2s)]
*  and right now. I mean, I think it should hopefully go without saying that one thing that needs to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=396.24s)]
*  done is to refuse personally, individually, all of us to play any part in any politics that depends [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  on you thinking of your political opponents as monsters. To refuse to participate in any politics [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=410.56s)]
*  that depends on any group in society being seen as a menace, as something that needs to be eliminated [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=418.32s)]
*  or rooted out. It means standing up for any group that is being targeted that way. And yes, there is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=424.48s)]
*  a role for regular citizens in that. Thank you to the Daphne Alabama church that offered its church [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=433.36s)]
*  facilities, to the local synagogue down the road that had to flee in the face of that bomb threat [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=439.28s)]
*  before its own Saturday services this weekend. There's a space there for regular people, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=444.0s)]
*  but there's also a place for law enforcement. As I said, the Massachusetts attorney general is here [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=451.44s)]
*  next. It also means that the legal system has to be both used and defended, right? The legal system [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=456.0s)]
*  needs to play a role in prosecuting crimes, upholding the idea that the rule of law still applies, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=465.6s)]
*  and it needs to be protected from political pressure and intimidation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  It also means we need to both use and defend the political system that we do have [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=480.08s)]
*  that the anti-democratic forces among us want us to abandon. When they attack not just election [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=486.56s)]
*  results, but election workers, that is part of breaking the small d democratic system, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=493.67999999999995s)]
*  which of course makes it easier for us all to imagine throwing it away. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  Tonight, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss to Georgia election workers have sued Trump lawyer Rudy [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=506.32s)]
*  Giuliani again to stop him from defaming and attacking them further after a court awarded [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=512.24s)]
*  them $148 million in damages for his previous defamation and attacks. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=519.04s)]
*  So protecting people like that, making sure that people like that are both protected and [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=523.6s)]
*  that the system works for them to get justice. That's part of it too. Standing up for people [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=531.52s)]
*  who are being attacked and scapegoated, stopping violence and intimidation in the political system, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=536.4s)]
*  both through solidarity at a regular human level, but also through law enforcement, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=541.12s)]
*  defending not just the idea of elections as an abstract, but the people who make elections work [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=545.44s)]
*  at a nuts and bolts level, refusing to give into the idea that we're somehow different kinds of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=551.76s)]
*  humans, that we need an iron fist to protect one another, to protect us from one another more than [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=556.8s)]
*  we need democracy. You can't just object to these tactics and say, wow, that's what dictators of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=562.16s)]
*  your have used. It's to recognize that dictators of your have used those things because these [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=570.64s)]
*  tactics have been effective at getting people to want to give up democracy and to put themselves [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=578.48s)]
*  in the hands of a strong man leader instead. It's recognizing that this stuff isn't just offensive, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=584.64s)]
*  it works. And it's not history, it's now. We do not get to point out Florida very often as an [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=591.28s)]
*  example of how our small d democratic institutions are supposed to work. Florida, a place where things [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=599.52s)]
*  are being done right. That happens very rarely. But bear with me here. I swear that's where this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=606.48s)]
*  is going. Here goes. For the past few weeks, the Florida Republican Party has been trying to figure [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=612.08s)]
*  out what to do about its state Republican Party chairman. He has been accused of sexual assault, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=616.5600000000001s)]
*  of rape. And beyond the alleged criminality and the details of the allegation against him are harrowing, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=622.32s)]
*  a search warrant in the case shows that the background of this case is a prior sexual [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=630.08s)]
*  relationship between the accuser, a woman, the Florida Republican Party chairman, a man, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  and also his wife, the three of them together in a thing. The aforementioned wife of the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=642.96s)]
*  Republican Party chairman is a founder of the anti-gay book banning group, Moms for Liberty. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=650.0s)]
*  She says she personally helped write the Florida don't say gay law, despite what was apparently [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=655.52s)]
*  going on in her own. Yeah. Anyway, the combination of the sort of hypocrisy at this epic level [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  and the electoral politics here and the alleged crime here is a lot even by Florida standards. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  And the chairman of the state Republican Party is still maintaining his innocence. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=677.76s)]
*  But yesterday, the executive board of the Florida Republican Party took action against him. They [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=681.36s)]
*  voted to strip him of his authority as state party chair. They reduced his salary to one dollar. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=687.12s)]
*  They censured him and they told him to resign. And in one sense, you can make it this what you [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=692.88s)]
*  want, right? Whether Florida Republicans are taking action because their chairman's wife appears to [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=698.48s)]
*  have been both against and also into the gay at the same time, whether they're repelled by the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=702.64s)]
*  specific allegations, whether they're just trying to make the scandal go away so it doesn't cost [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=709.68s)]
*  them in the upcoming elections, whatever. The point here is that the example the Florida Republicans [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=713.68s)]
*  are setting political parties turns out are not inert bystanders that have no power when it comes [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=721.28s)]
*  to deciding who gets to be in charge in politics and specifically in their party. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  Political parties can police themselves. Even people who fight back against censure, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=733.28s)]
*  they can still be censured. They can have their salary reduced to a dollar. All of their power [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=740.88s)]
*  can be taken away. Political parties are institutions that can play an important role [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  in policing bad behavior by political actors. This is how institutions in our small d democracy are [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=751.6s)]
*  supposed to work. If you want them to. You may have seen the news this weekend that Alex Jones, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=757.2s)]
*  the Florida conspiracy theorist and purveyor of very, very manly dietary supplements, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=764.24s)]
*  he's trying to figure out a way to get out of paying almost all of the billion and a half dollars [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=771.36s)]
*  that he has been assigned to pay to the families he was found guilty of defaming. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=777.6s)]
*  These are families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School Massacre. They [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=783.04s)]
*  filed a civil suit against Alex Jones for the years that Mr. Jones spent calling that massacre [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=787.36s)]
*  a hoax on his media network. A court awarded those families a billion and a half dollars [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  in damages from Alex Jones. Mr. Jones is now asking them, okay, well, would you take [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=800.0799999999999s)]
*  roughly three and a half percent of that instead? How about a 96% discount off those damages? How [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=806.24s)]
*  about I propose to pay you not $1.5 billion, but $55 million? That's his offer in bankruptcy court. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=812.72s)]
*  The Sandy Hook families, you will not be surprised to learn, have a different idea. They say, hey, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  how about instead we just liquidate your business assets right now, including your media company, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=826.4s)]
*  and give the proceeds to the families. Mr. Jones would be allowed to keep his house, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=830.96s)]
*  but Alex Jones incorporated goes away permanently. In other words, we don't want to share in your [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=836.32s)]
*  profits. We want your company, which profited for so many years off of our grief. We want that company [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=842.64s)]
*  gone. Another example of what a civil suit can do, the $148 million jury verdict against Rudy [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  Giuliani for the lies he spread about two Georgia election workers, lies about them stealing the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=855.52s)]
*  election from Donald Trump, lies that upended their lives. Nobody knows what Mr. Giuliani is capable [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=861.3599999999999s)]
*  of paying or what this judgment might mean for him and his livelihood. But now those two election [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=866.9599999999999s)]
*  workers today filed a new lawsuit against Giuliani because even after that $148 million verdict [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=871.68s)]
*  against him, he went immediately right back to spouting the same lies that got him slapped with [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=878.56s)]
*  that huge judgment. Civil suits have also though been used strategically against, for lack of a [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=883.3599999999999s)]
*  better term, neo-Nazis. You may recall the civil lawsuit that was filed against the white nationalist [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  neo-Nazi organizers of the unite the right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 that resulted in a jury [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=898.0s)]
*  award of over $26 million in damages against the organizers. That kind of penalty can restrict the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=904.64s)]
*  ability of groups like that to operate. It can even potentially put them out of business entirely. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=912.32s)]
*  Well, keep that in mind. Now that we know we have a couple new lawsuits, a couple new legal actions [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=918.32s)]
*  along those same lines taken within days of one another. One by the attorney general of the state [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=924.24s)]
*  of Massachusetts, one by the attorney general of the state of New Hampshire. Each of them have taken [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=930.0s)]
*  legal action against the white nationalist group NSC 131, 113. This is how these groups like to be [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=934.4s)]
*  known, these guys, by their acronym. NSC, to be clear, NSC stands for National Socialist Club, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=942.96s)]
*  as in National Socialism, as in Nazis. These guys are self-declared Nazis. And in both states, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=949.76s)]
*  the group is being sued for violent harassment and intimidation of minorities and immigrants. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=955.04s)]
*  But the group has been engaged in all kinds of activity like this across New England [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=962.0s)]
*  for the past several years. New Hampshire filed its first civil suit against the group earlier [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  this year after the group hung a keep New England white banner off a highway overpass. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=972.64s)]
*  That suit was dismissed, but now the group is facing two of these legal actions in two states. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  How effective is that likely to be? How good is this as a tactic against this kind of [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=985.4399999999999s)]
*  terroristic menace? Joining us now is Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=991.4399999999999s)]
*  Her office has just taken legal action against this neo-Nazi group in New England. Ms. Campbell, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=997.5999999999999s)]
*  thanks very much for your time this evening. I appreciate you being here. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1001.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1004.64s)]
*  So first of all, let me just ask you, I didn't explain it in fulsome detail, but [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1006.7199999999999s)]
*  did I get the basics right here in terms of the idea behind this legal action? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1011.3599999999999s)]
*  Pretty much. I mean, this is like you described a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi group founded here in [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1017.92s)]
*  Massachusetts, sadly, that has put out publicly that they think that New England is and should [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1024.48s)]
*  be only for white people in a certain type of white demographic. And we're not going after them [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1032.24s)]
*  because of those beliefs. Frankly, I've been saying if they held those beliefs in meetings [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1037.6s)]
*  in private settings, I probably wouldn't attend the meeting. But that's not where we're going [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1042.4s)]
*  after them. We're going after them because of just the horrific conduct and unlawful conduct [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1046.72s)]
*  of terrorizing folks of different demographics all across the Commonwealth, whether migrants, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1052.64s)]
*  those in LGBTQ plus community, or anyone, and saying that conduct is unlawful and unacceptable [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1057.92s)]
*  here in Massachusetts. And so we think we have a pretty strong case. We're excited to also see New [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1063.76s)]
*  Hampshire also launch a complaint, which I think is very powerful to have a Republican attorney [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1068.48s)]
*  general and a Democratic AG taking on this group for their conduct here and of course across New [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1072.88s)]
*  England. And it's an important point that this is a nonpartisan situation here in New England, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1078.4s)]
*  that we've got a Republican AG in New Hampshire taking action there under the state's non-discrimination [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1085.44s)]
*  laws. You're a Democrat in Massachusetts taking a slightly different approach, but targeting the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  same group. Can you just explain, I'm trying to think kind of big picture and nationwide about [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1094.72s)]
*  the options that law enforcement officials have in terms of using the legal system in constructive [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1100.48s)]
*  ways, both to protect the constitution, but also to protect people from this kind of menace. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1107.44s)]
*  Why did you see the advantage here of civil litigation and civil litigation of this kind? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1112.0s)]
*  In a best case scenario, what do you think the impact of the litigation will be? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1117.44s)]
*  So there are some criminal aspects to their conduct and there have been district attorneys [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  in Massachusetts that have attempted to take that on and sometimes unsuccessfully. They're [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1128.96s)]
*  very difficult cases to prosecute. But here we have not only a strong basis under our civil [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1133.12s)]
*  rights law, which are quite progressive in Massachusetts to going after the conduct of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1139.6s)]
*  this group. But in addition to that, for violations of our trespass laws, our nuisance laws and our [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1143.36s)]
*  public accommodation laws. And our goal is to seek injunctive relief, to get them to stop what [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1150.0s)]
*  they're doing, patrolling people's neighborhoods, targeting particular demographics, and thereby [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  blocking the access sometimes to public spaces, for example, for all of us. I've been telling folks, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1160.9599999999998s)]
*  this isn't just about targeting specific groups. This is about blocking access and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1166.24s)]
*  violating the rights of many residents in Massachusetts and those who visit Massachusetts. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1170.4s)]
*  So we think we have a strong case. But the other hook that is really important, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1176.0s)]
*  as we seek injunctive relief here, if they violate our civil rights law in that injunction, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1179.2s)]
*  we can see criminal penalties. So there's a range of options available to us. We're at the beginning [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1185.6s)]
*  stages. But I think it sets the tone that we're going to take on this type of behavior [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1190.4s)]
*  and not just allow it to persist in Massachusetts going forward. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQiAYnvCAc&t=1196.3200000000002s)]
