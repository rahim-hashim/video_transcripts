# Republican congressman's biography falls apart under scrutiny (no, not Santos)
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4)
*  Move over, George Santos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=0.0s)]
*  In what is turning out to be a remarkable freshman class [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=1.84s)]
*  of new Republican legislators in Washington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=4.84s)]
*  we've also got this gentleman, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=7.34s)]
*  Tennessee Republican Congressman Andy Ogles. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=8.78s)]
*  Mr. Ogles has described himself multiple times [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=11.98s)]
*  as an economist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=14.36s)]
*  Now, what is an economist, really? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=16.92s)]
*  Who can say? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=19.26s)]
*  They call it the dismal science for a reason. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=20.26s)]
*  But you might guess, at a minimum, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=22.8s)]
*  that if you're gonna call yourself an economist, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=24.6s)]
*  that implies you have some training in economics. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=26.44s)]
*  Alas, no. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=30.42s)]
*  News Channel 5, WTVF, in Nashville [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  has looked into that and discovered that, in fact, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=33.72s)]
*  Congressman Andy Ogles has no degree in economics. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=36.06s)]
*  WTVF found that Mr. Ogles, in his life, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=41.02s)]
*  has taken a grand total of one community college course [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=44.36s)]
*  in economics, which he barely passed, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=47.8s)]
*  and that was the extent of his collegiate work [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  in the subject. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=52.5s)]
*  Congressman Ogles also said that he graduated [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=54.099999999999994s)]
*  from Vanderbilt's Graduate Business School, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=56.98s)]
*  which would be very impressive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=59.54s)]
*  In reality, he reportedly took executive education classes, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=62.48s)]
*  which is a short-term, non-degree program [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=66.62s)]
*  where you get a certificate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=68.92s)]
*  Thanks for showing up. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=70.12s)]
*  Not actually a graduate degree, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=71.62s)]
*  which requires years of commitment. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Congressman Andy Ogles also claimed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=77.36s)]
*  that he was a former member of law enforcement [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=79.06s)]
*  who worked in international sex crimes, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=81.5s)]
*  specifically child trafficking. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  That experience in law enforcement [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=86.16s)]
*  maybe was him serving for two years [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=88.3s)]
*  as a volunteer reserve deputy [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=91.46s)]
*  in one county sheriff's office, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=94.33999999999999s)]
*  a volunteer position from which, according to WTVF, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=96.08s)]
*  he was released because he didn't meet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  the minimum standards even for that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=101.78s)]
*  For good measure, that sheriff's office said [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=103.94s)]
*  that Congressman Ogles had no involvement [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=105.72s)]
*  in international sex crimes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=108.13999999999999s)]
*  Congressman Santos, I mean Ogles, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=111.06s)]
*  also claimed to have a degree in international relations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=113.14s)]
*  Turns out that too is a lie, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=117.98s)]
*  and he's sort of now admitting that that's horse hockey. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=120.22s)]
*  A little over a week ago, his office was saying [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=124.22s)]
*  it was a simple case of condensing a resume [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=126.16s)]
*  for the sake of brevity on the campaign trail, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=129.6s)]
*  and it's partisan hacks who are trying to turn this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=132.04s)]
*  into a headline for clicks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=134.34s)]
*  That was last week. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=136.34s)]
*  Now this week, we have a new explanation for his claim [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  that he earned a degree in international relations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=140.46s)]
*  Congressman today released a statement saying, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=143.32s)]
*  I previously stated my degree was in international relations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=145.6s)]
*  When I pulled up my transcript to verify, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=149.3s)]
*  I realized I was mistaken. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=151.8s)]
*  My degree, turns out, is in liberal studies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=153.78s)]
*  I apologize for my misstatement. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=158.52s)]
*  Who among us hasn't completely forgotten [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=162.48s)]
*  what we majored in in college [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=164.78s)]
*  and had to check it on the transcript? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=166.72s)]
*  I do wonder if there's something about the words [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=170.92s)]
*  majored in liberal studies that could explain [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=172.9s)]
*  why this Republican in Congress left that out [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=176.5s)]
*  of his biography and made something else instead. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=179.34s)]
*  What kind of studies did you say? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=182.5s)]
*  What do you have an actual degree in? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=184.68s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1bFjQseP4&t=187.9s)]
