# 'He wasn't thinking about Melania': Cohen reveals Trump's priorities in covering up Stormy story
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU)
*  Question, did you bring up at the time the topic of his wife, Melania, in one of those [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=0.0s)]
*  conversations with Mr. Trump? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=4.92s)]
*  Answer, I did. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Question, what did you say in substance to him? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=8.16s)]
*  Answer, I said to him, and how's things going to go with upstairs? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=10.4s)]
*  Question, were you concerned about that? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=15.08s)]
*  Answer, I was. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Question, and what, if anything, did he say to you about that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=19.92s)]
*  Answer, don't worry, he goes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=23.76s)]
*  He goes, how long do you think I will be on the market for? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=26.48s)]
*  Not long. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=30.4s)]
*  Question, what did you understand that to mean? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=31.96s)]
*  Answer, he wasn't thinking about Melania. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=35.24s)]
*  This was all about the campaign. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=38.56s)]
*  A few things, Nicole. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=41.4s)]
*  Women will hate me, guys may think it's cool. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=45.92s)]
*  I'm just going to leave that where it lies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But this, what I want you to do is push it out as long as you can, get past the election. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=50.96s)]
*  If I win, it has no relevance, I'll be president. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=55.44s)]
*  If I lose, I don't even care. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=57.44s)]
*  So that means this explains why they're not paying Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=59.6s)]
*  And in fact, them not paying Stormy Daniels almost results in them losing control of this [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=62.92s)]
*  and Stormy Daniels telling her story to ABC News. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=69.12s)]
*  They have to scramble, Michael pays himself, Michael Cohen pays himself, because they've [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=71.56s)]
*  almost lost it because they've been stringing it out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=75.96s)]
*  They want to string it out past the election and then never paying her at all. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=77.68s)]
*  But then the question about his wife, aren't you worried about your wife, what she will think? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=82.28s)]
*  Michael Cohen is describing a conversation with Donald Trump in which he's trying to elicit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Is there a reason for us to suppress this story other than the campaign? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=92.08s)]
*  And Trump effectively says, no, I don't care if she knows, I don't care if she's mad. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=96.08s)]
*  How long do you think I'll be on the market for? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=100.16s)]
*  Not long. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=102.36s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, he's not the first person to testify to Trump's singular concern with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=103.36s)]
*  And the other investigator and prosecutors that had access to David Pecker's unfiltered, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=107.92s)]
*  unlimited testimony was the Southern District of New York. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  And they found the same election crime to have taken place. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  They simply decided not to charge Trump and name him individual one and describe his role [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=119.72s)]
*  as, quote, directing Michael Cohen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=123.24s)]
*  So the facts are not in dispute by the other investigators that looked at this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=126.0s)]
*  No one who's come before this jury has testified to any motive other than the campaign. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=129.92s)]
*  And the real crisis, the thing that makes the Stormy Daniels payment different, in addition [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  to the crimes that were committed in the fraudulent business records, is that this is the one [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=140.0s)]
*  that happens in the compressed time period, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=144.16s)]
*  And Karen McDougall does come out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=146.6s)]
*  It comes out the Monday before the election. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=148.04s)]
*  And you've got all those conversations where Trump is telling Hope Hicks what to do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=149.88s)]
*  Hope Hicks says, no, I'm going to deny, deny, deny. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they are hyper aware of the political damage. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  And none of the witnesses that have come through have said anything about Trump being scared [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=159.6s)]
*  of money or worried about money. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=163.56s)]
*  I had a source that was inside the debate prep when Access Hollywood tape dropped. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=165.0s)]
*  And he told me he went upstairs with Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=170.0s)]
*  And Melania was very distraught. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=173.04s)]
*  Now, no one knows anything about anyone's marriage that isn't in that marriage. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=174.68s)]
*  So I have no idea what she's— [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=177.88s)]
*  Your source was in the room with Melania? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=179.2s)]
*  It was in the room for debate prep and then went up—I don't think Trump went upstairs [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=180.44s)]
*  alone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=183.28s)]
*  I don't think he was the only one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=184.28s)]
*  I think debate prep ended and a subset of that group went upstairs to the residence [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=185.28s)]
*  to deal with the statement, to deal with Melania. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=189.96s)]
*  I mean, I think a group of them came from—I don't think Ryan Spreebus went because his [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=192.16s)]
*  vote was to dump Trump from the ticket and see if they could switch a room with Mr. Mike [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=196.24s)]
*  Pence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=199.52s)]
*  But I think a few of them went upstairs from debate prep, which was in Trump Tower, to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=200.52s)]
*  the residence. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=204.96s)]
*  Melania was reportedly crying. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=205.96s)]
*  But again, we know, we don't know why she's crying. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=206.96s)]
*  Was she mortified? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=209.24s)]
*  Did she know? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=210.24s)]
*  Was she mad at him for getting out? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=211.24s)]
*  I mean, who knows? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  But his concerns about her were a very distant second, his political concerns about being [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=213.96s)]
*  what he's always afraid of being, a loser. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=218.84s)]
*  Chris, at the opening statements, Trump's defense counsel did say, did suggest that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=222.04s)]
*  the reason that Trump was paying this hush money or the reason that this response to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=228.2s)]
*  Stormy Daniels rolled out some of the way that it did, despite the parts that they deny, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=233.76s)]
*  is because he did what anybody would have done. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=238.24s)]
*  He was trying to avoid embarrassment, with the implication being that he was trying to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  avoid implication, the embarrassment to his family on this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=243.04s)]
*  It does seem to be repeatedly rebutted by multiple witnesses in this case. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=247.4s)]
*  It does. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=250.8s)]
*  And one thing that is a little unclear to me, I've referenced this before the John Edwards [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=251.8s)]
*  case in which they effectively used that as defense, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=254.6s)]
*  That when he was under trial, federal trial, for again, essentially campaign finance violations [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=258.24s)]
*  for paying off hush money, that it was fundamentally about protecting his wife, who you might remember [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=262.56s)]
*  the time was cancer stricken, and I think had a much more plausible case that that was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=267.08s)]
*  the case. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=270.52s)]
*  What I don't actually understand is what the standard is for the jury on this aspect of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=271.52s)]
*  the crime. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=276.48s)]
*  Meaning, like, they clearly falsified business records. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=277.8s)]
*  There clearly was a hush money payment. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  There's a huge amount of paper transaction. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=286.48s)]
*  The motive to it, we have multiple witnesses saying it was about the campaign and not Melania. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=288.76s)]
*  But there's not the same kind of, I mean, there's stuff in the evidentiary record. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  But no bank is going to have anything related to that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=300.04s)]
*  There's not a bank statement that says about the campaign, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=301.04s)]
*  And I guess my question is how much, whatever fuzziness a juror might feel about whether [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=303.48s)]
*  that's as firmly established as other things affects whether you can find that bill. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=308.92s)]
*  Katie, let me put that to you because we all are now familiar with these intricacies of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=313.8s)]
*  New York law that the reason this is a felony and not a misdemeanor, you can be charged [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=318.16s)]
*  with misdemeanor falsification of business records. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=322.5s)]
*  You're charged with a felony falsification of business records when it is used to commit [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  or conceal the commission of another crime. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=330.44s)]
*  But you don't have to prove the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=332.84s)]
*  So if the crime is influencing the election, it's an unfair, it's an illegal campaign expenditure. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=336.52s)]
*  They don't, what is the standard? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=342.32s)]
*  It doesn't have to be beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=344.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  So it's a great question because I think a lot of people went into today's testimony, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  if you're rooting for the prosecution, hoping to have the clarity from Michael Cohen's testimony. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=351.28s)]
*  So the underlying misdemeanors of falsification of the business records is the layup, as Chris [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=356.5s)]
*  says. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  But for what purpose? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=363.52s)]
*  Because that's what elevates it or punts it up to the felony. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=364.52s)]
*  That secondary offense, the subject offense of why would you want to falsify those business [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=367.32s)]
*  records, you don't have to prove that offense beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=373.32s)]
*  doubt. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=377.12s)]
*  You just have to point and say this is what we think it is. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=378.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=379.96000000000004s)]
*  And that is why you're hearing the campaign component so heavily here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  You're not hearing as much the tax side of it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=384.72s)]
*  You're hearing the campaign, campaign, campaign because that is the theory that the prosecution [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=386.88s)]
*  got up an opening and said is what the crime is. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=390.9s)]
*  That standard seems to me, watching this all develop, to matter a lot, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=394.78s)]
*  Because I do think if you were to ask me how much of they have established to me beyond [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  a reasonable doubt so far. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=403.58s)]
*  The misdemeanors. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=404.73999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, like they clearly, this was clearly fraudulent. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=405.73999999999995s)]
*  They clearly covered up this thing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=408.82s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  I think they have also established that it was for the campaign, but have they established [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=411.7s)]
*  it in my mind to the same level of rock solid, you know, as that other thing? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=415.34s)]
*  I would probably say no so far, but they don't need to. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=420.38s)]
*  But they don't need to. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=423.38s)]
*  But having the testimony from Cohen saying that Trump was in the room when they talked [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=424.38s)]
*  about the falsification gets you there. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=429.06s)]
*  That's why that was so important. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=431.85999999999996s)]
*  These things, it can be both. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  That's the most important part. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=436.09999999999997s)]
*  The jurors can think he did it for both reasons. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  And as long as the campaign is one of them, and certainly if it's the dominant one, then [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=440.53999999999996s)]
*  the case is made. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=445.5s)]
*  But they don't have to completely exclude some sort of motivation involving his wife. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=447.22s)]
*  However, Michael, the evidence, this is really important. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=452.42s)]
*  The evidence so far has excluded. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  Correct, yes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=458.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=459.74s)]
*  Michael Cohen, under oath in evidence, said he wasn't thinking about Melania. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=460.74s)]
*  You cannot get a clearer statement than that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=466.14s)]
*  Now, this is going to be important. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=468.66s)]
*  The judge is going to instruct on this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=470.5s)]
*  Nothing the Trump lawyers said in the opening is evidence. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=472.58s)]
*  The only thing that the witnesses said is evidence. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  The defense attorneys cross-examination questions are not evidence. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=480.3s)]
*  So what the cross-examination questions are going to be is, you lied about that, didn't [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=485.66s)]
*  you? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=489.82s)]
*  And Cohen's going to go, no. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=490.82s)]
*  That you lied about it isn't evidence. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=493.38s)]
*  They cannot and will not put Donald Trump on the witness stand, who's the only person [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=495.98s)]
*  alive who can present evidence against what Michael Cohen has said. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=500.86s)]
*  That's how you'd have to present evidence. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=506.1s)]
*  It has to be Trump saying, I never told him to do it and I absolutely did not reimburse [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=507.1s)]
*  him. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=512.98s)]
*  That was I was paying him to be my lawyer. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=513.98s)]
*  Trump would have to give you that indirect testimony from the defense. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=515.74s)]
*  He's not going to. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=519.9s)]
*  So the likelihood is you're going to go to the jury with nothing but the evidence presented [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=520.9s)]
*  by the prosecution. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=525.94s)]
*  You think it's a zero percent chance that Trump testifies? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=526.94s)]
*  Zero. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=529.14s)]
*  It always has been. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=530.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCPYVMxg9sU&t=531.14s)]
