# January 6 Hearing Connects Two Major Dots In Trump Coup Plot
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY)
*  This email suggests that Mr. Kukowsky was simultaneously working with Jeffrey Clark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=0.0s)]
*  to draft the proposed letter to Georgia officials to overturn their certified election, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=5.0s)]
*  working with Dr. Eastman to help pressure the vice president to overturn the election. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=10.8s)]
*  We did not know these things were connected. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=16.6s)]
*  We've got John Eastman, the architect of the whole fake electors scheme, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=18.76s)]
*  Apparently, he got his guy dropped into the Justice Department in the very last weeks [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=23.12s)]
*  of the Trump administration. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Trump lost the election the first week in November. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=29.479999999999997s)]
*  How do you then get a new Justice Department job in mid-December? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  But this guy did. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  He got dropped into the Justice Department, dropped specifically into Jeff Clark's office. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=37.44s)]
*  Eastman's guy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=42.92s)]
*  And Eastman's cockamamie legal theories then get included in this letter that the Justice [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=44.4s)]
*  Department is going to send out to overthrow the election in all of the swing states that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=50.04s)]
*  Trump lost. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=54.12s)]
*  Eastman and Trump's theory thereby appears to emerge organically from inside the Justice [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=56.04s)]
*  Department, but they engineered it by putting Eastman's guy at the Justice Department at [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=60.52s)]
*  the very last moment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=65.64s)]
*  We did not know about that before today, unless I'm mistaken? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=66.8s)]
*  And everyone involved in that has to be worried about this raid that Jeffrey Clark has now [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=70.56s)]
*  suffered at his home with the FBI running around while he's in his pajamas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=76.52s)]
*  That has a way of focusing the mind. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=80.2s)]
*  And they all have to think, is Jeff going to protect me in this situation? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=83.2s)]
*  The pressure on Jeff tonight, is he going to... [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  You're Klukowski, you're wondering, how well is Jeff going to protect me at this point? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=90.56s)]
*  All he knows how to do when asked a question, Jeffrey Clark, is give the Fifth Amendment. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=95.8s)]
*  That's the only answer he knows how to do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=101.08s)]
*  And so once he's faced with the rest of his life in front of him, as the FBI may lay out [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=103.72s)]
*  to him, here are your choices, he may abandon the Fifth Amendment, he may start talking [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=110.04s)]
*  about this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  You know that the worst thing for Jeffrey Clark is that it's been established that he's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  an idiot. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=117.28s)]
*  Because if he's an idiot, he couldn't have written this letter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  He couldn't have come up with it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  And so he eventually is going to have to tell him who put the ideas in here, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=121.84s)]
*  Who put Eastman's ideas? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=125.12s)]
*  Well, we know now that it's Eastman and Klukowski. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=126.12s)]
*  Eastman and Klukowski are working together. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=127.12s)]
*  They just... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=129.44s)]
*  Giving it to him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=130.44s)]
*  Who installs Klukowski at the Justice Department so he can do this? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=131.44s)]
*  So he can be the carrier pigeon for the Eastman ideas appearing to emerge from the Justice [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=133.8s)]
*  Department. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=139.0s)]
*  You have to know that he has to go in Jeff Clark's office. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=140.96s)]
*  So it's all about identifying who will help us in the Justice Department. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=143.92s)]
*  Who did that? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=149.0s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't just start looking down the list of names. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=150.0s)]
*  Someone figured out... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=152.96s)]
*  Perry told them Clark. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=153.96s)]
*  Perry said, get Clark's eyes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=154.96s)]
*  Perry is a guy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=155.96s)]
*  But how did they come together? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=156.96s)]
*  And so there's a real story in that that they're trying to get at, but the prosecutors have, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=159.0s)]
*  who now have material from Jeff Clark's home, they have much better powers to get at this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=165.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdLz_XlPpgY&t=195.52s)]
