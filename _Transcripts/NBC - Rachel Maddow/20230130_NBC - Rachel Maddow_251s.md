# Russia outlaws independent journalism outlet Meduza
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY)
*  Her name is Galina Timchenko. She was the chief editor of a Russian news website called Lenturu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=0.0s)]
*  And she was very good at that job, which is why, in the end, she was fired from that job. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=8.08s)]
*  It was in 2014, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, invaded Ukraine and took Crimea in 2014, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=12.4s)]
*  Galina Timchenko was fired from Lenturu after, under her leadership, Lenturu published an [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=20.32s)]
*  interview with a Ukrainian leader who was critical of the Kremlin. In response to her firing, more [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=27.28s)]
*  than 60 of Timchenko's rank-and-file reporters posted on the newspaper's website a statement of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  protest, and then they all followed her out the door. They all quit in protest of her firing, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=38.64s)]
*  60 of them. Galina Timchenko and her former team from Lenturu, they decided that they would build [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=44.24s)]
*  their own site, a new independent news organization, news written in Russian for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=52.24s)]
*  the Russian people. And they decided they would call themselves Medusa. Their motto is, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  the news returns, which makes sense once you know the story of why they were founded. Medusa decided [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=65.44s)]
*  they would set up their headquarters not inside Russia, but next door in Latvia, hoping that that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  would make it harder for the Russian government to meddle in their operations or to meddle with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=77.92s)]
*  their finances. They published Medusa content on their website, which is Medusa, M-E-D-U-Z-A dot I-O, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=81.52s)]
*  that's their website, but they also published it on an app, which is a harder thing for the Kremlin [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=88.96s)]
*  to block. And it worked at Medusa. It worked for a while, anyway. In 2021, Russia labeled Medusa a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=93.84s)]
*  foreign agent. That label was designed to scare away and threaten anybody who might advertise on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Medusa. And it had the desired effect. It made it almost impossible for Medusa to pay their bills. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=110.16s)]
*  Through it all, though, and at great personal risk, Medusa's journalists and their editors, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=116.96s)]
*  they somehow managed to keep themselves afloat. But even more than that, they really managed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=121.92s)]
*  to succeed. Medusa is the most read independent news source in the Russian language, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  which of course brings us to now. The Kremlin has now taken another swing, a big swing at Medusa, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=133.12s)]
*  labeling them no longer just as a foreign agent, but now is what the Kremlin calls a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=140.16s)]
*  undesirable organization that effectively outlaws the very existence of Medusa inside Russia. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  It means anybody inside Russia who visits Medusa's website, anybody who likes or interacts with any [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=151.36s)]
*  of Medusa's social media content, anybody who tries to share a link to one of their articles, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=156.8s)]
*  could be jailed for that in Russia. The designation that the Kremlin's just given this news organization [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=161.28s)]
*  gives authorities the power to jail anybody who tries to give money to Medusa or to jail anybody [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=167.76s)]
*  even who agrees to talk to them for an interview. Given this, it is unclear how Medusa will continue [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=173.2s)]
*  to do their work. They say they will keep trying. They say they will keep trying and then some. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=180.24s)]
*  Medusa's staff just issued this public letter to their readers. I just want to read it to you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=185.36s)]
*  I just want to read you part of it. They say, quote, we'd like to tell you that our new [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  undesirable status doesn't worry us that it means nothing, but that would be untrue. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  We are afraid. We fear for our readers and for those who have collaborated with Medusa for many [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=199.2s)]
*  years. We fear for our loved ones and our friends, but we believe in what we do. We believe in free [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=203.76s)]
*  speech and we believe in a democratic Russia. The greater the pressure against us and our values, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=209.12s)]
*  the harder we will resist. Medusa.io. You can find them online right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=215.04s)]
*  We don't know how long they'll be there, but they're fighting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=227.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eefoJ5eYaY&t=245.04s)]
