# Jan. 6 Committee's Presentation Of Facts Is Tacit Criminal Referral; DOJ Is Watching
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8)
*  I mean, there's a combination of Italians, the Germans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, different things have been floating around as to who was involved. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=4.4s)]
*  I mean, Yugo Chavez in Venezuela, she has an affidavit from somebody who says they wrote [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=8.08s)]
*  a software in, something with the Philippines, just all over the radar. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=12.72s)]
*  I thought the Dominion stuff was—I never saw any evidence whatsoever to sustain those [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=17.28s)]
*  allegations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=23.28s)]
*  What they were proposing, I thought, was nuts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=24.28s)]
*  You know, the theory was also completely nuts, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=28.32s)]
*  That's Trump White House lawyer Eric Hirschman, part of his deposition testimony to the January [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=33.28s)]
*  6th investigation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=37.92s)]
*  You can tell he's a Trump lawyer because he's got a baseball bat on the wall behind [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=39.04s)]
*  him that says, justice on it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=43.68s)]
*  That's exactly the kind of hot sauce Trump likes in a lawyer, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=45.44s)]
*  But in this case, he's not defending Trump anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=49.44s)]
*  He's not saying, impeach Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  No, go back in time and impeach Obama. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=53.28s)]
*  This time, this time, he's taking apart what he depicts to the January 6th investigators [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=56.32s)]
*  as just the stupidity in his characterization of some of the far-fetched claims of supposed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=63.12s)]
*  fraud that the president wanted to use as the excuse for overthrowing the U.S. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=68.88s)]
*  government. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=73.52s)]
*  That testimony that we just saw there, that I just played here moments ago, we saw that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  testimony from him before today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=79.2s)]
*  But then this evening, the January 6th investigators released a new taped statement from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=81.52s)]
*  Republican Vice Chair Liz Cheney, and she included at the end of her statement something else [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=86.32s)]
*  from Trump lawyer Eric Hirschman to get us ready for what's coming next from the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=91.84s)]
*  investigation's next hearing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  In our next hearing on Thursday, the select committee will examine President Trump's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=100.64s)]
*  relentless effort on January 6th and in the days beforehand to pressure Vice President [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=104.8s)]
*  Pence to refuse to count lawful electoral votes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=110.64s)]
*  As a federal judge has indicated, this likely violated two federal criminal statutes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=114.56s)]
*  President Trump had no factual basis for what he was doing, and he had been told it was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=120.72s)]
*  illegal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=125.76s)]
*  Despite this, President Trump plotted with a lawyer named John Eastman and others to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  overturn the outcome of the election on January 6th. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=132.8s)]
*  To give you a sense of the gravity of these issues, here is a clip of one of President [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=136.56s)]
*  Trump's own White House lawyers, Eric Hirschman, who talks to Mr. Eastman the day after [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=147.44s)]
*  It was the day after. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=149.76s)]
*  Eastman, I don't remember why he called me, or he texted me or called me, wanted to talk [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=154.48s)]
*  with me, and he said he couldn't reach others. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  And he started to ask me about something dealing with Georgia and preserving something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=165.6s)]
*  potentially for appeal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=171.76s)]
*  And I said to him, are you out of your f-ing mind? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=175.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=184.0s)]
*  I said I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=184.88s)]
*  Orderly transition. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  And he said I don't want to hear any other f-ing words coming out of your mouth no matter [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=191.92s)]
*  what. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=197.2s)]
*  Other than orderly transition, repeat those words to me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  And I eventually said orderly transition. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  I said good, John, now I'm going to give you the best free legal advice you're ever getting [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  in your life. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  Get a great f-ing criminal defense lawyer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=214.72s)]
*  And then I hung up on him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=216.72s)]
*  That was released tonight by the January 6th investigation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=218.56s)]
*  Get a great f-ing criminal defense lawyer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=226.72s)]
*  And then I hung up on him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=227.6s)]
*  This is the best free legal advice you're ever getting in your life. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=229.12s)]
*  Note to self, you like to hire bombastic lawyers who talk like this when they defend you? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=235.12s)]
*  Well, they're also going to talk like that when they decide they're not going to defend [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  you anymore because now they've come to believe you're part of a criminal enterprise [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=243.92s)]
*  and they're willing to testify about that under oath. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=247.2s)]
*  The substance of what Mr. Hirschman is sort of blustering at here, though, with a bat over [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=252.32s)]
*  his shoulder to, you know, send home the point. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=257.44s)]
*  The substance of what he's blustering at is a real thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=260.64s)]
*  I mean, John Eastman was another of this illustrious pantheon of Trump lawyers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=263.36s)]
*  He really knows how to pick them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  And Eastman has been litigating in federal court against subpoenas that he's received [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=270.88s)]
*  from the January 6 investigation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=275.84s)]
*  And he has said in his litigation that he was acting as an attorney to President Trump. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=277.84s)]
*  And there's such a thing as attorney-client privilege. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=282.4s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=284.96s)]
*  It says prosecutors basically aren't allowed to see communications that happen between [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=286.0s)]
*  a person and their lawyer. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=290.08s)]
*  A person is entitled to confidential legal advice that you can keep secret from the government, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=291.44s)]
*  even in the face of a subpoena. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=296.64s)]
*  That said, the attorney-client privilege is not limitless. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=298.64s)]
*  And in the case of Trump and this lawyer, John Eastman, in the litigation where Eastman's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=303.6s)]
*  trying to keep his communications and his documents secret, keep them away from investigators, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  a federal judge has now ruled twice in recent weeks that Eastman actually has to hand over [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=314.16s)]
*  these communications and documents to the investigation, even though he was acting as [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=319.92s)]
*  Trump's lawyer. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=324.16s)]
*  Because even though there is such a thing as attorney-client privilege, you can't use it to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=324.72s)]
*  cover up a crime. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=329.68s)]
*  You can't use it to keep secret the evidence that a lawyer and a client were actually planning [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=331.36s)]
*  crimes together. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  And a judge has ruled already that Trump and Eastman were making forth with the criming. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  And therefore, Eastman has to hand over his documents and communications because crime, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  because there is a crime fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=357.12s)]
*  The judge believes that that is likely implicated in this case, that they were plotting a crime [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=361.6s)]
*  together, and therefore his documents and communications have to be handed over to the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  investigation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is a very substantive thing for a federal judge to conclude. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=372.88s)]
*  And that is why Eric Hirschman, in classic Trump lawyer language, told the other Trump lawyer, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=376.8s)]
*  that he was going to give him the best free legal advice you're ever getting in your life. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=383.44s)]
*  Get a great effing criminal defense lawyer. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=387.04s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  And then I hung up. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=389.68s)]
*  That's why you're getting that between Trump lawyers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  And that also is what Liz Cheney was getting at in this little part of her intro there, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  in this specific part of it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=400.16s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead and read this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=412.56s)]
*  Trump's effort on January 6th and the days beforehand to pressure Vice President Pence [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=420.72s)]
*  that he should refuse to count the electoral votes likely violated two federal criminal [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  statutes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=432.16s)]
*  That is Liz Cheney saying that per a federal judge's ruling, President Trump and his lawyer, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  John Eastman, likely violated two federal laws when they pressured Mike Pence the way [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=438.24s)]
*  that they did. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=443.52s)]
*  And what she's specifically describing, you can check it in the judge's ruling, are these [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=444.16s)]
*  two federal statutes, 18 U.S. Code section 1512C and 18 U.S. Code section 371. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  In plain English, that's obstruction of an official proceeding and it's conspiracy to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=456.72s)]
*  defraud the United States. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=461.44s)]
*  And you know, there's been all this talk in the last, I don't mean, I hate people in the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=463.68s)]
*  media doing media criticism, but I'm just going to say this because I feel like this is an issue [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=471.04s)]
*  that kind of needs a little bit of offense put around it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=475.04s)]
*  It's kind of becoming, getting blown up into a bigger deal than it actually is. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=476.96s)]
*  There's been all this talk over the past few months, but particularly in the past couple [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=481.36s)]
*  of days about whether or not the January 6th investigation, at the end of their investigation, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Fp4f_L5q8&t=484.71999999999997s)]
