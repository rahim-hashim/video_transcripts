**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA)
*  Meanwhile, the former president, President Trump, today, he saw shares in his new media [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=0.0s)]
*  company swirl down the toilet when the company had to announce in a regulatory filing that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=5.86s)]
*  its entire board of directors just got served with federal grand jury subpoenas from SDNY, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=10.74s)]
*  from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=16.14s)]
*  It had previously been known that Trump's new media business venture was being investigated [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=18.48s)]
*  by the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and by an entity called FINRA, which is a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=23.56s)]
*  financial industry watchdog. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=28.44s)]
*  But now apparently it's federal prosecutors as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=30.84s)]
*  So maybe that's a criminal investigation now? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=33.92s)]
*  I mean, if you're trying to keep up, I think this is everything, but maybe there's more. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  Just off the top of my head, the former president is facing state criminal investigators in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=43.36s)]
*  Georgia, an investigation there related to his effort to overthrow the government and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=47.84s)]
*  stay in power. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Also, a state civil investigation in New York related to alleged fraud in his family business. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  His family business has already been criminally indicted as well in New York. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=58.48s)]
*  His new media business may also now be under federal criminal investigation, per these [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=63.08s)]
*  brand new subpoenas that just went out. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=67.56s)]
*  One of his loyalist lawyers at the Justice Department who allegedly helped with his overthrow [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=69.84s)]
*  the government plot, he just had a search warrant executed at his home. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=73.6s)]
*  One of his outside lawyers who also allegedly helped with the overthrow of the government [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=77.24s)]
*  plot just had a search warrant executed for his phone. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=80.52s)]
*  I mean, this is fine, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  This is normal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=87.04s)]
*  There's eight states having primaries and runoff elections tomorrow, and it is amazing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=88.96s)]
*  at a very basic level that people are still concerning themselves with the potency of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=93.04s)]
*  endorsements in some of those races from that guy who I just described. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=96.92s)]
*  I mean, we're trying to figure out if even his lawyers are potentially going to jail, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=101.24s)]
*  and he's the most important figure in Republican Party politics still? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=107.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjB_fpktAA&t=114.24000000000001s)]
