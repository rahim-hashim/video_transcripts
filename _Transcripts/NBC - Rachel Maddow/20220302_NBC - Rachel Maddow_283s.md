# Putin's Shambolic Invasion No Less Traumatizing For Fleeing Ukrainians
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I)
*  It seems clear the Russians are now targeting residential areas, or they are shelling indiscriminately. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=0.0s)]
*  Either way, it is civilians that are now caught in the middle. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=5.44s)]
*  This weekend, we heard from a Russian general who said maybe they would create a humanitarian [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=8.72s)]
*  corridor leading from the city. And when people heard that here, it just sent chills up their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=12.96s)]
*  spines. It's not just what happened in Grozny in 1994, but also what happened in Syria. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  The Russians bombed and targeted hospitals across Syria. And so the model is there, and people here [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=23.28s)]
*  are aware of that. And they were kind of waiting for this next phase of the war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=28.64s)]
*  There was initially in the last week, maybe a thinking that Ukrainian forces and the civilian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=31.68s)]
*  defense forces had stood their ground. Now, I think we're starting to enter into this period [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=35.68s)]
*  where people are starting to realistically think that the Russians are not stopping. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=39.92s)]
*  They continue to move on these cities, and it doesn't seem like they are going to stop [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=43.44s)]
*  or pause or turn around. And the shelling is concerning everybody. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=47.84s)]
*  Yeah. And so with that shelling, Cal, Ukrainian refugees are telling you, I understand, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=50.88s)]
*  that Russians are attacking residential areas. Others are reporting that as well. We have seen [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=55.36s)]
*  some photos and videos suggesting that. How is that changing the situation where you are? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=59.6s)]
*  You said it was giving people chills to hear of a potential humanitarian corridor. But what has it [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=65.68s)]
*  meant in terms of the influx of people and the fear that people have as they get to safer parts [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=70.24s)]
*  of the country in Lviv? So we're seeing people arrive in this city completely traumatized. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=75.44s)]
*  Just gripped with fear. They've just come from a hellish place where they were dealing with bombs [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=83.84s)]
*  and trying to get their families out. And then they come here to Lviv, a place that was supposed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=88.8s)]
*  to be safe. We've had five separate air raid sirens go off today throughout the day. And so [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=92.08s)]
*  you see people scrambling to these shelters. I'm 350 miles from Kiev. We have not heard jets [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=96.88s)]
*  at all. We haven't been hit once here. But people are so traumatized, they're so scarred by what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=103.28s)]
*  they've seen, that they go sprinting to those bomb shelters and they have nothing with them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=107.92s)]
*  Nobody chooses to be a refugee. It's a thing that happens to you and happens in an instant. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=112.08s)]
*  You have 10 minutes to get whatever you can carry and leave your home. And the majority of refugees [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=116.24s)]
*  never go back to their homes. They end up raising their families in foreign countries. They end up [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=120.16s)]
*  living their lives in foreign countries. And Ukraine's no different. We have a generation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=124.64s)]
*  that is going to be scarred. You have a million people that have already left the country. Most [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=130.72s)]
*  of those folks will never come back. The cities will never be the same. And I'm trying to paint [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=134.32s)]
*  a picture here of how Vladimir Putin can destabilize a country without even really holding [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=137.92s)]
*  on to it. If his goal is to destabilize it, make this an unlivable place, take out the government [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=143.2s)]
*  and replace it, that's still quite possible. People here are fleeing for their lives and those who [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=147.76s)]
*  don't want to stay and fight are just trying to get out. Military age males between 18 and 60 [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=153.2s)]
*  are now forced to stay and fight. And as more and more civilians pick up weapons, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  civilians become soldiers and soldiers are dying. And that's the reality of what's happening here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=161.76s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit, Kal, about, and you just mentioned about a million have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=166.56s)]
*  fled already. A million people have fled already since the conflict began. Talk to me [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=170.24s)]
*  about how the authorities are managing that exodus, the flow of people both on the Ukrainian [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=174.4s)]
*  side and in the neighboring countries from what you've been able to gather. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=180.56s)]
*  The Ukrainians are reeling from this. I mean, look, just over a week ago, Ukrainian government [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=185.68s)]
*  was saying that there was likely not going to be an invasion. They were disagreeing with [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=190.08s)]
*  Washington's intelligence. And there was clearly an effort on behalf of the government not to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=193.92s)]
*  spook people. They didn't want to run on the banks. They didn't want the refugee crisis to start [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=198.64s)]
*  without a war actually starting. And so they didn't put in the preparations that they otherwise would [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=202.64s)]
*  have put in because they didn't want to raise alarm. And so here we are a week later, the train [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=207.04s)]
*  stations are being overrun. People are sleeping in the train stations. They're sleeping outside [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=211.44s)]
*  the train stations here in Lviv. The city is literally bursting at the seams. The restaurants [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=214.88s)]
*  are running out of food. It's becoming a more and more difficult situation. And then at the border, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=218.64s)]
*  it's even worse. I'm 50 miles from the Polish border and the backup of cars runs about halfway [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=223.04s)]
*  here. More than 20 miles long. People are abandoning their cars. They're leaving their [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  things behind. They're trying to walk to the border. Now, when you reach Poland, if you're lucky enough [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=231.2s)]
*  to reach the Polish border, Poland has gotten rid of their visa requirements, saying anybody from [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine can remain in Poland for up to three months. That's according to the European Union. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  They're talking about extending that, but that's going to be a long bureaucratic process. And even [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  still, you're with your family, none of your belongings in Poland. It's becoming a disaster. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=249.68s)]
*  All right. NBC News is Cal Perry live for us from Lviv. Cal, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuU2tiGo09I&t=256.48s)]
