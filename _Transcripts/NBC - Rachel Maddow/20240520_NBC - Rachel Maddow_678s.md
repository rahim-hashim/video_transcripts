# ‘Discursive, sprawling, uninteresting’: What Rachel Maddow saw inside the Trump trial today
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU)
*  And I want to bring in MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, host of, of course, The Rachel Maddow Show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=0.0s)]
*  She was inside the courtroom today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=5.32s)]
*  Rachel, describe the experience there and how, if you could see, Trump or the jury, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=7.24s)]
*  either. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=13.56s)]
*  This whole argument with Michael Cohen on the stand and the cross-examination, which [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=14.56s)]
*  seemed pretty tough, and then the redirect, which was cleaning a lot up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=18.8s)]
*  Yeah, Andrea, it was a really, really interesting day for a lot of different reasons. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  First of all, from a personal perspective, I felt very lucky that I had a great vantage [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=29.88s)]
*  point of the entire jury and also of Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=34.16s)]
*  There's some police officers that sometimes get in the way of all of this in the courtroom [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=37.56s)]
*  seeing Trump, but I could see them both pretty much entirely for most of the day, which was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=40.76s)]
*  interesting because one of the things I don't think I was able to appreciate before was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  the sort of palpable interest level of the jury. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=50.8s)]
*  And today we saw the switch from the end of the cross-examination of Michael Cohen, that's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=54.96s)]
*  being conducted by Todd Blanch, Trump's defense counsel, to the start of the redirect, meaning [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=59.02s)]
*  the prosecutor is going back to Cohen and giving him more open-ended questions, letting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  him explain himself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=68.54s)]
*  I think while Todd Blanch was very animated and at times very agitated today, he really [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  yelled at Michael Cohen a few different times, the jury didn't seem to be following him all [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=75.34s)]
*  that tightly. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=82.34s)]
*  I noticed several jurors kind of yawning or staring off in the middle distance, kind of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=83.34s)]
*  maybe not knowing what he was getting at. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=87.38000000000001s)]
*  He seemed to be trying to compensate for that by putting some emotion into it, but I just [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  don't know that it made it more coherent. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=92.78s)]
*  When Susan Hoffinger took over the prosecutor, her redirect had a lot of pace and it was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=95.4s)]
*  very punchy and she was basically saying, Michael Cohen, you were asked about this, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=102.34s)]
*  explain what you meant, you were asked about this, explain what you meant, you were asked [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=109.06s)]
*  about this, explain what you meant, essentially trying to obviate any points that the defense [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=111.42s)]
*  might have been able to put on the board with this very aggressive cross-examination of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=116.68s)]
*  Michael Cohen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=123.68s)]
*  So it's been a really interesting day. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=124.68s)]
*  Trump has definitely seemed to be asleep for parts of it, but awake for others and sending [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=128.08s)]
*  notes back and forth with his lawyer. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=133.76s)]
*  The jury has been sort of on and off in terms of their attention, but I think that Mr. Blanch [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=135.6s)]
*  is, I would guess, I think the best case for the defense is that he's setting himself up [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  for a brilliant summation, but whether or not the cross-examination is telling its own [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=145.88s)]
*  story I think is harder to say. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=150.2s)]
*  Rachel, I'm curious because I was in the overflow room and even though I have a dead-on view [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=153.56s)]
*  of Donald Trump, I don't see the jury. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  I have a dead-on view of Michael Cohen, but I don't see the jury. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  So I'll ask you a couple of questions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  One is, when Michael Cohen came in, just the way they both moved, it seemed like for a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=166.76s)]
*  Donald Trump at least looked at him or referred to him, although most of the time, again, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=171.8s)]
*  looking at that head-on shot, he had his eyes closed a lot today when he wasn't talking [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=177.48s)]
*  directly to his lawyers or whatever. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=181.68s)]
*  And also, we've talked a lot here on this program about the jury and how sometimes Michael [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=184.98s)]
*  Cohen seemed to be speaking directly to them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=191.86s)]
*  And so I'm curious about the interaction between Trump and Cohen, but also between [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=194.44s)]
*  Cohen and his jury. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=199.5s)]
*  Yeah, from where I am sitting, I can't see much interaction between Trump and Cohen, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=201.5s)]
*  and I can see them both individually. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=209.5s)]
*  It's possible that there's some dynamic happening between them, but it sort of seems like they're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=211.5s)]
*  each in their own little world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=219.06s)]
*  I don't sense a lot of eye contact or anything going on between the two of them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  Michael Cohen, when he's being closely questioned by Blanche and then in a very different tone, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=226.86s)]
*  but also closely questioned by the prosecutor on redirect, he's focused intently, I think, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  as you would have to be on those questions, because obviously in the case of Todd Blanche, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  he's trying to trip him up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=242.58s)]
*  You have to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=243.58s)]
*  But any time that Michael Cohen has a little bit of breathing room, an answer where he [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=245.3s)]
*  gets a little bit of time to explain himself and expound on something, he does direct his [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=248.78000000000003s)]
*  energy to the jury, and they are watching him very closely. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=253.74s)]
*  So, you know, I, yeah, sorry, go ahead. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=257.06s)]
*  No, I was wondering when I was there last week, I noticed that when the jury walked [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=260.62s)]
*  in, Rachel, they never looked at Donald Trump like to a person. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=264.14s)]
*  They would walk in, look ahead of themselves, and the second they passed Trump, they'd look [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  down. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=271.5s)]
*  What did you get when they were filing in and out and their interaction with the former [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=272.5s)]
*  president? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  It seems like they are there, you know, to do the people's business, and they are taking [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=281.42s)]
*  this seriously and they're focused and they're not sort of playing reindeer games in terms [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=287.06s)]
*  of anybody staring anybody down in the courtroom. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  And honestly, nobody is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  I think this jury is being taxed in terms of their ability to sustain interest in what [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=296.06s)]
*  often feels like arcane and plotless, not badgering, but sort of pecking at the witness [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=302.94s)]
*  in the case of Michael Cohen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=309.38s)]
*  If you don't know why it matters, if it's not obvious, I think, to a layman why it would [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=312.26s)]
*  matter, you know, whether or not Trump was, whether or not Michael Cohen had 12 closer [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=315.94s)]
*  to 12 calls or closer to 20 calls with AT&T in 2017, then hearing the 11th question on [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=322.26s)]
*  that point, it is taxing in terms of focusing. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=329.58s)]
*  And you can see jurors, I mean, nobody's doing anything performative or theatrical, but you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=332.5s)]
*  can see jurors kind of doing this, you know, or kind of looking out into the room or trying [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=337.26s)]
*  to find something else to keep their attention while Trump's defense counsel is trying to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=341.98s)]
*  pound away at Cohen. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=347.9s)]
*  So there was, I mean, they did try to build to a little bit of a dramatic crescendo at [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=348.9s)]
*  the very end of the cross-examination. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=352.06s)]
*  I think it was a big missed, a missed punch, basically. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=354.18s)]
*  Blanche basically trying to get Cohen to admit that he had a financial interest in this case. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  And Cohen, I think, very strongly parried that and said, yes, I have a financial interest [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  in this case because I talk about this case on my podcast and on TikTok, and that's how [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  I get paid. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=374.54s)]
*  Do I have a financial interest in whether or not he gets convicted? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=375.54s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=378.26s)]
*  And frankly, it's probably better for me if he doesn't, because then I can keep talking [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=379.58000000000004s)]
*  about it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=382.38s)]
*  And I think Blanche thought that he had really backed Cohen into some sort of embarrassing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=383.38s)]
*  admission by saying he had a financial interest. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=386.88s)]
*  And Cohen answered in a way that was both plausible, that was true to the sort of character [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=389.62s)]
*  that he's shown himself to be in front of this jury, and that also completely obviated [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=393.76s)]
*  Blanche's point and landed really in Cohen's favor at the end of that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=398.64s)]
*  So they were trying to build for some drama, but I think Cohen essentially outfoxed them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=402.48s)]
*  I don't know if that backs up the impression we have from reading this narration that is [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=406.64s)]
*  being written by our great colleagues in the overflow room. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  And in reading it, you don't have the affect. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  But it certainly seems with a few exceptions today and most notably on Thursday, that it's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=419.28s)]
*  very discursive cross-examination, that it's going here, there, there's no narrative thread, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  and it just seems that you're not building a story for the jury of what happened. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=430.67999999999995s)]
*  I don't know if that was your impression as well. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Andrea, I think that's right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's what I mean by, you know, I think the best interpretation of what's happening [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=443.4s)]
*  on the defense is that they may be building toward a brilliant summation. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=446.92s)]
*  So I don't know if you ever watch like the Great British Baking Show or like any of those [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=451.24s)]
*  other baking shows, but like they're handed a bunch of different ingredients and you have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=455.32s)]
*  no idea what they're going to make. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=459.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=461.0s)]
*  But you know, they've got all these ingredients out on the bench and you don't exactly know [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=462.0s)]
*  what they're going to make. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  And at the end of it, it's like some beautiful French patisserie thing, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=470.1s)]
*  Maybe this is going to come together as some amazing recipe in the summation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=473.56s)]
*  But as it has been presented thus far, the cross-examination of Michael Cohen thus far [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=476.88s)]
*  is the defense's case. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  And it is thus far a splatter painting of stuff that does not connect or tell a narrative. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=484.08s)]
*  And they don't need to tell a narrative. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=489.68s)]
*  They don't need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any counter explanation for the events [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=491.2s)]
*  that are at issue in this case. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  They just need to poke holes in the prosecution's case. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=498.6s)]
*  But they do need to hold the jury's interest and seem like they are taking up the jury's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=501.04s)]
*  time for a reason. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  And there are very few moments at which I think Todd Blanch in this defense is saying [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=506.92s)]
*  a thing that seems to mean a thing to this jury. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=511.12s)]
*  He may do the world's greatest or the defense team may do the world's greatest summation [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=514.68s)]
*  that brings it all together in some way that's unforeseeable from this point. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=518.56s)]
*  But in the moment, it is discursive, sprawling and uninteresting. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=522.0s)]
*  So the jury is the last group to come into the courtroom. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=526.42s)]
*  Everybody is already seated and then they rise from when the jury comes in. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=530.24s)]
*  I wonder if you got any sense of whether they looked over to the people that were accompanying [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=533.52s)]
*  Donald Trump to the to the courthouse today. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=538.6s)]
*  Any glances over at, I don't know, Alan Dershowitz and company? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=542.16s)]
*  You're definitely seeing you're seeing a lot of I would say you're I noticed jurors looking [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=549.96s)]
*  out into the courtroom in general, whether or not they were focusing on Trump's entourage [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=558.04s)]
*  is hard to tell. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=564.0s)]
*  I will say just as an observer in the courtroom, the entourage today is colorful. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=565.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=569.16s)]
*  The Hells Angels leader has a is a very large man wearing a very flamboyant suit with a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=570.16s)]
*  big dyed black pompadour and huge gaudy jewelry on very large hands. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=579.52s)]
*  He's sitting next to Boris Epstein, who kind of looks like his body double. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=588.36s)]
*  And there's Alan Dershowitz and there's other recognizable people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=592.88s)]
*  And there's a bunch of members of Congress and well-known lawyers. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  And everybody seems sort of there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=599.56s)]
*  There is a sort of performative aspect of the way that they're behaving in court. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=603.8s)]
*  It is very noticeable for those of us who are there observing as journalists. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=607.4s)]
*  But I don't know if they're catching the jury's attention so much. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a it's a it's a little it's not a Star Wars bar scene, but it's a it's a little bit [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=615.24s)]
*  of a cast of characters. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=620.2s)]
*  Not to mention Bernie Carrick as well. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=622.72s)]
*  Rachel Maddow, really good to have you. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=625.88s)]

*  I thank you for that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=631.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm really changed my mood. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=632.2s)]
*  You're appreciated. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=634.4s)]
*  It's as well as soggy bottoms. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=635.4s)]
*  No soggy bottoms. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=637.68s)]
*  So make Mary Berry very upset. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTS0xzm1pmU&t=639.96s)]
