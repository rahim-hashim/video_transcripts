# Trump cuts communication from health agencies despite growing bird flu threat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE)
*  You know what else isn't a popular idea? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=0.0s)]
*  Bird flu. Bird flu. Today in Long Island, New York, a duck farm that has been in operation since 1908 [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=2.6s)]
*  shut down, they had to shut down to start the process of euthanizing their entire flock of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=10.44s)]
*  100,000 ducks. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=17.52s)]
*  Because at that farm in Long Island, New York, they've got a confirmed outbreak of bird flu. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=19.32s)]
*  And [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=24.720000000000002s)]
*  bird flu has now killed more than 130 million birds in the United States, in all 50 states. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=25.96s)]
*  In 28 states, they're now testing their dairy cows for it as well, because it has jumped from birds to cows. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=33.6s)]
*  Which means one of the risk factors they're now alerting people to for this thing is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=42.36s)]
*  consumption of or contact with raw milk. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=47.52s)]
*  It's a risk factor now for bird flu. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=51.52s)]
*  Nearly 70 people in the United States have been infected with bird flu thus far. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=54.88s)]
*  We've even had deaths of people's pet cats, because the cats have drunk raw milk meant for human consumption. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=58.96s)]
*  The raw milk was from cows infected with bird flu. It gave the cats bird flu, and then the cats died. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=66.58s)]
*  Because of all that very bad and now very fast-moving news about this new epidemic, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=75.52s)]
*  the CDC just sent urgent guidance to American hospitals, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=81.2s)]
*  advising hospitals that when people appear at the hospital with flu this flu season, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=85.68s)]
*  people shouldn't just be tested for normal flu. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  They need to be tested for bird flu as well, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  because that needs to be handled differently. And anybody who tests positive for bird flu needs to be separated from other patients. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  Hospital staff need to know about it in order to wear appropriate protective clothing to protect themselves. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=101.76s)]
*  I say the CDC just sent that urgent advice to American hospitals, but when I say they just sent it, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=106.96s)]
*  what I mean specifically is they sent that advice last week. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  While President Biden was still president, because now that President Trump is president, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=120.8s)]
*  he has ordered that the CDC and all US health agencies should no longer release any information to anyone on anything. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=125.96s)]
*  Not just to the public, but to scientists and doctors and hospitals. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=135.16s)]
*  And that includes the CDC's flagship health alert publication for doctors and scientists called MMWR, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=140.2s)]
*  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=146.6s)]
*  This week, CDC was scheduled to publish several MMWR reports, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=149.04s)]
*  including three about this burgeoning bird flu outbreak that is happening and rapidly progressing right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=153.16s)]
*  Those alerts, those MMWRs are not going out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=160.76s)]
*  They were as of last week. And what was going out as of last week was alarming. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=164.0s)]
*  As of this week with Trump in charge, no, he has ordered that all information be stopped, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  including scientific information to advise hospitals on how to deal with this emerging epidemic. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=173.88s)]
*  Is that popular? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=183.72s)]
*  Is that a good idea? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=186.76s)]
*  Is that a good idea? Is that perceived as a popular idea among the American people? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Is that what you thought you were voting for? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  You may have noticed recently at the grocery store, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  you might have even noticed new headlines recently about the price of eggs really jerking suddenly upward right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Average egg prices have just shot up to nearly 40% higher than they were this time last year. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=207.8s)]
*  That's not generic inflation that specifically because of bird flu. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=213.72s)]
*  But all communications and instructions and data and information about trying to contend with bird flu, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=221.72s)]
*  all of that has been shut down on Trump's orders. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=227.72s)]
*  So when he says, oh, the last election was all about the price of eggs, I'm pretty sure this isn't what he meant. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=233.24s)]
*  But that's what we're getting now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=239.48s)]
*  While meanwhile, Trump's nominee to run health and human services for the U.S. government [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=241.4s)]
*  reportedly approached one of the nation's largest raw milk producers, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=246.68s)]
*  asking him to please become an advisor to the FDA in Washington. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=252.28s)]
*  This is a man whose company has been the subject of at least 11 different lawsuits [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=256.2s)]
*  stemming from contamination of his raw milk products. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=259.8s)]
*  This farmer has also been the subject of 13 recalls, including [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  and, yes, bird flu in his raw milk. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=267.0s)]
*  His products are currently barred from sale in California for making so many people sick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=270.2s)]
*  One Salmonella outbreak his company is being sued for resulted in 171 people being sickened, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=275.4s)]
*  including some people who got kidney failure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=280.76s)]
*  Now we are in the midst of the most serious outbreak of bird flu, which is the outbreak of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=285.0s)]
*  the coronavirus, and it's been the most serious outbreak of the coronavirus in the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=289.23999999999995s)]
*  Now we are in the midst of the most serious outbreak of bird flu we have ever had as a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=293.88s)]
*  country, one that is rapidly growing and affects multiple species, including now humans. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  It is not infecting just birds, but cats and people and cows. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=303.4s)]
*  This is an epidemic where the CDC is advising hospitals how to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=308.84s)]
*  deal with people coming in with flu, making sure they're tested for it, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=312.28s)]
*  telling hospitals how they can protect patients and protect their own health workers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=316.12s)]
*  The CDC is warning that raw milk from an infected cow, not only just drinking it, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=320.20000000000005s)]
*  but potentially even just being splashed in the face with it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, they're saying contact with raw milk from an infected cow is one of the ways people can be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  exposed to this emerging epidemic of bird flu. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=335.08000000000004s)]
*  And while that is how the last administration was trying to get their arms around this emerging [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=340.68s)]
*  threat as recently as the end of last week, this new administration this week says, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=344.68s)]
*  first of all, let's get the raw milk people here to Washington to advise the FDA, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  presumably on all the benefits of raw milk. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=354.04s)]
*  And in the meantime, stop releasing any information on this bird flu thing, anything. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=356.36s)]
*  Honestly, it sounds scary. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=360.68s)]
*  Maybe if we don't talk about it, maybe it'll go away. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=362.76s)]
*  And by the way, pay no attention to the price of eggs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdIzcRvpAFE&t=365.96000000000004s)]
