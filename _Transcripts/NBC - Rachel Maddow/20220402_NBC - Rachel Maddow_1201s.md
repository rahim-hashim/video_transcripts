# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 1
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4)
*  But no shortage of news this week concerning January 6. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night on this broadcast, we discussed new reporting [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  that the Justice Department has substantially [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  widened its investigation to look beyond those who physically [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=9.02s)]
*  breached the Capitol that day to the broader effort [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=13.0s)]
*  to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=15.84s)]
*  We know the committee's been looking into that, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=17.38s)]
*  but now the Justice Department is. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=19.46s)]
*  Well, tonight we've got some breaking news [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=20.96s)]
*  about the investigation into January 6 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=22.62s)]
*  and the former president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  CNN is reporting that the White House [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=26.64s)]
*  diarist, who's in charge of compiling presidential records, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=28.72s)]
*  recently testified before the January 6 committee [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=32.16s)]
*  and said that the Trump White House started [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  sharing less information about his activities in the days [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=38.16s)]
*  directly preceding the riot. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=42.16s)]
*  Now, this is according to two sources [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=44.76s)]
*  with knowledge of the probe. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=46.68s)]
*  I should note, NBC has not yet confirmed this reporting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=48.16s)]
*  And if you're wondering, what is a White House diarist, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=51.56s)]
*  you're probably not alone. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=55.2s)]
*  Every presidential administration [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=56.74s)]
*  has an official called a diarist whose job [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=58.38s)]
*  is to keep a running list of the president's meetings, phone [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=61.08s)]
*  calls, and activities for posterity. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=63.92s)]
*  The diarist works with top White House staff [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=66.58s)]
*  to create this record, which is compiled monthly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=68.88s)]
*  Now, CNN also reports that other witnesses have told [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=72.34s)]
*  the committee that there was significantly less information [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=75.04s)]
*  being shared with those involved in White House record [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=78.26s)]
*  keeping during the same time period, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=82.1s)]
*  with one source telling CNN that, quote, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=84.34s)]
*  White House record keepers appeared [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=86.22s)]
*  to be iced out in the days leading up to January 6, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=88.38000000000001s)]
*  end quote. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=91.86s)]
*  Joining us now is the former United States [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=92.86s)]
*  attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Barbara [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=94.58s)]
*  McQuaid. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=96.94s)]
*  Barbara, thanks for being here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=97.78s)]
*  We have a lot to talk about here, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=98.94s)]
*  but I want to just focus on this diarist for a second. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=100.4s)]
*  These things are not just for posterity. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=104.34s)]
*  There are requirements, particularly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=106.78s)]
*  with the National Archives, about the type of record [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  keeping that the White House is supposed to keep, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=110.62s)]
*  which is why we're all worried about those several hours [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=112.7s)]
*  of phone calls that are missing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=115.22s)]
*  This is abnormal, to say the least. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  It's abnormal and also violates the Presidential Records Act, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=120.42s)]
*  Ali. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=123.54s)]
*  There is law passed after Watergate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=124.3s)]
*  for the very purpose of memorializing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=126.62s)]
*  what the president does, where he goes, who he talks to, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  who comes to visit him at the White House. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=132.26s)]
*  That is all a law. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=134.3s)]
*  And so to fail to comply with that law is a violation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=135.3s)]
*  Now, here's the rub. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=138.46s)]
*  There's no violation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=139.54s)]
*  There's no enforcement mechanism in the Presidential Records [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=140.62s)]
*  Act. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  I still think that doesn't mean that there [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=144.46s)]
*  is no consequence here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=146.38000000000002s)]
*  It could be if this was an effort to conceal crimes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=148.18s)]
*  There could be an obstruction of justice here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  Or at the very least, this is the kind of evidence [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  that prosecutors refer to as consciousness of guilt. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=155.66000000000003s)]
*  That is, I'm hiding my tracks because I [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=158.78s)]
*  knew I'm doing something wrong, and I [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=160.78s)]
*  want to make sure that it is not known to others later. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=162.5s)]
*  And of course, one of the things you and I have discussed [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=166.94s)]
*  over the years is that there's a sort of a triangulation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=169.1s)]
*  that prosecutors do, right? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=171.62s)]
*  They get a piece of information here [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=172.82s)]
*  and a piece of information there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=174.26s)]
*  So this one becomes important, that something had changed, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=176.14s)]
*  whether or not they were abiding by the law [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=179.7s)]
*  and the requirements of the Presidential Records Act, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=182.1s)]
*  something in the days before January 6, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=184.74s)]
*  according to this reporting of this diarist who [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=187.54s)]
*  has testified, changed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=189.9s)]
*  You are a quick study, Allie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=192.85999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=194.18s)]
*  And so if you can show a pattern for the first three [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=195.06s)]
*  years and many days of his administration, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=198.82s)]
*  the diarist was on the job. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=201.26s)]
*  He was getting consistent information. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=202.54s)]
*  He had access. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=204.42s)]
*  And suddenly, in the days leading up [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  to this insurrection at the White House, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=207.06s)]
*  he gets squeezed out and frozen out. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=208.82s)]
*  Is there something they didn't want him to see? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  And so we don't know the answer to that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=212.54s)]
*  The other possibility is dysfunction [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=214.26s)]
*  had taken over the White House as people [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=216.18s)]
*  were jumping ship in the waning days of an administration. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=217.82s)]
*  But I think at least it raises some questions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=220.78s)]
*  Why was it that the diarist was not [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=222.9s)]
*  being given the same access that he [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  had had for all of those years before in the Trump [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=225.9s)]
*  administration? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=228.3s)]
*  Belgarod is 25 miles north of Kharkiv. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=230.58s)]
*  It's on the other side of the country [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=233.34s)]
*  from where I am standing tonight. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  It's only about an hour's drive away [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=236.94s)]
*  from Ukraine's second largest city, that is Kharkiv. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  Look at what happened in the Russian city of Belgarod today. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=242.5s)]
*  Take a look at these missiles coming out of the sky [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=245.78s)]
*  and those helicopters flying really low, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=247.94s)]
*  and then what appears to be an explosion. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  This was a fuel depot inside Belgarod, inside Russia. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=253.72s)]
*  Russia immediately claimed today that Ukraine [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=258.84s)]
*  was responsible for this attack. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=260.92s)]
*  It said it was a significant escalation that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=262.36s)]
*  could complicate peace talks. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=265.64s)]
*  Ukraine refused to confirm or deny [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=267.52s)]
*  that it was responsible for the strike, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=269.56s)]
*  but NBC News has confirmed that this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=271.28s)]
*  was the handiwork of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=274.12s)]
*  is a bold move. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=278.08s)]
*  This is Ukraine's first known airstrike [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=280.0s)]
*  on Russian soil since this invasion began, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=282.36s)]
*  and it's just one item on a very long list of Ukrainian military [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=285.32s)]
*  victories in the last 24 hours. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=289.92s)]
*  The Pentagon says that the airport outside of Kiev [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=292.72s)]
*  has been abandoned by Russian forces. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=295.76s)]
*  Now, this was an incredibly important target for Russia. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=298.6s)]
*  Control of this specific airport would have allowed Russia [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=301.48s)]
*  to fly troops directly to the capital [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=305.56s)]
*  and not worry about getting stuck in the mud or roadblocks [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=308.32s)]
*  or running out of fuel, as their tanks have been doing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=311.44s)]
*  But now they've abandoned it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=315.24s)]
*  You can see it in this new satellite image [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=316.52s)]
*  from Maxar tonight. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=318.4s)]
*  If you see those big piles of dirt everywhere, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=319.4s)]
*  those are protective berms that Russia built up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=323.28s)]
*  They're earthen walls in front of their military vehicles [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=326.48s)]
*  and tanks to keep them protected. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=329.76s)]
*  Well, now Russia has rolled up and left the airport. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=332.08s)]
*  All that's left are their walls of dirt. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=334.92s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=338.28s)]
*  This was a small village east of Kharkiv today called Malarogan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=339.12s)]
*  This town was previously under Russian control, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=343.92s)]
*  but Ukrainians have now taken it back. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  As they mount a series of counterattacks [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=348.56s)]
*  across the country, Ukrainian soldiers [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=350.64s)]
*  surveyed damage to these Russian tanks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=352.68s)]
*  Another soldier found a set of Russian military documents [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=355.8s)]
*  that had somehow stayed intact in all the rubble. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=358.8s)]
*  British intelligence sources said today [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=362.44s)]
*  that Ukraine has also retaken two villages south of Chernihiv, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=364.36s)]
*  which are located along important supply routes [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=368.76s)]
*  to the nation's capital. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  And take a look at this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=373.52s)]
*  This is the Kyiv suburb of Borodnanka today. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=374.44s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers held up their blue and yellow flag [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  after Russian soldiers abandoned the city without a fight. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=380.88s)]
*  On the outskirts of Kyiv, a suburb called Buja [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=385.48s)]
*  was one of the first cities to be taken over by Russia. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=389.0s)]
*  It's been in Russian control since the end of February. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=391.36s)]
*  The mayor of Buja himself was reportedly injured last month [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=395.32s)]
*  when a city came under heavy shelling. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=399.12s)]
*  But last night on Telegram, the mayor [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=401.48s)]
*  announced his city is now free. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=402.88s)]
*  Ukraine has retaken control of Buja. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  He said the day will forever go down [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=408.4s)]
*  in the history of their town. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=410.4s)]
*  A reporter for the Kyiv Independent newspaper [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=412.68s)]
*  today said that Ukrainian soldiers are retaking cities [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=414.88s)]
*  around Kyiv at such a rapid clip that he barely has time [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  to redraw the lines on his map. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=421.96s)]
*  That same reporter said today that he believes [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  we're at an unmistakable turning point in this war. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=427.56s)]
*  What we have is another face of the war. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=431.96s)]
*  And it's just, we get it not from, you know, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=434.44s)]
*  Russian statements or something, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=437.44s)]
*  but just because of the very nature that has changed [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  over the last, let's say, a week or so. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=442.0s)]
*  This is very clear in terms of, you know, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  the Battle of Kyiv. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=447.79999999999995s)]
*  I personally believe that the Battle of Kyiv [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=449.44s)]
*  is over with the Russian defeat. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=451.28s)]
*  With Russia on the retreat all around Ukraine's capital, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=455.6s)]
*  it's a good opportunity to take stock [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=458.2s)]
*  of what Russia has lost since this invasion began. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=459.92s)]
*  US officials believe that the Russian army [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=464.0s)]
*  has already committed more than half [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=465.88s)]
*  of its total combat forces of the entire country [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=467.96s)]
*  to the war in Ukraine. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=472.0s)]
*  As many as 15,000 Russian soldiers are believed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=473.64s)]
*  to have died, including at least seven high ranking generals. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=477.44s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting today [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=481.96s)]
*  that Russia is running its military strategy out of Moscow [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=483.36s)]
*  with quote, no central war commander to call the shots, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=486.48s)]
*  end quote, which perhaps explains the haphazard nature [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=490.04s)]
*  of this invasion from one of the largest militaries [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=493.0s)]
*  on planet earth. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=496.12s)]
*  The Times reports that with the majority [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=498.2s)]
*  of their military already deployed, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=499.96s)]
*  Russia has now begun looking for reinforcements [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  outside of Russia, drafting soldiers [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=504.56s)]
*  from the nation of Georgia, bringing in mercenaries [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=507.2s)]
*  from a private military company. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=509.36s)]
*  Putin has signed a decree to call up [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  tens of thousands of conscripts. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=513.84s)]
*  The British Ministry of Defense said today [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=517.56s)]
*  that it's highly unlikely that Russia planned [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=519.36s)]
*  on tapping reinforcements this way [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=521.92s)]
*  and indicates that the scale of the losses [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=523.68s)]
*  that it has sustained during the invasion [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=525.88s)]
*  is higher than anyone expected. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=528.96s)]
*  Today we saw anti-war protests as far away [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=532.84s)]
*  as in Syria and India. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=535.52s)]
*  These protesters held up the Ukrainian flag outside [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=537.9200000000001s)]
*  of an Indian government building during a visit [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=540.2s)]
*  from Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=542.32s)]
*  India, by the way, is making no effort [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=544.76s)]
*  to distance itself from Russia, but some Indian people are. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=546.36s)]
*  In Turkey, we've seen anti-war protests all week [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=549.44s)]
*  as Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held peace talks. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=552.2800000000001s)]
*  Earlier this week in Prague, we saw several thousand [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  Russian expats protest the Russian invasion. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  But in Russia itself, if there were any protests this week, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=561.88s)]
*  we didn't hear about them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=565.04s)]
*  At the beginning of the war, Russians turned out en masse [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  to protest the war. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=568.96s)]
*  More than 15,000 protesters have been arrested to date. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=570.32s)]
*  So what's the future of the Russian opposition? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=574.64s)]
*  Is there one? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=577.12s)]
*  Well, last week, the de facto leader [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=578.4s)]
*  of Russia's opposition movement, Alexei Navalny, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=580.32s)]
*  was sentenced to nine years in a maximum security prison [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=583.08s)]
*  on ginned up charges by the Russian government. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=586.36s)]
*  Navalny founded an organization called the Anti-Corruption [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=589.36s)]
*  Foundation that put out reports and made videos documenting [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=592.44s)]
*  exactly how corruption in the Russian government [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=595.76s)]
*  was lining the pockets of Russian oligarchs [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=598.48s)]
*  and Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=601.44s)]
*  Russia's charges against Navalny were [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=603.6s)]
*  that the Anti-Corruption Foundation was somehow [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  a fraud itself and that Navalny was stealing money from it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=608.84s)]
*  And these charges were widely seen as a warning. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=613.0s)]
*  Russia's government essentially saying [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=615.96s)]
*  that if you investigate Russian corruption, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=617.56s)]
*  you will end up in a penal colony. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  After his sentencing, Navalny was [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=623.04s)]
*  allowed to make a statement to the court. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  Authorities eventually cut off the feed. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  But let me read you a translation of how he started. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=629.2399999999999s)]
*  Quote, I want to use my last words to make [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=631.5999999999999s)]
*  an official announcement for those [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=634.16s)]
*  who think that the Anti-Corruption Foundation will [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=635.64s)]
*  stop, will finish, will slow down, will fall into decay. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=638.52s)]
*  No. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=643.1199999999999s)]
*  Not only will it not stop, but the Anti-Corruption [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=644.16s)]
*  Foundation will become global. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=647.2s)]
*  We will establish an international Anti-Corruption [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  Foundation, which of course will still [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  focus on the swindlers and thieves from the Kremlin. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=655.48s)]
*  Well, over the course of the last month, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=659.96s)]
*  as the international community has levied sanctions [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=661.6s)]
*  against hundreds of Russian individuals, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  many of them are individuals whose abuses have [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=667.08s)]
*  been documented by Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  for years. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  So on the one hand, it's become significantly harder [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=674.6s)]
*  to voice opposition from inside Russia. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=676.88s)]
*  But at the same time, the Russian opposition [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=680.0s)]
*  based outside Russia has never had [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=681.76s)]
*  this much international support. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=684.64s)]
*  Joining us now is Vladimir Ashurkov. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=688.28s)]
*  He is the executive director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=690.56s)]
*  Foundation. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=693.68s)]
*  Mr. Ashurkov, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=694.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=698.24s)]
*  Your organization, the Anti-Corruption Fund, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=700.0s)]
*  has been documenting Russian corruption and kleptocracy [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=702.16s)]
*  for years. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=706.04s)]
*  Obviously, these sanctions have hit, as you said, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=707.56s)]
*  the elite in a place that you've been trying [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=711.48s)]
*  to get them hit for a while. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=714.04s)]
*  Have they had the effect that you're hoping they have? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=715.36s)]
*  Are these elites, are these people who are wealthy, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  are these people who are dealing and trading with Vladimir [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=721.52s)]
*  Putin feeling enough pressure to be able to fight back or even [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  speak out about it? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=728.36s)]
*  We have been advocating personal sanctions [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=733.0799999999999s)]
*  against people involved in corruption and human rights [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=735.4s)]
*  abuse for years. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=738.4s)]
*  And if the Western countries have [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=740.36s)]
*  been more belligerent in counting Putin's assertiveness [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=742.48s)]
*  over the last eight years, we might [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=747.48s)]
*  have averted the catastrophe of the last month and a half. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=749.72s)]
*  We are where we are. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=754.64s)]
*  And over the last month, there has [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  been an avalanche of personal sanctions. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=759.0799999999999s)]
*  Sanctions, it's a blunt instrument. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=762.16s)]
*  It's not a silver bullet that will guarantee removal of Putin [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=765.12s)]
*  and Russia returning to the normal path of development. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=770.4s)]
*  They don't have a short-term effect. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=775.2s)]
*  If you sanction an oligarch today, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=778.0s)]
*  it's naive to expect that he will make an appointment [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=781.64s)]
*  with Putin and persuade him to end the hostilities in Ukraine. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=785.88s)]
*  And everything will go back to normal situation. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=790.8s)]
*  But these sanctions, they do create a motivation [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=798.28s)]
*  for people in the elite to come up with a plan [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=801.68s)]
*  to change things in Russia. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=806.8399999999999s)]
*  Because only after things in Russia are changed, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=809.56s)]
*  people that have amassed billions during Putin's era [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=813.52s)]
*  can expect the sanctions to be lifted. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=819.84s)]
*  Vladimir Shurkov, thank you for joining us. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=825.4s)]
*  You are the executive director of Alexei Navalny's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=827.52s)]
*  Anti-Corruption Foundation. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=830.12s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  Some of the most enduring images of the Russian invasion [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=835.2s)]
*  of Ukraine are of refugees leaving everything behind [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=837.76s)]
*  as they flee war, except their pets. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=840.88s)]
*  But this beautiful big black dog was somehow [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=844.08s)]
*  left behind in an abandoned village near Kiev. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=846.2800000000001s)]
*  The dog is a schnauzer named Bavaria, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=849.52s)]
*  was found by Ukrainian soldiers who were inspecting [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=852.76s)]
*  homes in the village. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=855.08s)]
*  They found him inside a house that [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=856.04s)]
*  had been damaged by shelling. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=857.44s)]
*  What the dog's full backstory is and where [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=859.24s)]
*  his original people are, we may never know. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=861.6800000000001s)]
*  But now he's embarking on a new chapter. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=864.4s)]
*  The soldiers brought the dog into Kiev [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=867.4s)]
*  and into the arms of a woman named Olga, who [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=869.72s)]
*  volunteers with their regiment. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=872.64s)]
*  She says she's always wanted a big black dog, so she's happy. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=874.5600000000001s)]
*  The dog's happy. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=877.76s)]
*  Olga's cat has relocated to the top of the refrigerator. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=879.4s)]
*  Whether this will be Bavaria, the dog's forever home, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=884.08s)]
*  or whether he's eventually reunited [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=887.32s)]
*  with his original people, for now, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=889.12s)]
*  this is a happy ending for everyone, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=891.52s)]
*  except possibly the cat. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=893.92s)]
*  Joining us now from Lviv is Sudarsan Raghavan, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=896.64s)]
*  the correspondent at large for The Washington Post. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=898.84s)]
*  In his latest reporting, he talked to Ukrainian soldiers [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=901.12s)]
*  in a town near Kiev as they tried to push the Russians out. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=903.96s)]
*  Sudarsan, good to see you. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=907.84s)]
*  Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=909.12s)]
*  I want to talk first about what I said at the top of the show, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=911.12s)]
*  the reports of two Ukrainian military helicopters [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=913.96s)]
*  striking a Russian oil depot. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=917.32s)]
*  Doesn't sound like that big of a deal, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=919.84s)]
*  given how many missile strikes and attacks [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=921.5600000000001s)]
*  there have been in Ukraine, but it really is. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=923.32s)]
*  It's a huge deal. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=928.24s)]
*  I mean, no one expected this to happen at all. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=929.24s)]
*  I mean, throughout this, for the past six weeks, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=931.12s)]
*  the Ukrainians have basically done a lot [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=933.64s)]
*  of mostly defensive action. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=936.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's only been in the past week or so [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=938.28s)]
*  they started mounting counteroffensives [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=940.92s)]
*  on specific targets in and around Kiev and others, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=943.24s)]
*  but very small kind of localized counteroffensives. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=946.56s)]
*  So the fact that they went across the border, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=950.3199999999999s)]
*  took two helicopters and knocked out this oil depot [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=954.1999999999999s)]
*  is extremely significant for several reasons. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=958.8399999999999s)]
*  Chief among them is that, first of all, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=961.8399999999999s)]
*  it shows that the Ukrainians have the capability [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=964.64s)]
*  to go across and do something like this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=966.8s)]
*  and take the battle into Russian soil. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=969.4799999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, it also challenges Russia's, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=972.56s)]
*  seriously challenges Russia's narrative of the war. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=977.0799999999999s)]
*  The Russian propaganda machine has told Russian people [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=979.4799999999999s)]
*  and the world that basically that they are in control. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=983.4s)]
*  They had destroyed the Ukrainian air forces, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=986.4799999999999s)]
*  their air bases, that, you know, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=988.68s)]
*  and so this attack literally shows [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=990.52s)]
*  that the Russians were wrong [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=992.9599999999999s)]
*  and they don't have the war under control [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=995.12s)]
*  and the Ukrainians still have the capability [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=999.5600000000001s)]
*  of air capability of doing such a massive hit. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1001.84s)]
*  Sudarsan, you reported this week from a town near Kiev [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  where Ukrainian forces were engaged [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1013.08s)]
*  in pushing the Russians back. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1014.72s)]
*  And I wanna just play a little bit of the video [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1016.08s)]
*  that accompanied your story. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1018.2s)]
*  This is of a Ukrainian soldier who comes across a backpack [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1019.88s)]
*  abandoned by a Russian soldier. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1023.6s)]
*  Ooh, he forgot his ammo when he was running [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1027.64s)]
*  and the scissors. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1032.4s)]
*  Well, that's not very useful. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1037.44s)]
*  Look, he was a machine gunner. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1039.24s)]
*  Yes, he was a machine gunner. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1043.68s)]
*  You see, I'm just looking for something useful [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  because that's how war works. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1048.76s)]
*  That's useful. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1052.2s)]
*  Give us a sense, Sudarsan, of what that was about [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1055.96s)]
*  and how these Ukrainian troops that you encountered [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1059.16s)]
*  are feeling about this war. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  Right, well, as you can see from this video, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1065.0s)]
*  that was Sergeant Anton Kolombet [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1068.04s)]
*  and you could see the confidence he was feeling. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1069.52s)]
*  He was extremely calm. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1072.2s)]
*  He picked up this backpack and looking for things of use [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1073.64s)]
*  and you can really see it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1077.04s)]
*  Now, that event was on a Tuesday [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1080.88s)]
*  and even more in that town of Moshun, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1083.52s)]
*  there was shelling going on incessantly. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1086.12s)]
*  And so the Russians were only about two miles away [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1088.6s)]
*  and they were shelling us [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1092.84s)]
*  and the returnees were returning the fire. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1094.32s)]
*  And the very next day too, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1097.16s)]
*  one of our photographers went there [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1099.64s)]
*  and the shelling also continued on that Wednesday. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1100.88s)]
*  So between Thursday and Friday, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1103.52s)]
*  the Russians just departed the airport. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1106.48s)]
*  That town, by the way, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1108.52s)]
*  is only five miles away from the airport [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1109.3600000000001s)]
*  you talked about at the beginning of the program, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1112.24s)]
*  the Hostomil Airport, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1115.16s)]
*  which the Russians want to use [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1116.24s)]
*  to try and capture the capital, Kiev. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1118.6s)]
*  So in this town, the soldiers were extremely confident. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1121.4s)]
*  They had, just a week earlier, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1126.68s)]
*  they had managed to push the Russians out of this village [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1129.0s)]
*  and they were using all sorts of ambushes, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1132.0s)]
*  guerrilla tactics, street to street fighting. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1134.28s)]
*  They even destroyed a dam, they told me, nearby, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1136.16s)]
*  which allowed the river that's flowing by this village [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1140.3200000000002s)]
*  to flood up. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1143.92s)]
*  That prevented Russian forces [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1144.88s)]
*  from bringing in reinforcements [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1147.52s)]
*  and resupplying their soldiers inside the village. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1149.3200000000002s)]
*  And they had to literally push back [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1153.0s)]
*  and literally had to cross that flooded river now [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1154.76s)]
*  to get away from the Ukrainian forces. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1158.0400000000002s)]
*  So yeah, it was a significant victory for the Ukrainians, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1161.16s)]
*  but I think at that moment, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1166.16s)]
*  no one, not a single soldier earlier in the week, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1167.6000000000001s)]
*  had expected that the Russians would just simply pick up [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1171.3600000000001s)]
*  and leave the airport, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1174.8400000000001s)]
*  as well as leave the entire areas around the capital. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC9wWoQU0M4&t=1176.16s)]
