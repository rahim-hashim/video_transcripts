# Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Could Infringe On Space Program's Neutrality
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0)
*  Late last night, three men said goodbye to fellow crew members on the International Space Station [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=0.0s)]
*  and made their way into a tiny Soyuz capsule for their return to Earth 250 miles below. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=5.0s)]
*  Earlier today, the three men made it safely back to the ground, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=11.0s)]
*  plopping down in a big puff of dust in the Kazakhstan desert. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=15.0s)]
*  Inside that capsule were two Russian cosmonauts and one American astronaut, Mark Vande Hei. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=20.0s)]
*  All three men were extracted from the capsule safely and after some medical testing, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=26.0s)]
*  they went their separate ways, heading back to their home nations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=30.0s)]
*  Images like these of Americans and Russians and Europeans and others working together [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=34.0s)]
*  and depending on each other are how space exploration is supposed to work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=38.0s)]
*  250 miles above Earth, national boundaries are supposed to disappear, along with terrestrial politics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=43.0s)]
*  Up there, it's about mutual dependence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=49.0s)]
*  But politics did threaten to intervene earlier this month, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=52.0s)]
*  after the US started imposing sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=55.0s)]
*  The head of Russia's space agency warned that sanctions against Russia [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=60.0s)]
*  could disrupt their ability to keep the ISS up in orbit [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=63.0s)]
*  and also stop supplying rocket engines to two US aerospace suppliers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=67.0s)]
*  And Russia still has not signed on to an agreement to extend the life of the space station past 2024. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=72.0s)]
*  And then there's China, which is building its own space station [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=79.0s)]
*  and is strengthening its ties with Russia in space as well as on Earth. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=82.0s)]
*  While war rages over terra firma, low Earth orbit is considered neutral territory. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=87.0s)]
*  For now. But watch this space. Literally. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=93.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thNq39j_R0&t=109.0s)]
