# Putin flexes expansionist muscles as GOP stalling starves Ukraine of military aid
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE)
*  This past weekend, Putin met with the hand-picked pro-Kremlin leader of part of Moldova that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=0.0s)]
*  Putin wants to break off from that country to make it part of Russia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=7.44s)]
*  Just like he's been breaking off pieces of Ukraine and taking those pieces for himself [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=11.44s)]
*  and forcing those parts of Ukraine to be part of Russia now, he also appears to have designs [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=14.84s)]
*  on parts of Moldova to do the same thing to them. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=19.34s)]
*  When Putin brought this pro-Kremlin leader of a breakaway part of Moldova over to Moscow [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=24.2s)]
*  to meet with him, the president of Moldova got so alarmed by Putin taking that meeting, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=30.04s)]
*  by what Putin said about how Russia might need to go in and take care of things in Moldova [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=35.92s)]
*  sometime soon the way it has in Ukraine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=40.08s)]
*  She was so alarmed by that that she flew in person to the first European NATO country [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=43.4s)]
*  that would agree to form a defense agreement with her country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=48.92s)]
*  The president of Moldova flew to France, signed a new agreement with France where France [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=52.22s)]
*  hereby agrees to come to the aid of Moldova if indeed Putin attacks there too, just like [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=56.72s)]
*  he attacked Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=62.3s)]
*  Poland's building bomb shelters. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=64.22s)]
*  Moldova is forming new defense alliances as Putin is threatening to invade Moldova too. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=67.58s)]
*  Now a third one, the nation of Georgia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=72.74s)]
*  Reuters reporting this weekend that in the nation of Georgia, which doesn't border Ukraine, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=74.9s)]
*  borders Russia directly, another one of these handpicked pro-Kremlin officials from part [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=80.32s)]
*  of that country that Putin wants to break off and make it part of Russia instead, that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  local leader in Georgia has, quote, discussed its possible inclusion into Russia with Moscow, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=90.6s)]
*  according to Russian state media. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=99.28s)]
*  So he brings over a pro-Kremlin handpicked leader from part of Georgia that Russia wants [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=102.32s)]
*  to break off from Georgia and make it part of their own country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=108.24s)]
*  So Putin has invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  He's in the third year of his war in Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=114.96s)]
*  He's threatening two more countries on his border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=117.32s)]
*  Another country that's bordering Ukraine is threatened enough by how he's behaving toward [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=120.5s)]
*  them that they're building bomb shelters for civilians in their capital city. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  Just a few days ago in a fourth country in the same neighborhood in Lithuania, which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=129.42s)]
*  borders both Poland and Russia, we had a vicious hammer attack, what appears to have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=132.9s)]
*  been an attempted murder, broke the guy's arms, smashed him up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=140.58s)]
*  A hammer attack on an ally of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  Alexei Navalny was, of course, himself recently assassinated in a Russian prison. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=149.82s)]
*  So you put all this together and what you're talking about here is a geopolitical wrecking [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  ball. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  This isn't one war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=161.2s)]
*  This isn't a country with a border dispute. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=163.38s)]
*  What Putin is making happen in the world right now is constant war and destabilization and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=168.0s)]
*  threats and terroristic violence and assassinations in multiple bordering countries and pushing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=174.06s)]
*  right into NATO. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=180.0s)]
*  And, of course, when he pushes into NATO, that directly implicates us. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=181.0s)]
*  Putin was asked ahead of this weekend's Potemkin election in Russia about whether he wants [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=186.9s)]
*  to engage in peace talks with Ukraine since that war is now in its third year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=192.9s)]
*  Putin scoffed at that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=197.94s)]
*  He said, why should he bother doing that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=199.82s)]
*  Just because Ukraine is running out of ammunition now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=201.76s)]
*  And indeed, Ukraine is running out of ammunition now. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=206.16s)]
*  And that's largely because of us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=209.56s)]
*  It's because of the Republican Party, at least in the United States of America. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=211.46s)]
*  Since pro-Trump hardliners installed a new Trumpier Republican speaker of the House, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=215.24s)]
*  American aid to Ukraine has stopped. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=222.18s)]
*  And so, yes, Ukraine is running out of ammunition to fight Russia. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=223.9s)]
*  So why would Russia stop and hold peace talks or anything else right now? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=229.02s)]
*  Putin can see how this is going to end as long as the Republicans in the United States [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=234.18s)]
*  of America keep doing their part to help. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a terrible wrecking ball with apparently limitless ambitions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=244.06s)]
*  It's one thing to start the largest land war in Europe since World War II. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=249.04s)]
*  It's another thing to be three years into that and starting to rattle your saber at [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=253.44s)]
*  multiple other countries on your own borders and the borders of the country you have already [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=259.0s)]
*  invaded. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3S9xTZ7DGE&t=263.92s)]
