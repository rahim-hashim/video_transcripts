# GOP Fake Elector Scheme Shows New Level Of Disrespect For U.S. Voters: Election Official
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg)
*  Just to play dumb here a little bit for a second, I think I know the answer to this, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Benson, but tell me, tell me true. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=4.68s)]
*  Is this the sort of thing that has happened before in the state of Michigan? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=9.4s)]
*  Is this something that you have ever seen in your role as the chief administrator of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=12.38s)]
*  elections in the state? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=16.44s)]
*  Is this something that just looks weird to us from a national perspective, but actually [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=18.56s)]
*  people try this kind of thing all the time? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=21.34s)]
*  No. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=23.64s)]
*  And for good reason. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=24.64s)]
*  I mean, this is, you know, we up until really 2020 had seen a great deal of respect and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  deference to our voters, which was really upended in the chaos and confusion that we [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=31.04s)]
*  saw surrounding the 2020 post-election process. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=37.52s)]
*  So this is unprecedented. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=41.2s)]
*  We're in unchartered territory. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=42.2s)]
*  You know, I know both of us have been asked a lot as this has come out, what was legal, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=43.84s)]
*  what was illegal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=48.68s)]
*  And I think it's important to emphasize here that this is all unprecedented, but it also [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=49.68s)]
*  underscores why it's so important for us to not just ensure truth continues to emerge [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=54.32s)]
*  as to just how far folks were willing to go to overturn a free and fair election just [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=60.36s)]
*  because they didn't like the results, because we not only need to see justice and accountability [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=65.56s)]
*  in this manner for those who broke the law, but we need to work to put protections in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  place to ensure we do not see a repeat of these nefarious tactics in future elections. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp4j8U8CJRg&t=74.56s)]
