Video Description: Just two days into his new term, Donald Trump appears to be burning through political capital and alienating his allies (and supplicants) with his decision to indiscriminately pardon January 6 rioters, resulting in what can only be described as a debacle. Rachel Maddow reads a portion of Judge Beryl Howell's rebuke.

# Judge excoriates Trump for pardoning January 6 'poor losers' as debacle grows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E)
*  We've also had another day of Republicans just being fundamentally unable to answer questions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=0.0s)]
*  about what Trump did here and whether or not they really support it. Republican House Speaker Mike [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=5.84s)]
*  Johnson today earned laughter when he tried to say that he didn't want to talk about the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  pardons anymore. He didn't want to look back. Didn't want to look back at those pardons from [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=15.36s)]
*  yesterday. He only wants to look forward. And then right after he said that, he announced that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=20.56s)]
*  Republicans are going to go back and reinvestigate all of January 6th all over again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=25.28s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson not able to get out of his own way, not able to figure out how to answer [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=32.72s)]
*  questions about these pardons yet, and they're not going away. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=38.32s)]
*  criticizing Trump's pardons today. The pro-Trump right-wing editorial page at the Wall Street [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Journal criticizing the pardons today. Calling them rotten. Senator John Thune, the Republican [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=47.84s)]
*  leader in the Senate, pilloried for trying to insist that the pardons were considered on a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=56.0s)]
*  case-by-case basis when they absolutely were not. Everybody with a January 6th conviction, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=61.36s)]
*  everybody got a pardon or commutation. There was no case-by-case consideration, Senator. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  And on top of all of that, now tonight there has been an extraordinary rebuke of these pardons [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=73.04s)]
*  from the court system. And again, we're going to talk about this more a little bit later on, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  but I just want you to listen to this. I'm not sure this is widely circulated today. I do not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  think you will have heard about this, but this is from Judge Barrel Howell of the Federal District [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  Court in Washington, D.C. Just listen to this. I'm just quoting directly here. The United States [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=95.68s)]
*  government moves to dismiss with prejudice the nine-count superseding indictment against [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  defendants Nicholas DiCarlo and Nicholas Oaks. The two defendants in this case, one of whom [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=106.56s)]
*  founded the Hawaii chapter of the Proud Boys and served as a senior leader of the group, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=111.2s)]
*  both admitted under oath their criminal conduct at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Both men [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  admitted throwing smoke bombs at law enforcement while on the grounds of the Capitol. Both men [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=121.68s)]
*  admitted to breaching the Capitol building and defacing the Capitol building and saying that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=125.76s)]
*  stealing equipment from law enforcement officers responding to protect the building [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=131.6s)]
*  and its lawful occupants from the rioters. The current posture of this case is that even after [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=136.16s)]
*  the defendant's admission of egregious criminal conduct both outside and inside the U.S. Capitol [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=143.2s)]
*  building and the government expending significant time and resources in identifying defendants, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=148.48s)]
*  investigating their criminal conduct and filing three separate indictments against these defendants, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=153.92s)]
*  the government now seeks to dismiss the pending indictment against these defendants. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=159.2s)]
*  Judge Howell then explains that while the court under law doesn't have much of a choice to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=166.48s)]
*  continue a criminal case if the government decides to drop it, she's sort of compelled to drop it if [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=173.04s)]
*  they want to want to drop it, she says the law does quote, vest some discretion in the court [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=177.76s)]
*  in terms of how to handle the details of this unusual situation. And check this out, this is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=186.0s)]
*  astonishing, quote, to ensure that the government's request for dismissal of criminal charges [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=191.68s)]
*  sufficiently protects the public, the government may be required to submit a statement of reasons [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=197.44000000000003s)]
*  and underlying factual basis, which must be substantial to justify the dismissal of an [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  indictment. Here, the government's cursory motion provides no factual basis for dismissal. The only [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  reason provided for this instruction is the assertion that this action, quote, ends a grave [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=214.72s)]
*  national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=220.56s)]
*  begins a process of national reconciliation. That was in Trump's order that all of these cases should [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=226.16s)]
*  be dropped and a national ends a grave national injustice. Judge Howell continues, quote, no [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=232.64s)]
*  national injustice occurred here, just as no outcome determinative election fraud occurred in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=240.32s)]
*  the 2020 presidential election. No process of national reconciliation can begin when, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=246.16s)]
*  I'm quoting the judge here directly, when poor losers whose preferred candidate loses an election [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=252.0s)]
*  are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=258.0s)]
*  impunity. That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=263.12s)]
*  poor losers and undermines the rule of law. She says, quote, having presided over scores of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=268.96s)]
*  criminal cases charging defendants for their criminal conduct outside and inside the U.S. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=275.76s)]
*  Capitol building on January 6th, which charges were fully supported by evidence in the form of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  extensive videotapes and photographs, admissions by defendants and testimony at trials. This court, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=286.0s)]
*  she says, cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=292.32s)]
*  quote, the prosecutions in this case and others charging defendants for their criminal conduct [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=299.84s)]
*  at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th present no injustice, but instead reflect the diligent work [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=304.64s)]
*  of conscientious public servants, including prosecutors and law enforcement officials and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  dedicated defense attorneys to defend our democracy and rights and preserve our long [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=317.12s)]
*  tradition of peaceful transfers of power, which until January 6th, 2021, served as a model to the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=322.08s)]
*  world, all while affording those charged every protection guaranteed by our constitution and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=328.56s)]
*  our criminal justice system. As to these two defendants, she says, as to these two defendants, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=334.88s)]
*  specifically both admitted their criminal conduct under oath after consultation with their attorneys [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=341.36s)]
*  and pursuant to plea agreements to which they agreed. Bluntly put, the assertion offered in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=346.64s)]
*  the presidential pronouncement for the pending motion to dismiss is flatly wrong. Judge Beryl [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=351.28s)]
*  Howell goes on to grant the government's demand that she dismiss this case because she has to do [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=359.36s)]
*  that, but she refuses to do what Trump's order said she had to do, which was to dismiss it with [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=366.08s)]
*  prejudice, which means these charges could never be brought again. She just refuses to do that. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=374.64s)]
*  The judge says, quote, nothing about the government's reasoning for dismissal warrants [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=380.08s)]
*  entry of dismissal with prejudice. Dismissal with prejudice, she says, would bar any further [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=385.04s)]
*  prosecution of defendants for their offense conduct at issue. This result would be improper here [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=390.64s)]
*  when the defendant's own admissions of criminal conduct, including throwing smoke bombs at law [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=396.24s)]
*  enforcement officers who were trying valiantly to prevent rioters from entering the Capitol [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=401.44s)]
*  building, that conduct provides ample basis for criminal prosecution. Judge Howell then orders [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=405.84s)]
*  this case dismissed, this case effectively closed, but she flat out refuses to order the case closed [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=416.0s)]
*  forever. This directive from Trump effectively told the judge to close it with prejudice so the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=422.48s)]
*  case could never be brought again. She said, no, you're wrong on that on the law and I won't do it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=429.76s)]
*  And also in so many words, by the way, what you're doing here is obscene. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  This is one of three rulings by a federal judge today, absolutely rebuking [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=442.48s)]
*  Donald Trump and his new Justice Department for trying to make these January 6 cases disappear, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=450.32s)]
*  to try to make it like January 6 didn't happen. The decision to spring these guys from prison [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=456.4s)]
*  and to stop the ongoing trials of people convicted or charged with physically attacking police [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  officers, this is a debacle. I mean, morally, it's obviously a debacle. Strategically, in terms of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=472.08s)]
*  our country holding itself together, it's a debacle, but it's a political debacle. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=479.28s)]
*  The public doesn't like it. The police don't like it. Not even the Trumpy police like it. Even the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=483.76s)]
*  Fraternal Order of Police, which endorsed Trump and initially appeared flummoxed by this pardons [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=489.12s)]
*  decision, they've now come out and denounced it as well. The violent felons who Trump ordered [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=493.84s)]
*  freed yesterday are already today starting to be arrested for other violent crimes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  His political allies on Capitol Hill are supposed to start carrying major water for him on everything [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=507.12s)]
*  he wants to do. They are already finding it totally untenable to carry water for him on this [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=512.4s)]
*  first thing that he has decided to blow all his political capital on. I mean, some of the felons [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=517.52s)]
*  he freed, including one of the paramilitary leaders who Trump just freed from his 18-year [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=526.24s)]
*  federal prison sentence, this guy turned up at Capitol Hill today. Turned up on Capitol Hill. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  There are rumors circulating that Trump had wanted to bring his felons, had wanted to bring [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=539.68s)]
*  these guys who violently attacked police and were convicted for it. He wants to bring them all to the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=544.16s)]
*  White House, too. That's the sort of thing that probably sounded great at a Trump rally. Probably [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  sounded like it was something that people wanted when you were stewing about stuff like this at a [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=556.4s)]
*  Trump rally at one of your Fidel Castro-esque three-and-a-half-hour-long rambly speeches [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=560.8s)]
*  where most of the people left before you were halfway through it. Probably sounded like a great [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=566.48s)]
*  idea that everybody would love you for. But you know what? The country is not a Trump rally. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=570.08s)]
*  And the country appears to be repulsed by the very first big thing that Donald Trump has done [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=574.4s)]
*  in his new presidential term. And whether or not he can see it, every other Republican in Washington [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=582.32s)]
*  is learning it very quickly, at least all of them who can read polls. And they're learning it very [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=590.32s)]
*  quickly. Polls are learning it very quickly. Any of them who can read polls or who can hear the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=596.4s)]
*  questions from their own constituents back home and from reporters about the what about what the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=601.68s)]
*  heck is this mess with freeing these convicted violent felons? And does the senator support it? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=606.48s)]
*  Does the congressman support it? And can you explain why? And saying you haven't seen the details [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  or you don't know exactly what's happened here or you want to look more into it, that answer [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=621.04s)]
*  is gonna fly. It's an absolute debacle. And I think importantly, as my good friend Chris Hayes [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=626.16s)]
*  often says, politics did not stop when Donald Trump was elected. The laws of political gravity [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=633.76s)]
*  still apply. And Donald Trump's first major action in his second presidential term on political [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  grounds is a political debacle. And that matters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=645.52s)]
*  you [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idyyfj2XB-E&t=656.16s)]
