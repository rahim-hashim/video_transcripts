# Despite Red Flags, Florida Republicans Poised To Confirm Questionable Surgeon General
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA)
*  This was the splash page of the Tallahassee Democrat yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=0.0s)]
*  The top headline there says, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=3.6s)]
*  Surgeon General got scathing review from UCLA in background check. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=5.28s)]
*  The paper obtained that background check through an open records request. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=10.16s)]
*  It was conducted as part of Dr. Latipo's Senate confirmation process, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=14.5s)]
*  which is currently ongoing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=18.36s)]
*  It offers a searing evaluation of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=19.96s)]
*  the state's top doctor from one of his former supervisors at UCLA. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Here it is, quote, would you recommend the applicant for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  employment as Surgeon General of Florida and confidence in his ability, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  honesty, and integrity to perform related duties? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=36.0s)]
*  The supervisor's answer, quote, no. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  In my opinion, the people of Florida would be better served by a Surgeon General [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=42.0s)]
*  who grounds his policy in decisions and recommendations in the best scientific [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=46.0s)]
*  evidence rather than opinions, end quote. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=50.92s)]
*  The supervisor added, by the way, that Dr. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=54.68s)]
*  Latipo's opinions published in a number of popular media outlets were contrary to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=56.64s)]
*  the best scientific evidence available about the COVID-19 pandemic and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  caused concern among a large number of his research and clinical colleagues and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=65.6s)]
*  subordinates who felt that his opinions violated the Hippocratic oath [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=70.12s)]
*  that physicians do no harm. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=75.36s)]
*  We're not done, he continued. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=78.92s)]
*  The situation created stress and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=80.76s)]
*  acrimony among his coworkers and supervisors during the last year and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=82.4s)]
*  a half of his employment, end quote. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=86.44s)]
*  Okay, now I'm done. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=88.6s)]
*  How is that for a job recommendation? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=90.12s)]
*  We reached back out to the Florida Department of Health for comment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=93.0s)]
*  Their press secretary described the UCLA official as a disgruntled supervisor, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=95.52s)]
*  adding that, quote, doctors who were considered ahead of their time were [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=100.84s)]
*  applauded for their brilliance throughout history. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=104.2s)]
*  But it now appears that being at the forefront of ideas and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  following the data is now considered a political game, end quote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=110.44s)]
*  This is quite the backdrop against which Dr. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Latipo is trying to get confirmed as Florida's top doctor. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=119.36s)]
*  We covered Latipo's first confirmation hearing last week, the same one in which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=122.84s)]
*  he repeatedly refused to give a yes or no answer to a question about whether [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=126.92s)]
*  COVID vaccines work. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=131.84s)]
*  The Democrats got up and walked out of that hearing saying they were fed up with [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Latipo's refusal to offer straight answers. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Latipo still has one more committee hearing before his nomination goes to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  a full vote in the Florida Senate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=145.48s)]
*  So what can we expect? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=148.04s)]
*  Well, joining us now is Florida State Senator Tina Polsky. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  She sits on the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  which Dr. Latipo will be testifying before next week. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=154.92s)]
*  Dr. Latipo refused to wear a mask while visiting Senator Polsky's office last [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=159.12s)]
*  year, even though she asked him to, citing a serious medical condition. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=163.8s)]
*  Senator Polsky later revealed she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=167.52s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this evening. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=172.44s)]
*  Thanks, Ali, for having me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=176.36s)]
*  This is alarming. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=177.36s)]
*  This is not a random job that Dr. Latipo is going for. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=178.4s)]
*  It doesn't vindicate him. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=185.4s)]
*  All of these documents keep coming out to suggest that he's not in line with [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=186.56s)]
*  mainstream medical thinking. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=189.96s)]
*  But the math we do here indicates that he is going to get his appointment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=191.56s)]
*  It certainly looks that way, which is very frustrating because we only are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  a Senate of 40 people, we're close colleagues, and yet we are so [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=202.4s)]
*  divided on issues such as this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=206.36s)]
*  So he is going to come before my committee. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  There's four Democrats. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  We are outnumbered. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=213.0s)]
*  We will ask lots and lots of questions. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=213.88s)]
*  We will debate, but he will get through. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  And the next step is the floor. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=219.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, we are again outnumbered. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=221.28s)]
*  And he will get the nom- excuse me, not the nomination, he's been nominated. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=223.72s)]
*  He will become the permanent surgeon general. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=227.4s)]
*  And it's really frustrating because I know my colleagues know he is not the right [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=230.16s)]
*  person for the job. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=233.8s)]
*  They sat there in the first committee. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=235.16s)]
*  They heard his non-answers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  They know the background. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=239.6s)]
*  They know how he treated me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=240.8s)]
*  And yet he's still going to be confirmed, and it's really frustrating. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=242.72s)]
*  How did that go down, how he treated you? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=245.36s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=247.36s)]
*  Because even if we didn't have COVID, if somebody told me, could you please wear [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=248.12s)]
*  a mask because I'm immunocompromised, it would be a no-brainer. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=251.08s)]
*  I'd wear the mask. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  What kind of response do you get to that kind of thing? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=255.4s)]
*  What happened? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=258.2s)]
*  It was just the most disrespectful. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=260.48s)]
*  And since then, a lot of people haven't seen him interact. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=263.0s)]
*  But when you saw his answers in the first committee, vague and arrogant and smug, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=267.48s)]
*  is how I described him in my office, he tried to do the same thing in my office. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=273.68s)]
*  We kind of have a waiting area. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  I asked him and his two colleagues to put on a mask before we went in to talk at the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  meeting which he requested. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=283.32s)]
*  And he refused to do so and just stood there and tried to debate and give me alternative [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  theories and, well, let's come up with another option. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's exactly the kind of nonsense that he spewed at the last confirmation hearing, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=294.04s)]
*  just talking, talking. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  I described it as word salad. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  And so it was exactly who he is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=302.56s)]
*  He has proven who he is over and over again. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=305.8s)]
*  And the disrespect that he showed the senator coming to my office at his request, it was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=308.2s)]
*  so simple to put on a mask. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=313.76s)]
*  And had he done so, there would be no story. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=315.08s)]
*  So I just don't understand how a doctor can treat someone that way. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=317.24s)]
*  I'm one of the 22 million citizens of Florida that he would be in charge of our public health. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=322.28s)]
*  And he just didn't care. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Do your Republican colleagues in the Senate care, though, because they can't all be anti-mask, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  anti-vax, anti-science people? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=336.35999999999996s)]
*  Like at some point, he's the outlier. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  They're not that way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=341.88s)]
*  I know they're not that way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=343.28s)]
*  There might be a few, but they're really not. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=344.28s)]
*  And I know that they're caring, but the political winds are such that they cannot go against [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=346.64s)]
*  this governor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  And it's really sad and unfortunate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=352.84s)]
*  It's kind of the one good thing about being in the minority party is we can speak our [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=355.08s)]
*  minds and the majority just seems to be locked in and they don't ask questions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=359.0s)]
*  They don't debate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=365.2s)]
*  And they just kind of sit there and take it and they will vote him in. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=366.8s)]
*  What strange times. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, thank you for your efforts, Florida State Senator Tina Polsky. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us tonight. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1bnhbhFvlA&t=375.58s)]
