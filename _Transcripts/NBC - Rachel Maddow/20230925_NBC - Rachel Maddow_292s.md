# 'I have much higher standards in men.': Hutchinson rejects Gaetz claim; Calls out creeps
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI)
*  Ms. Hutchinson, one of the claims in your book that received some attention ahead of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=0.0s)]
*  publication is an allegation you make that Rudy Giuliani effectively groped you at the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=5.28s)]
*  Trump rally on January 6th. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=11.92s)]
*  You say that he reached his hand under your blazer and then under your skirt. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani's spokesperson has called this a disgusting lie against Mayor Giuliani. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=19.56s)]
*  He gave us that statement again himself tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=25.22s)]
*  But I was struck by the fact that he was not the only one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=27.6s)]
*  Page 52 of the book you say that John Boehner, of all people, looked down at my cranberry [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=31.68s)]
*  vodka and whispered, dark liquor or red wine from now on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=37.18s)]
*  Then he tugged on the ends of my hair saying, and lose the ponytail. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=40.84s)]
*  You describe one man who worked in the White House, Mike McKenna, as having a tendency [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=46.56s)]
*  to publicly single out women with crude and demeaning comments. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=50.72s)]
*  You describe the president, and this is not groping, this is not physical, but you describe [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=55.28s)]
*  him as telling you to add blonde highlights to your hair, which you then went home and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=60.04s)]
*  did and came back to the White House the next day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=64.0s)]
*  That doesn't happen in normal workplaces. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=66.88s)]
*  I'm just telling you now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=68.56s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=69.56s)]
*  I learn a lot on the outside. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=70.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=72.56s)]
*  There's a whole world out there when guys get fired for doing stuff like that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=73.56s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=76.76s)]
*  Well, it shouldn't be unbelievable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=77.76s)]
*  It shouldn't be unbelievable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  There's also a couple of instances involving Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=82.96s)]
*  I will omit most of the context here, but I'll tell you the lines that have kept me [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  up and uncomfortable. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  He chuckled and brushed his thumb across my chin. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=93.74s)]
*  Has anyone ever told you you're a national treasure? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  You describe a night at Camp David when he was leaning against the doorframe while somebody [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=99.66s)]
*  answered the door to another cabin. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=106.5s)]
*  Matt straightened his posture when Kevin McCarthy asked him what he wanted. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=108.32s)]
*  He explained he had seen my golf cart parked outside and thought this was my cabin. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=111.52s)]
*  Embarrassed, I got up and asked Mr. Gaetz what he needed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  He explained that he was lost and asked me to escort him to his cabin. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=118.24s)]
*  I told him to proceed around the circle drive. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=122.64s)]
*  All the cabins are clearly marked. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=125.28s)]
*  It's impossible to get lost. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=126.72s)]
*  He asked me one more time to leave with him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy then said, quote, Get a life mat and shut the door. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=130.76s)]
*  Now, Mr. Gaetz, we asked him for comment on these allegations tonight. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=135.12s)]
*  He told us, I don't remember either of these events. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=139.26s)]
*  And based on Cassidy's prior false statements, I doubt they occurred. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=142.64s)]
*  I did date Cassidy for a few weeks when we were both single years ago. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=146.38s)]
*  We parted amicably and remained friends thereafter, even during President Trump's post presidency. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  And then he goes on to make other unrelated claims. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=159.0s)]
*  I'm sorry to ask you if you want to respond to that, but I'm going to ask you if you want [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=163.22s)]
*  to respond. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=166.5s)]
*  I'd love to respond to that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=167.5s)]
*  Thank you for giving me the option. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=168.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=169.98s)]
*  I will give Matt credit in part of his statement that we did have an amicable working relationship. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=170.98s)]
*  And we were good friends at points. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=177.3s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, in my opinion, is somebody that I personally do not hold in high regards in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=182.18s)]
*  terms of trust. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=187.7s)]
*  And I do not think that Matt Gaetz has the best track record for relationships and condoning [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=188.7s)]
*  how he thinks that they might be defined. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  I will say on behalf of myself, I never dated Matt Gaetz. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  I have much higher standards in men. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=203.7s)]
*  And Matt, frankly, is a very unserious politician. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=206.26s)]
*  We see that today with the ruckus that he is causing on Capitol Hill with the spending [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=209.7s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=214.17999999999998s)]
*  And I don't really have much else to say to somebody that is more concerned about a sound [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=215.89999999999998s)]
*  bite than actually passing legislation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=220.14s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani's remark in response to your allegation about him, which was graphic and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=223.62s)]
*  gross, was that this was a disgusting lie against him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=228.7s)]
*  Do you stand by that statement despite his pushback? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  I stand by my statement and what I described in the book. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=234.89999999999998s)]
*  And I agree that it was gross. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  Cassie Hutchinson, you have been through a lot, particularly as a very young woman who [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=242.26s)]
*  had to do a lot of this on her own. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  The record that you've given us is much, much, much more complete than anybody else could [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=247.7s)]
*  have given us. And it took a lot of bravery to get there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=252.14s)]
*  It's been a hard time in your life, but you've done a service to your country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=254.7s)]
*  And I hope that good things happen for you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=258.82s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=260.82s)]
*  Thank you. Congratulations. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=261.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=262.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=263.3s)]
*  Former White House aide Cassie Hutchinson has a new book. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=264.18s)]
*  It is called Enough. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=267.26s)]
*  It's out tomorrow. It is full of news. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=268.94s)]
*  You should read it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQLstlJL8OI&t=271.14s)]
