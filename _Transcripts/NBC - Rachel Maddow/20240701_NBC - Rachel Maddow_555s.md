# Sotomayor blasts Supreme Court's conservative majority for demolishing foundation of U.S. law
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg)
*  As we await Trump's sentencing in that case, this immunity ruling today from the Supreme [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=0.0s)]
*  Court is at hand. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=6.32s)]
*  And I'm not a lawyer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=8.96s)]
*  It is, as far as I can tell, in my layman's understanding, it is as radical as anything [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=10.84s)]
*  I have ever seen from the United States Supreme Court. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=18.72s)]
*  I can certainly tell you that it is profoundly worse. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=22.16s)]
*  It is a profoundly worse ruling than even the most pessimistic observers predicted. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=25.38s)]
*  There was essentially one substantial aspect of immunity for Trump that Trump and his lawyers [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=31.0s)]
*  put to the court that they did not get. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=35.78s)]
*  That was this sort of internally contradictory, confusing proposal they'd made that a president [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=38.42s)]
*  could only be criminally prosecuted for crimes if you first impeached him in the House and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=43.099999999999994s)]
*  convicted him in the Senate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=48.06s)]
*  The implication was that any failed impeachment effort would effectively immunize that behavior [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=50.06s)]
*  for life. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=56.580000000000005s)]
*  That thing about impeachment being connected in that way to a criminal prosecution, the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  court threw that out as nonsense. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=64.14s)]
*  But they gave him everything else he asked for and more. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=65.9s)]
*  They gave him immunity in every other way that he asked for it, including for things [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=69.26s)]
*  his own lawyer conceded weren't among Trump's official acts as president. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=72.66s)]
*  The things that Trump's lawyer conceded were private acts were described in today's majority [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=78.58s)]
*  ruling as things for which Trump might nevertheless potentially get immunity. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=83.86s)]
*  Here's how Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it in her dissent today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=91.02s)]
*  She said that the court, quote, refuses to designate any course of conduct alleged in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=94.68s)]
*  the indictment as private, despite concessions from Trump's counsel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=98.58s)]
*  She continues, when asked about allegations that private actors helped implement a plan [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=103.3s)]
*  to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=107.78s)]
*  And Trump and a co-conspirator attorney directed that effort. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=113.26s)]
*  Trump's counsel conceded the alleged conduct by Trump was private. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=116.62s)]
*  That says, quote, only the majority, meaning only the majority ruling in the court today [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=122.5s)]
*  thinks that organizing fraudulent slates of electors might qualify as an official act [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=128.22s)]
*  of the president. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=133.5s)]
*  In other words, Trump may be even more protected from prosecution on the fake electors thing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=134.5s)]
*  than even Trump asked for. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=141.14s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor's dissent is being cited widely today, not only because of its heat [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=145.06s)]
*  that it is considerably hot, but also because of the light that it sheds on the practical [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=151.58s)]
*  consequences of this ruling from the majority. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=157.22s)]
*  She says, quote, looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the long-term [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=161.18s)]
*  consequences of today's decision are stark. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=165.46s)]
*  The court effectively creates a law-free zone around the president, upsetting the status [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=169.12s)]
*  quo that has existed since the founding. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=174.22s)]
*  This new official act's immunity now lies about like a loaded weapon for any president [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  that wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival or his own financial [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=181.74s)]
*  gain above the interests of the nation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=186.32s)]
*  The president of the United States is the most powerful person in the country and possibly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=189.06s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=193.06s)]
*  When he uses his official powers in any way under the majority's reasoning, he now will [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=194.06s)]
*  be insulated from criminal prosecution. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=198.5s)]
*  Orders the Navy's SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=201.3s)]
*  Immune. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=205.02s)]
*  Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=206.02s)]
*  Immune. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=209.66000000000003s)]
*  Immune. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=211.9s)]
*  Immune, immune, immune. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=212.9s)]
*  Let the president violate the law. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=216.02s)]
*  Let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=217.94s)]
*  Let him use his official power for evil ends. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=221.02s)]
*  Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=224.18s)]
*  be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=228.46s)]
*  That's the majority's message today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=231.74s)]
*  Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=234.1s)]
*  has been done. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=238.18s)]
*  The relationship between the president and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=239.18s)]
*  In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=243.88s)]
*  She closes, quote, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=250.06s)]
*  "...never in the history of our republic has a president had reason to believe that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=251.06s)]
*  he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=254.7s)]
*  violate the criminal law. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=259.32s)]
*  Moving forward, however, all former presidents will be cloaked in such immunity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=260.8s)]
*  If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=265.26s)]
*  that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop." [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  She says, quote, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=275.68s)]
*  "...with fear for our democracy, I dissent." [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=276.68s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor's dissent was joined today by Justice Kagan and Justice Jackson. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=281.88s)]
*  The three of them, and through Justice Sotomayor's writing, this dissent, they have at least [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=287.6s)]
*  done us the favor of writing what's kind of a speaking dissent. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=292.18s)]
*  It spells out not in legalese but in plain English. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=295.68s)]
*  The stark consequences of this ruling today? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=299.2s)]
*  To his credit, actually, President Biden did the same tonight at the White House. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=303.9s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=307.18s)]
*  "...today's decision almost certainly means there's no limits to what a president can [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=308.18s)]
*  do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=311.82s)]
*  This is a fundamentally new principle and it's a dangerous precedent. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=312.82s)]
*  The power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even the Supreme Court [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=315.46s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=320.38s)]
*  The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone." [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=321.78s)]
*  But there are two practical consequences of this ruling that I feel like I need help in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=329.18s)]
*  understanding tonight. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=334.86s)]
*  I am worried about both of them, I have to tell you, but I feel like I need expert advice [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=335.96s)]
*  in terms of understanding what they really mean. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=340.64s)]
*  And so I'm going to ask for some help on two things in particular. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=342.72s)]
*  The first is this, which is not from the dissent but from the actual ruling. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=347.48s)]
*  It's talking about the part of the federal indictment against Trump for the overthrowing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=351.4s)]
*  the government staff or the January 6th staff, the part of the indictment that relates to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  him trying to use the Justice Department, trying to employ the Justice Department basically [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=360.82s)]
*  as a tool in his scheme to overthrow the government and hold on to power after he lost the election. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=366.7s)]
*  On that point specifically, the ruling says this, quote, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  "...the indictment's allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=377.17999999999995s)]
*  for an improper purpose do not divest the president of exclusive authority over the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=382.62s)]
*  investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=388.2s)]
*  Because the president cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=393.64s)]
*  authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  his discussion—his discussions with Justice Department officials." [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=403.22s)]
*  My question is, doesn't that mean the president, any president here, is being given overt carte blanche [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=408.82s)]
*  from the court that he or she can tell the Justice Department to do anything for any [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=415.82s)]
*  reason and it can never be reviewed for the life of that president? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=420.5s)]
*  Because if so, among other things, Richard Nixon would like his presidency back, please. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=427.5s)]
*  If everything that happens between a president and his Justice Department is absolutely immune [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=432.5s)]
*  from the criminal law, is absolutely immune from not only the prosecution but investigation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=439.5s)]
*  by the courts as a potentially criminal matter, that means that the president can do things [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=445.5s)]
*  with the Justice Department that—I mean, what's the limit? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=450.5s)]
*  My second question is about what happens next in that federal case, referenced there about [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=457.5s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=464.5s)]
*  The justices in the majority today, with Chief Justice Roberts writing for them, said explicitly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=466.5s)]
*  that they want portions of this case sent back to the district court. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=471.5s)]
*  So not the part that relates to Trump talking to Justice Department officials, but the part [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=476.5s)]
*  of it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=481.5s)]
*  They want those parts of the indictment sent back to the district court, meaning back to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=482.5s)]
*  Judge Tanya Chutkin's courtroom in Washington, D.C., essentially for her to determine in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=487.5s)]
*  her courtroom whether or not Trump's actions, as described in the indictment, were official [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=492.5s)]
*  and therefore immune or were they not official, which might mean that charges on those matters [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=498.5s)]
*  were not. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=503.5s)]
*  So I think that's the question. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=504.5s)]
*  Were they immune or were they not official, which might mean that charges on those matters [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=506.5s)]
*  can go ahead? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=511.5s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=513.5s)]
*  What are the justices saying should happen in Judge Chutkin's courtroom and when? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=515.5s)]
*  And what will that look like to an American public that really is actively considering [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=520.5s)]
*  right now whether to send this particular felon back to the White House, thanks to the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4DK-RilIg&t=525.5s)]
