# Anti-abortion GOP in Iowa takes radical turn with special cruelty to rape victims
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs)
*  Meanwhile, in news from Gilead, we're also going to be going live tonight to the governor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=0.0s)]
*  of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=6.84s)]
*  Maura Healey has just made a dramatic announcement in Massachusetts about what her state is doing, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=9.28s)]
*  what her state government is doing in response to the radical turn that the American political [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=14.32s)]
*  right has just taken on abortion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=20.68s)]
*  And I don't use the phrase radical turn there lightly or loosely. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean it really specifically and in a considered way. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=29.12s)]
*  As an example to support my choice of that phrase, I submit to you some of the current [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=32.92s)]
*  headlines right now in the great state of Iowa. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=41.24s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=43.68s)]
*  Des Moines Register. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=47.08s)]
*  Iowa stops paying for rape victims, mourning after pills and abortions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=48.36s)]
*  This is an actual headline from an actual American state that has actual American women [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=56.56s)]
*  living in it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=60.96s)]
*  Until now, if a woman, God forbid, was raped in the state of Iowa, she came forward to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=64.4s)]
*  the police to report that she had been raped, the law enforcement process would kick in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=69.48s)]
*  and she would be provided a medical examination without cost to her and care for her injuries [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=74.88s)]
*  and care for other potential consequences of her sexual assault, including preventive [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=81.64s)]
*  care for any sexually transmitted diseases, also emergency contraception to prevent any [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=87.44s)]
*  pregnancy occurring as a result of the rape. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=93.24s)]
*  Until recently, that was the standard. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=97.56s)]
*  Well Iowa now has a new Republican attorney general and under Republican rule in Iowa, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=100.2s)]
*  the state has decided they will no longer give you emergency contraception in this circumstance [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=106.12s)]
*  because as far as Republicans are concerned in Iowa, it's apparently their preference [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  that you be forced to bear the rapists baby now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  And this goes beyond even abortion. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  I mean this new Iowa policy under the Republican attorney general is not only that a rape victim [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=123.08s)]
*  will no longer be provided an abortion if she is impregnated in the course of a rape, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=128.38s)]
*  she will also not be provided emergency contraception. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=134.1s)]
*  Think about that for a second. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=139.64s)]
*  I mean, emergency contraception is not abortion. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=140.64s)]
*  Emergency contraception literally prevents a pregnancy from occurring if taken in the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  immediate aftermath of intercourse, including in this instance, rape. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  So for rape victims specifically, the fact that you have Republican governance in your [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=155.72s)]
*  state, that means that as of now, the state no longer wants to prevent a pregnancy from [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  occurring as the result of rape. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=166.1s)]
*  They want you to be forced to bear the pregnancy and the child against your will after you [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=168.16s)]
*  have been raped, even though it was it is within their power to stop that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  And before this policy change, the state regularly took steps to stop it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=179.64s)]
*  They are going to change that policy because they'd rather you bear that pregnancy and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=186.76s)]
*  the rapists baby against your will. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=191.68s)]
*  And it is the choice of Republicans and state government to insist upon that for you, despite [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=194.44s)]
*  what you want after you have been raped. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=199.24s)]
*  Iowa, a red state where still as a red state, 61 percent of the public wants abortion to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=202.96s)]
*  be legal in some or all cases. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=209.72s)]
*  Not only has the Republican government there now criminalized abortion, they are going [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=212.06s)]
*  after contraception and specifically targeting rape victims to start the targeting of contraception. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=216.28s)]
*  You cannot abort a pregnancy once it happens, even if it happens as a result of rape. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=223.76s)]
*  The state will no longer assist you with that as a rape victim, nor can you prevent a pregnancy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  from occurring by using emergency contraception. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=241.04s)]
*  The state will no longer will help you with that either. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=243.88s)]
*  And this, again, is not just something broad that they're doing for the whole, they're [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=246.16s)]
*  specifically targeting rape victims. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=249.32s)]
*  So like I said, the phrase radical turn here is a considered phrase. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=252.52s)]
*  I do not use it lightly. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nry5lK03qNs&t=255.84s)]
