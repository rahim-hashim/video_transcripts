# Snyder: Trump deference to Musk, Putin over U.S. public opinion is 'unsustainable'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk)
*  In northern Georgia, there's a town called Gainesville. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not Gainesville, Florida. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=3.0s)]
*  Gainesville, Georgia is small. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=4.5s)]
*  It's home to about 47,000 people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=6.0s)]
*  Gainesville is also home to a regional office of the Social Security Administration, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=9.0s)]
*  one of at least five Social Security offices in the state of Georgia [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=14.0s)]
*  that Donald Trump is trying to close, trying to get rid of. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=18.0s)]
*  But look at this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=22.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=23.0s)]
*  Local residents in Gainesville, Georgia just held as a protest a funeral [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=24.0s)]
*  for that Social Security office. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=29.0s)]
*  They showed up in downtown Gainesville. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=31.0s)]
*  They were all black, as if it was a funeral. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=33.0s)]
*  They held little coffins that said RIP Social Security. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=35.0s)]
*  They also focused the bulk of their attention and their rhyming skills [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=39.0s)]
*  on their local Republican congressman Andrew Clyde [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=44.0s)]
*  for his support for Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=47.0s)]
*  See signs like this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=50.0s)]
*  Clyde lies as Social Security dies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=51.0s)]
*  And KKK lied. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=54.0s)]
*  Doses while Social Security closes, spelling Clyde with three Ks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=57.0s)]
*  And yeah, this is a relatively small protest, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=62.0s)]
*  but Gainesville, Georgia is a relatively small town. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=66.0s)]
*  The opposition to Trump is turning up in surprising places, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=70.0s)]
*  in places that are doing it in their own totally independent, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=74.0s)]
*  moving and creative ways. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=78.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=81.0s)]
*  He's the author of On Freedom and On Tyranny. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=83.0s)]
*  He's the Richard C. Levin Professor of History at Yale University. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=85.0s)]
*  Tim, Professor Snyder, it's really nice of you to make time to be here tonight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=89.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=92.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=93.0s)]
*  There's a lot that's going on that I want to talk to you about, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=95.0s)]
*  but I wanted to ask you now that we are this many weeks into it, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=97.0s)]
*  what you make of the character of the opposition [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=102.0s)]
*  that we are seeing right now to Trump's presidency. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=105.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=108.0s)]
*  I think on the one side, we have too few Democrats [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=110.0s)]
*  who are articulate in describing the world as it actually is unfolding before our eyes, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=114.0s)]
*  but we have a few who are doing an excellent job. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=120.0s)]
*  And on the other side, we have creative local opposition all throughout the country, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=123.0s)]
*  probably more than we see, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=129.0s)]
*  because unfortunately we don't have enough local reporters to cover all of this properly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=131.0s)]
*  What we're going to see, I think, in months to come [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=135.0s)]
*  is those two things moving slowly to each other [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=138.0s)]
*  as these creative protests create platforms [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=141.0s)]
*  for the more adventurous and charismatic politicians. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=144.0s)]
*  What impact does opposition like this have, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=148.0s)]
*  and where do you watch for signs of its impact? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=152.0s)]
*  It's absolutely of the first importance, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=156.0s)]
*  because when strange things happen and nobody reacts, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=159.0s)]
*  then everybody normalizes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=163.0s)]
*  But if strange things happen and a few people react, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=165.0s)]
*  or even more than a few people react, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=168.0s)]
*  then people can say, yeah, you know, maybe I wouldn't protest myself, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=170.0s)]
*  but there sure is a strange thing that's happening. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=174.0s)]
*  And then when another strange thing happens, they might actually protest. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=176.0s)]
*  So getting out there, showing your face, being with other people, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=180.0s)]
*  being creative, making up slogans and signs, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=183.0s)]
*  all of that is really important because it arrests people's imagination. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=186.0s)]
*  It helps them stop and think and say, wait, this is in fact strange, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=190.0s)]
*  because other people think it's strange, and maybe next time I'll join in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=194.0s)]
*  One of the things that I have been sort of watching and not knowing what to do with, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=198.0s)]
*  and I've been wanting to talk to you about it, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=203.0s)]
*  is this very, very, very strong set of signals and public opinion polling [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=205.0s)]
*  from the American public about Russia, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=210.0s)]
*  about disfavoring Vladimir Putin, disfavoring Russia under Putin, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=213.0s)]
*  strongly siding with Ukraine over Russia in the Russia-Ukraine war. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=218.0s)]
*  At so many of these protests, even in small towns and in red districts and all, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=223.0s)]
*  unexpected places all over the country, you're seeing people with Ukraine flags [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=227.0s)]
*  and people making that a central point of the way they're protesting. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=231.0s)]
*  You saw it in the protest against JD Vance. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=236.0s)]
*  Go ski in Russia, you traitor. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=238.0s)]
*  It seems to be really an animating thing for the American people, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=240.0s)]
*  even though I feel like the punditocracy has been telling us for a long time [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=244.0s)]
*  that Americans don't care about anything beyond our borders. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=247.0s)]
*  What do you make of that, and what do you think the clash ultimately will be [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=250.0s)]
*  between the American public having such a clear, strong, immutable opinion on that matter [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=259.0s)]
*  and the behavior of President Trump? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=264.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think Ukraine-Russia is an area where a lot of Americans just show a lot of common sense. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=267.0s)]
*  People know who invaded whom, and people have a sense that invasions are wrong, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=271.0s)]
*  and people know that war crimes are wrong. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=276.0s)]
*  People know that it's wrong to be tortured, to have children kidnapped, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=279.0s)]
*  to have local leaders executed, to have all these things happen. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=283.0s)]
*  People have righteous common sense about these things, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=286.0s)]
*  and I think Ukraine is a resonant for American protesters for a couple of reasons. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=288.0s)]
*  The first is that it involves people going out and being courageous. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=292.0s)]
*  It involves people taking a stand for values like freedom, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=297.0s)]
*  and people think, well, if they can do it, then we can do it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=301.0s)]
*  But another thing which is important is that Ukraine is about reality. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=305.0s)]
*  It's about something which is actually happening, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=308.0s)]
*  whereas so much that we're being fed by this administration has to do with unreality, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=310.0s)]
*  with stuff which is made up, with lies, big, little and small, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=314.0s)]
*  and I think it's refreshing for people to say, well, wait, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=318.0s)]
*  there are people who are living in reality. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=320.0s)]
*  As far as the disjuncture with popular opinions concerned, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=323.0s)]
*  I was thinking about that during your segment, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=325.0s)]
*  and it strikes me that I can't think of any example in history [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=327.0s)]
*  where an American leader has been so entranced for such a long period by any foreigner, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=331.0s)]
*  let alone a foreign leader who's obviously an extreme right-wing dictator [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=337.0s)]
*  carrying out a war of aggression. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=340.0s)]
*  There is something deeply strange about that, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=343.0s)]
*  and I think unsustainable for the reason you're putting your finger on. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=345.0s)]
*  It's very undemocratic. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=348.0s)]
*  Trump acts as though his only constituents were Musk and Putin, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=350.0s)]
*  and no one else really matters, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=355.0s)]
*  and I think with time people are going to realize that, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=357.0s)]
*  that Trump is acting like those two men are his constituents, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=360.0s)]
*  and no one else really matters. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=363.0s)]
*  Crucial point, and I think that's exactly right. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=365.0s)]
*  We have seen things in history, in bad points in American history, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=369.0s)]
*  where we've had leaders, influential people, even electeds, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=373.0s)]
*  who have been entranced by foreign dictators, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=375.0s)]
*  but the idea of how they would pursue that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=378.0s)]
*  is that they would try to persuade Americans to come along with them in that affection. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=383.0s)]
*  They would try to persuade Americans to also be entranced by that foreign dictator. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=387.0s)]
*  In this case, that couldn't be further from the truth. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=392.0s)]
*  It seems to be a personal connection. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=395.0s)]
*  Timothy Snyder, I knew you'd know. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=399.0s)]
*  Professor of history at Yale University, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=402.0s)]
*  I'd love to have you back soon. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=405.0s)]
*  Anytime. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhvMcUDlpk&t=407.0s)]
