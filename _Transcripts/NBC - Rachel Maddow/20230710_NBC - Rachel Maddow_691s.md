# Tennessee A.G. uses private medical records in Republican campaign against trans people
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8)
*  You might have seen over the weekend that there was a weekend ruling from a federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=0.0s)]
*  appeals court in Tennessee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=4.72s)]
*  Tennessee Republicans have been going after trans people every way they can. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=6.5s)]
*  A federal appeals court this weekend on Saturday in a divided two-to-one decision let that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=10.56s)]
*  state go forward with banning specific kinds of health care for trans people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=17.04s)]
*  And this is not some distant threat or something that's kind of locked up in the courts now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  Thanks to that appeals court ruling, again on Saturday this weekend, for people under [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=27.28s)]
*  the age of 18, that ruling this weekend means whatever ongoing health care they have been [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=32.4s)]
*  getting in Tennessee, it is now officially illegal. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=36.64s)]
*  That ruling went into effect immediately. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=39.84s)]
*  Any such health care, ongoing health care that you've previously been receiving, has [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  to stop immediately. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=46.38s)]
*  But that's also happening in the context of this other thing that Republicans are doing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=50.86s)]
*  in the state of Tennessee that I do think puts them sort of at the front of the line [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=54.459999999999994s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=58.14s)]
*  The Republican state attorney general in Tennessee is using his office to obtain the private [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=59.66s)]
*  medical records, unredacted full medical records, for patients who have had care at a particular [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=65.72s)]
*  clinic in Tennessee at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=71.78s)]
*  He's using his office as attorney general to take people's individual private unredacted [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=76.0s)]
*  medical records for the purposes of an investigation in his state attorney general's office. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=82.78s)]
*  Now Vanderbilt University Medical Center says that they had no choice but to hand over these [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  records after the attorney general demanded them, but they also didn't notify their patients [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=94.38s)]
*  that they had handed over their records until after they had already started handing them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=99.06s)]
*  in. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  In other words, Vanderbilt presumably could have told their patients, we've received this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  demand from the attorney general's office, we don't want to comply, but we think we're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  going to have to, we want to let you know before we give them your records. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=112.06s)]
*  That's not the way it went apparently. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=117.94s)]
*  Vanderbilt University Medical Center reportedly started handing over the records in response [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=119.42s)]
*  to the attorney general's demands months ago and just recently let their patients know [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=125.34s)]
*  that those records have been given. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=131.26s)]
*  So according to reporting in the Tennessean newspaper, the attorney general has taken [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=133.96s)]
*  people's medical records. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=140.34s)]
*  He's also taken information on people who volunteer at this particular clinic. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=141.7s)]
*  He's also taken information on anyone who has written in with a question about LGBTQ [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=145.78s)]
*  healthcare using a website that was set up to field queries on that topic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=151.62s)]
*  He's even taken the names of people who were referred to that clinic at Vanderbilt, even [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  if those people never actually got care there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=164.06s)]
*  The attorney general's office has collected all this information, apparently demanded [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=166.78s)]
*  all these records going back to 2018 and now they've got them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=171.34s)]
*  Now years ago we covered a similar case, at least a case with echoes of this in Kansas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=177.9s)]
*  You might remember this story. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=184.34s)]
*  A Republican attorney general there named Phil Klein used the power of his office to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=185.62s)]
*  get individual medical records of women who had been to an abortion clinic in the state [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=190.86s)]
*  of Kansas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=195.26s)]
*  He and his staff took women's medical records, private medical records, unredacted medical [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=196.26s)]
*  records, took them, used the power of their office to get them from the clinic, then copied [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=200.82s)]
*  them, kept them in totally insecure containers and car trunks in people's garages, trucked [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  them around the state, reportedly left some of them at a Kinko's copy shop at one point. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  These are personal, individual, private medical records dealing with the most sensitive possible [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=217.38s)]
*  medical information. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=222.78s)]
*  The attorney general who did that in Kansas was an anti-abortion activist who Republicans [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=225.54s)]
*  elected to be their state attorney general. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=230.42s)]
*  His name was Phil Klein. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  He ended up having his law license permanently suspended for doing that about 10 years ago. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  But now here's the Tennessee Republican attorney general using a page out of the same playbook [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=239.7s)]
*  now, demanding and getting unredacted, complete, private medical records for trans people in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=245.1s)]
*  Tennessee as Republicans use every tool they've got to try to make life miserable for trans [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  people and their families in that state. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=260.02000000000004s)]
*  Attorney Chase Strangio is the deputy director for transgender justice at the ACLU nationwide. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=264.26s)]
*  The ACLU is suing the state of Tennessee over the ban on care for trans youth in that state. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=270.06s)]
*  Chase Strangio tells us tonight, quote, When you have this type of aggressive investigation [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=276.06s)]
*  from an attorney general combined with legislation, not only does it limit the care that's available, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=280.1s)]
*  it also chills the provision of care more generally. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=285.26s)]
*  Doctors are less inclined to provide it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=288.06s)]
*  Hospitals are less inclined to teach it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=290.06s)]
*  Families, if there's a threat of violence or my kids' records could be exposed, I'm [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=291.74s)]
*  out of there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=295.98s)]
*  You have this dynamic in which care is not only being banned, it's also being chilled [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=296.98s)]
*  prospectively. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=301.62s)]
*  And that will have an effect for generations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=303.58s)]
*  Margaret Renkel is a journalist who lives in Nashville. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=307.98s)]
*  She wrote this about this situation in Tennessee for the New York Times. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=311.3s)]
*  She says, quote, Tell me this isn't a witch hunt. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=315.02s)]
*  Tell me this isn't an open campaign of terror against already vulnerable citizens who had [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=318.46s)]
*  every reason to believe that their medical records, their medical records were confidential [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  and every reason to believe that the medical clinic of a major university hospital was [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=329.26s)]
*  a safe space. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=333.9s)]
*  Joining us now is Ali Chapman. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=337.21999999999997s)]
*  She leads a local chapter of the Tennessee Equality Project. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=338.9s)]
*  She's got a master's degree in science and another in public health. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  She's also the mom of a transgender son who received care at Vanderbilt, which is the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=344.3s)]
*  medical center that's just been forced to hand over patient medical records to the state's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=349.62s)]
*  Republican attorney general. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  Ms. Chapman, I really want to thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=355.06s)]
*  It should not take bravery to speak out publicly on an issue like this, but I know particularly [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=358.3s)]
*  in your state right now it does. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=363.02s)]
*  And so I'm really grateful that you're here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=364.42s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=366.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=367.42s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if I if I got any of that wrong or if there's anything that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=368.42s)]
*  important that I'm missing about what's going on with this sort of twin nightmare in Tennessee [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=374.3s)]
*  right now with the legislation that's affecting trans people and their families and also the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=379.94s)]
*  situation with with private medical records being being taken by the state attorney general. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=385.14000000000004s)]
*  It's really complicated and just infuriating because it doesn't need to be this complicated. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=391.22s)]
*  It doesn't need to be invasive. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=397.14000000000004s)]
*  And you know, the issue that we have is they've not only violated the trust of patients and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=399.98s)]
*  doctors as an institution, but Vanderbilt has demonstrated their willingness to share [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=406.26s)]
*  records when they've been compelled by the state for what I would say would be any reason. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=413.18s)]
*  So I think this is telling for people who would also be concerned about reproductive [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=418.66s)]
*  rights, just health care in general. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=422.1s)]
*  And while we were waiting and hoping on the courts to be reasonable and make common sense [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=425.1s)]
*  rules rulings, we know common sense is only common for those who have experienced the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  same things. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  And the reality is most of the people in the state of Tennessee have not interacted with [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  or know trans kids or their families. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=445.18s)]
*  So there's a lot of misinformation that's showing up shows up in the rulings and the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=447.82000000000005s)]
*  way that they're being written by the judges. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  It shows up in the debates. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=454.3s)]
*  It shows up in the arguments and the conversations and the hate speech that's happening through [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=455.58s)]
*  bad actors like Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=462.58s)]
*  On that point about common understanding and common sense, and I would add maybe common [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=468.14s)]
*  decency, I feel like as trans people and their families have been attacked and have been [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=474.74s)]
*  demonized and as people, as you mentioned, people in conservative media, conservative [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=481.26000000000005s)]
*  social media have really decided that this is a meal ticket for them to attack this particular [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=485.98s)]
*  population in increasingly intense ways. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  I feel like there's a lot of differences of opinions. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=495.02000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of heat on this issue. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=499.18s)]
*  But one thing I feel like where people don't have to imagine a different kind of life, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=500.74s)]
*  they don't need to put themselves in somebody else's shoes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=505.26000000000005s)]
*  They can just think about this through their own experience is private medical records [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=507.26000000000005s)]
*  being taken by law enforcement and in particular in this case with the medical center saying [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=510.86s)]
*  it was compelled, it had no choice but to hand them over, but not letting patients know [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=516.7s)]
*  until after they had already handed them over. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=520.34s)]
*  I have to imagine, at least I have to hope that there's some empathetic reaction among [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=522.66s)]
*  other Tennesseans that private medical records should at least stay private, that that part [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=527.94s)]
*  of this has to feel over the line to people who maybe otherwise don't see themselves [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=532.34s)]
*  as allies on this issue. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=537.58s)]
*  Even among our allies, there's still a lot of confusion and misunderstanding. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=540.9s)]
*  And you nailed it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=547.94s)]
*  We really need to be talking about common decency, fineness and empathy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=549.5s)]
*  And that's not what we're seeing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=554.34s)]
*  And so we're fighting both. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=556.34s)]
*  We're fighting an argument when it comes to science and biology, which most people don't [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=558.26s)]
*  understand from a third grade level. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=562.78s)]
*  Or are we talking about collectively the personhood of someone? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=565.46s)]
*  And that's what I really like to focus on when I'm talking about children specifically [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=569.66s)]
*  is these are human beings with lives. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=573.42s)]
*  That's who I'm focused on. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=576.2199999999999s)]
*  And when I try to engage in conversations with people who still at this point don't [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=578.06s)]
*  understand, I think that's really challenging because it takes up a lot of energy and time [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=583.26s)]
*  and distracts people from what we're trying to do, which is to protect trans kids. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=589.9399999999999s)]
*  We do not want the state and we do not want the attorney general's scrimmety. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=595.54s)]
*  And we don't want the governor in their positions of power to abuse in a way that threatens [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  these kids because that's the reality of it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  And something I try to explain to people, you know, in my case and knowing other supportive [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=608.9799999999999s)]
*  parents, you're faced with a choice. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=613.4599999999999s)]
*  If you support your child, you're looking at hopefully a brighter future for them and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=616.3399999999999s)]
*  discovering what that means along the way. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=622.0999999999999s)]
*  If you choose not to accept them, if you choose to push them to the margins and allow [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=624.38s)]
*  people to push them to the margins and you give in, you're faced with two results. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=629.46s)]
*  One is you never see your children again. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=636.26s)]
*  The second is they die. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=638.46s)]
*  And people like to say that this is a hyperbolic statement. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=640.06s)]
*  It is not. I know children who have died of suicide in the last few years and the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=643.18s)]
*  political rhetoric and just, you know, the conversation is so harmful. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=648.74s)]
*  It is so very, very hard. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=653.62s)]
*  And we need the backing of our leaders and people in positions of power. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=655.58s)]
*  And we just do not have that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=660.0600000000001s)]
*  Need the backing of leadership. You also need allies among other people in your state, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  whether or not they see themselves as as directly affected. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfnoV9nIu8&t=667.38s)]
