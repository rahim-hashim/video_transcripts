# Madeleine Albright, First Woman Secretary Of State, Dies At 84
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0)
*  Now, Poland became a member of NATO in 1999. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=0.0s)]
*  And 1999 is relevant because that year the alliance was faced with another crisis that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=4.24s)]
*  was beyond its borders. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Less than two weeks after Poland joined NATO, NATO began a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=13.16s)]
*  with the goal of getting the Serbian ruler Slobodan Milosevic to pull his forces out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=19.72s)]
*  of neighboring Kosovo, where he was massacring Kosovo Albanians in a campaign of ethnic cleansing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=24.56s)]
*  And it was right in the middle of that bombing campaign and ongoing negotiations to try to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=31.36s)]
*  strike a deal with Milosevic that this happened. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=36.94s)]
*  Now the war over Kosovo and the dramatic development that was formally announced today, Slobodan [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=41.76s)]
*  Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal by the international tribunal in The Hague. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=46.8s)]
*  Milosevic and four of his top lieutenants are charged with the mass murder of 340 Kosovo [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=52.32s)]
*  Albanians, the deportation of 740,000, and still more charges are likely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=57.2s)]
*  But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright suggests instead of dealing with Milosevic, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=63.2s)]
*  he should be removed from power to stand trial before the world court in The Hague. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  We have made clear that we would not go for any kind of immunity. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=71.8s)]
*  Now that was the first time in history that a head of state had been indicted for war [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=79.56s)]
*  crimes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=85.28s)]
*  And U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Milosevic would face justice, no immunity [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=86.28s)]
*  deals. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  She would go on to institute a policy of withholding U.S. aid to Yugoslavia unless they handed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  over Milosevic for prosecution, a strategy which ultimately worked. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=98.84s)]
*  Slobodan Milosevic was extradited to The Hague in 2001. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=104.16s)]
*  When he died in 2006, his trial on charges of genocide was ongoing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=108.88s)]
*  Madeleine Albright, America's first female Secretary of State, was herself a child of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=114.28s)]
*  European strife. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=118.84s)]
*  Born in Czechoslovakia in 1937, her family fled the country twice, first from the Nazis, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=120.56s)]
*  then from the Soviets. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=128.16s)]
*  Just a couple of days after Milosevic was indicted, Albright delivered a commencement [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=130.12s)]
*  address at Georgetown University and said this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=133.76s)]
*  The great lesson of this century is that when aggression and brutality go unopposed, like [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=138.84s)]
*  a cancer they spread. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=145.32s)]
*  And what begins as a treatable sickness in one part of the body can rapidly endanger [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  the whole. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=152.68s)]
*  That was 1999. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=156.88s)]
*  The very end of the century she was describing and the implicit hope was that by learning [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=158.4s)]
*  the lessons of the 20th century, its horrors could be avoided in the 21st. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=163.36s)]
*  Madeleine Albright died today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  She was 84 years old. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=171.52s)]
*  Flags have been lowered to half staff at the White House in her honor and her death comes [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  on the day that the U.S. President is arriving in a Europe once again facing war to meet [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=176.96s)]
*  with NATO leaders facing their greatest crisis in decades. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9DW_bbvNJ0&t=182.96s)]
