# Trump seeks to use Supreme Court immunity ruling to delay sentencing for New York felonies
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q)
*  All right, we've got a bunch of stuff to cover tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  First, the former president of the United States is going to be sentenced for 34 felony [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=2.9s)]
*  convictions next week, on Thursday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=7.62s)]
*  The prosecutors who brought that case and who prosecuted in court that case against [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=10.86s)]
*  Donald Trump, they were due today to make their sentencing recommendation to the judge. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=15.94s)]
*  In a New York state case like this, it's not the jury that convicted Trump that will [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=23.94s)]
*  decide what his sentence is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=29.22s)]
*  It's the judge who oversaw the case. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=30.66s)]
*  It's Judge Juan Marchand who will sentence Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=32.68s)]
*  The maximum sentence under law that Trump could face is four years in prison. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=35.58s)]
*  It's very possible, however, that he might not get any prison time at all. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=40.82s)]
*  Or if he does get a sentence of confinement, it's possible it could be home confinement. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=44.22s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  On the one hand, what he's been convicted of, while it is 34 felonies, it's a nonviolent [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  crime. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=56.14s)]
*  And also, he's a first-time offender. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=57.5s)]
*  He's never been convicted of anything before. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=59.38s)]
*  Those would certainly cut against him getting any significant jail time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=61.78s)]
*  On the other hand, he does have three other major felony criminal cases pending against [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=66.62s)]
*  him at this moment. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=71.54s)]
*  He was fined by this judge for multiple violations of the court order in this case that required [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  him to restrain himself from speaking about jurors and witnesses and court staff and the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=78.1s)]
*  families of the judge and the lawyers in this case. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=82.9s)]
*  He's also shown absolutely no remorse whatsoever, which is the thing that judges are supposed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=86.66000000000001s)]
*  to consider. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  So all of those factors serve as sort of aggravating context. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=92.54s)]
*  Those might cut in favor of him getting jail time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=97.34s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=100.86000000000001s)]
*  This is why a person with the job title judge makes a decision like this and not randos [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  like you or me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=108.5s)]
*  Before the sentencing, the judge will get three pieces of advice, essentially, to help [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=111.56s)]
*  him make his decision. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=116.72s)]
*  He will get a not public-facing confidential recommendation on Trump's proposed sentence [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  from the probation department. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=126.22s)]
*  He will also get a sentencing recommendation from Trump's own lawyers, which presumably [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=128.24s)]
*  will be that he should get a cookie and a nice bag of treats, because he's a good boy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  And presumably he will also get the sentencing recommendation from prosecutors as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=138.2s)]
*  There is no rule about whether or not the prosecutor's sentencing recommendation is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  made public, either before the sentencing or during the sentencing or after. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  That is all up to Judge Marshawn as to whether he tells us what the prosecutors are asking for. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  But I can also tell you tonight that it is not totally clear when the judge is going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  to get that sentencing recommendation from prosecutors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  It was due in today, but then something happened today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=165.2s)]
*  Immediately following today's seismic Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, Trump's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=170.48s)]
*  lawyers asked the judge, advised the judge in the New York criminal case, that they are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=176.56s)]
*  going to ask him formally, they're going to file a motion asking him essentially to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  set aside Trump's guilty verdict, despite the jury's verdict in that case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=187.48s)]
*  After the defense, after Trump's lawyers notified the judge that they were going to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=194.04s)]
*  ask him to set aside the verdict, prosecutors then didn't send in their sentencing recommendations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=201.7s)]
*  as they had been expected to do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=208.0s)]
*  Now, as far as we know, the sentencing is still on. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=210.6s)]
*  But there is an element of uncertainty now as to what kind of a hitch this might be in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  finishing up this criminal case in which Trump has already been convicted. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=219.76s)]
*  We can report tonight that Trump's lawyers have asked that the sentencing itself be delayed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=224.6s)]
*  And we expect that Judge Marshawn will consider delaying the sentence after he gets both that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=232.14s)]
*  request from Trump's lawyers, but also after he hears from the prosecutors on that matter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=239.0s)]
*  Now that prosecutors have delayed submitting their sentencing recommendations, does that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=245.54s)]
*  mean the sentencing itself will be delayed? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=250.48s)]
*  Does that mean anything else material in terms of the sentence that Trump will likely face [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  or when he will hear about it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=256.78s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=259.3s)]
*  We are waiting to hear from Judge Marshawn. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0f9PIsrH5Q&t=260.3s)]
