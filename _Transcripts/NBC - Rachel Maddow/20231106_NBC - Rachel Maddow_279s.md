# Report paints ominous picture of early days of planned second Trump term
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4)
*  I thought I was sort of past being shocked. I will admit I found this legitimately shocking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, Donald Trump and his allies are drafting plans to potentially invoke the Insurrection Act [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=4.72s)]
*  on his first day in office to allow him to deploy the military against civil demonstrations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=10.8s)]
*  Quote, dubbed Project 2025, the group is developing a plan to include draft executive orders that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=17.52s)]
*  would deploy the U.S. military domestically under the Insurrection Act. The proposal is [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=23.76s)]
*  identified in internal discussions as an immediate priority. The guy reportedly leading the work on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=29.6s)]
*  this Insurrection Act plan under Project 2025 is Jeffrey Clark, a Trump Justice Department official [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  who proposed having DOJ endorse fake fraud claims to effectively tell the states that they should [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=41.92s)]
*  ignore election results and keep Trump in power. According to Trump's federal indictment, he [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  allegedly favored using the Insurrection Act back then to use the U.S. military to keep Trump in power. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=53.44s)]
*  Now I should note that a spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation, which is organizing this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=60.96s)]
*  Project 2025, is denying the existence of this Insurrection Act plan. But it is part of one of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  this, it's part of one of this, this fairly shocking set of new reporting from Isaac Arnstorf, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett just out at the Washington Post. Joining us now is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=78.48s)]
*  Washington Post National Security reporter Devlin Barrett. Devlin, it's nice to see you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=83.12s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here tonight. Thanks for having me. So I have to ask you, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=86.48s)]
*  in light of the Heritage Foundation denying the Insurrection Act part of this reporting, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=90.56s)]
*  I just have to ask you if you stand by your reporting and what you make of that denial. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=96.0s)]
*  Well, absolutely. I mean, look, here's the weird dynamic that the Insurrection Act has played [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  not just this year, but for a number of years now, which is that starting around mid-2020, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=107.44s)]
*  there were a lot of people who tried to convince Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to put down [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  protests against police, protests against his administration, any number of things that they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=120.0s)]
*  didn't like going on in the public square. So now what you have is a number of folks sort of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=125.2s)]
*  mapping out what they would like a second Trump administration to look like. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  And one of the things they would like to see is the use of the Insurrection Act to put down [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=136.08s)]
*  any protests. That is a, let's face it, fairly theoretical conversation at this point. There [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=140.72s)]
*  is no second Trump administration yet. There is no, you know, set of public protests to put down. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=146.56s)]
*  But I think it says a lot about the way conservatives are talking about what a second [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=153.12s)]
*  Trump administration would look like, that one of the things that is right on the table right away [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=159.84s)]
*  is the Insurrection Act. Yeah, the timing and it being there right away is the part of it that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=164.64s)]
*  really has stuck with me. I mean, if there aren't big civil demonstrations to put down, right, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  which is the theoretical justification for something like the Insurrection Act, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  is that your understanding that they're preparing these executive orders, they're preparing these [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=179.2s)]
*  potential actions, essentially to invoke the Insurrection Act as soon as he's president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=182.72s)]
*  So it's there as a proverbial loaded gun for him to use whenever he feels like it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=187.76s)]
*  rather than expecting it to have to be reactive to something that they're anticipating actually [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=192.32s)]
*  happening in the country. Sure. But I think there's one word of caution here to understand, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  which is that this is what some folks around Trump and some folks who hope to be part of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=202.64s)]
*  this second Trump administration would like to see happen. That doesn't necessarily mean that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=208.16s)]
*  Trump has adopted these things, that Trump already wants to do these things. I think one of the big [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=213.44s)]
*  conversations going on in conservative circles right now as we speak, and this is a big part of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=218.72s)]
*  what we were trying to report on and explain, is that there's a lot of conservatives, including [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=224.56s)]
*  conservative lawyers, who are trying to argue out like what should their role, if any, be in a second [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=228.96s)]
*  Trump administration? Because increasingly it looks like he will be the nominee. So there's a lot of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=235.28s)]
*  Republicans who have to make choices right now. And this is part of the discussion of those choices. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=240.24s)]
*  Yeah. The legal profession has some choices to make too, in terms of its own professional [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=246.08s)]
*  responsibilities. Washington Post National Security reporter Devlin Barrett. This is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=250.56s)]
*  chilling and fascinating reporting. Thanks for helping us understand it. Thanks for having me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ADS72l4tl4&t=276.08s)]
