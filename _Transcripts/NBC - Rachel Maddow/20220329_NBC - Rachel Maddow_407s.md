# 'No Good Explanation' For Gap In Record Of Trump Calls On January 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE)
*  On November 8th, 1973, the top story leading the news was the high stakes diplomatic peace [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=0.0s)]
*  talks happening between two nations at war. Israel and Egypt, who were meeting for initial [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=5.76s)]
*  negotiations to try to end the Yom Kippur War, was a huge deal. The war had claimed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=10.96s)]
*  thousands of lives by that point. The peace talks led the news that night ahead of another [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  historic domestic crisis that was playing out before the American public. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  The Watergate special prosecutors today finally found a significant discrepancy. The discrepancy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=26.0s)]
*  strongly suggested that someone interrupted the automatic White House recording system [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=33.76s)]
*  in the hours immediately before or after important conversations between the president and John Dean. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  The Watergate special prosecutors described the inconsistency between the White House [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  logs and the automatic recording equipment as unexplained and substantial. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=50.08s)]
*  The Watergate missing tapes, 18 and a half minutes of conversations between the president and his [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=56.96s)]
*  advisors that mysteriously went missing during the Watergate investigation. President Nixon would [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=62.08s)]
*  eventually blame the missing tapes on his secretary, Rosemary Woods. Nixon's secretary played along and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=67.84s)]
*  even tried to physically demonstrate how she might have deleted the recordings to an incredulous press [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=74.0s)]
*  who dubbed her explanation the Rosemary stretch. It was missing 18 and a half minutes would become [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=79.28s)]
*  an infamous and enduring part of the Watergate cover-up for years to come. Now today as Russia [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=85.6s)]
*  and Ukraine engage in peace talks, none other than Watergate reporter Bob Woodward and his reporting [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  partner Bob Costa broke a new story about missing Trump White House records. Here's the headline [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=98.72s)]
*  from the Washington Post quote, January 6th White House logs given to House show seven hour gap in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  Trump calls. Washington Post reports that records of Trump's phone calls turned over to January 6th [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=112.0s)]
*  investigators have a seven hour and 37 minute gap from just before the insurrection started [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=117.76s)]
*  until right around the time the police started clearing the Capitol. The records that do exist [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=125.44s)]
*  show Trump called at least eight people in the first two and a half hours of his morning and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=131.44s)]
*  another 11 people in the evening on January 6th but from roughly 11 a.m. to nearly 7 p.m. as the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=135.84s)]
*  Capitol was being attacked, nothing. The Washington Post reports that the January 6th investigation [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=143.76s)]
*  quote is now investigating whether Trump communicated that day through back channels, phones or of aids [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=150.32s)]
*  or personal disposable phones known as burner phones end quote. The committee is also scrutinizing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=157.12s)]
*  whether it received the full logs from that day with one lawmaker on the panel saying the committee [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=164.24s)]
*  is investigating a possible cover-up of the official White House record. Joining us now, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Dan Goldman, former assistant United States attorney, former majority counsel during Donald [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=175.12s)]
*  Trump's first impeachment trial. Dan, good to see you tonight. How big a deal is this, this nearly [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=179.84s)]
*  eight hour gap in White House call records on the day of the attack? Do they indicate a likely [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=185.28s)]
*  cover-up and is there a way for the investigators to actually figure out what happened in that time [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=191.28s)]
*  and get those records? Well it certainly indicates something nefarious because either [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=196.08s)]
*  the Trump administration concealed the logs, erased them or did not include them when they turned over [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=203.12s)]
*  presidential records to the National Archives which is where the January 6th committee got the logs [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=210.48s)]
*  from or it means that he was trying to avoid a record of the phone calls that he was making [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=216.0s)]
*  during the insurrection so there's no real good possible explanation for him. We do know though [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=224.72s)]
*  that he made phone calls during that time. We know that he called Senator Tommy Tupperville but used [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=231.92s)]
*  called on Mike Lee, Senator Mike Lee's phone. We know that he spoke to Kevin McCarthy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=237.92s)]
*  after the rioters bombarded the Capitol so we know that there were phone calls and the way that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=245.04s)]
*  the January 6th committee can try to sort of reverse engineer what occurred that day is through [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=253.6s)]
*  other witnesses and other phone records and they can analyze those phone records that they've gotten [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=260.0s)]
*  some of which are subject to litigation right now but others I'm sure that they have and try to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=266.88s)]
*  determine who these those other people were talking to and whether they were speaking with [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=271.76s)]
*  Donald Trump. They can also match that up with testimony from other witnesses who might have said [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=277.68s)]
*  that they spoke to Trump on that day so there are ways of figuring it out but it is certainly an [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=284.08s)]
*  alarming and very conspicuous absence of information. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=289.52s)]
*  So in response to today's report Donald Trump claimed he didn't even know what a burner phone [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  was. Now the former Trump official John Bolton has already rebutted that today saying that the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=301.28s)]
*  president spoke about burner phones apparently all the time. Can the committee subpoena something [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=306.4s)]
*  like burner phone records? Do things like that exist? No that's the whole point of a burner phone. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=312.0s)]
*  They're often used by drug dealers and mobsters to evade detection. They're bought in other [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=319.2s)]
*  they're prepaid phones essentially that don't require you to give truthful identification [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=326.4s)]
*  information. You can go into any store and just buy a prepaid phone for 30 days or a certain number [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=333.04s)]
*  of minutes and you don't have to give any information and so that's why criminals use them is they're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=339.2s)]
*  really not traceable and you can't figure out who is talking on them unless you get someone on the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=344.08s)]
*  other end of the phone who says oh yeah this number that I called was you know Joe Schmoe and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=351.76s)]
*  that's how you can figure it out. So burner phones are widely used by criminal enterprises so that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=357.44s)]
*  a record of phone calls does not exist. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  Dan Goldman you and I have had some weird conversations over the years but talking about a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  president using a burner phone definitely is somewhere close to the top of the list. Good to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  see you my friend. Dan Goldman is a former assistant United States attorney and former [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  majority counsel in the first impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QHU1k0JDE&t=380.64s)]
