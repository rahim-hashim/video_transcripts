# 'This is what they do': U.S. sees familiar pattern of authoritarian attack on the media
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs)
*  In 2021, the Nobel Peace Prize was given to two journalists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=0.0s)]
*  One of them was this man, the editor-in-chief of a newspaper called Novaya Gazeta. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=5.04s)]
*  Novaya Gazeta was probably the most important national newspaper in Russia that was independent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=8.76s)]
*  and critical of the Kremlin. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=13.72s)]
*  Since Vladimir Putin has been the leader of Russia, at least six journalists from Novaya [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=15.8s)]
*  Gazeta have been murdered under mysterious circumstances, including their star investigative [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=20.0s)]
*  reporter Anna Polikovskaya, who was murdered in her apartment building in 2006 on Vladimir [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=25.08s)]
*  Putin's birthday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=31.64s)]
*  Novaya Gazeta's editor, Dmitry Muratov, was one of two people who was awarded the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prize in 2021. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=38.9s)]
*  Shortly thereafter, under threat of having the whole staff of the newspaper arrested, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=40.84s)]
*  Novaya Gazeta was forced to stop its print edition and move its operations out of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=45.84s)]
*  country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, the editor himself, again, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=52.63999999999999s)]
*  officially declared a foreign agent in Russia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=57.76s)]
*  He's not foreign, he's Russian. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  But declaring him a foreign agent makes it essentially a crime for anybody in Russia [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=63.72s)]
*  to work with him in any way, and it likely means they will be trying to jail him as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=68.52s)]
*  I mentioned that he was one of two people that got the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=74.08s)]
*  The other person, the person he shared it with, is this journalist. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=78.12s)]
*  Her name is Maria Ressa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=81.12s)]
*  Maria Ressa was raised in New Jersey. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=82.44s)]
*  She went to Princeton. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=84.84s)]
*  She's brilliant. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=85.84s)]
*  She was a bureau chief for CNN for a long time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  Maria Ressa ended up founding an independent, modern, critical news organization in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  Philippines called Rappler. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  And when the Philippines got Rodrigo Duterte as the de facto dictator of that country, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  the same year that we got Donald Trump, soon after, Maria Ressa found herself arrested [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  and jailed and charged with multiple crimes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=110.56s)]
*  She won that Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, along with the editor from Novaya Gazeta in Russia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  And soon after she won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Philippine government ordered Rappler, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  her news organization, shut down entirely. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  They are still fighting to keep it going. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  She is still fighting to stay out of jail. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=129.38s)]
*  But that is true both for her in the Philippines and for her fellow Nobel laureate in Russia, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=132.88s)]
*  both of them facing the same kind of threats. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=139.12s)]
*  Not because either of them has done anything other than commit journalism, but that's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=143.22s)]
*  how authoritarian governments treat journalists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=147.16s)]
*  That's how authoritarian governments treat the threat of the free press. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=149.96s)]
*  Literally even being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize cannot protect you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=154.68s)]
*  Yesterday, Argentina elected a new president, and it's the chainsaw guy, the guy whose [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=159.68s)]
*  followers wear make Argentina great again, baseball hats. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=166.68s)]
*  He got a big congratulations from Republican Party leader Donald Trump when he won this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=171.68s)]
*  election in Argentina yesterday. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=176.68s)]
*  He says that as Argentina's new president, he's going to eliminate that country's currency [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=178.68s)]
*  and abolish its central bank. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=184.68s)]
*  He says of the 18 departments in the federal government, he's going to eliminate 10 of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=186.68s)]
*  the 18, including health and education. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=190.68s)]
*  He has said he wants a free, totally unregulated market in guns in Argentina and also a free [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=193.68s)]
*  and totally unregulated market in human organs. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=200.68s)]
*  That said, he also wants a total ban on abortion. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=204.68s)]
*  So, you know, freedom. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=209.68s)]
*  But with a to do list like that, what are his priorities? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=211.68s)]
*  What comes first? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=216.68s)]
*  Well, what did he talk about first after getting elected? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=217.68s)]
*  He was elected last night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=220.68s)]
*  This was his victory speech last night. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=222.68s)]
*  You can see his signature, calm, cool, collected vibe on full display. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=224.68s)]
*  This is last night, the night he won. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=229.68s)]
*  And then today, first thing, he told reporters that he's going to move to dismantle the media [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=231.68s)]
*  outlets in Argentina that gave him critical coverage during the presidential campaign. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=236.68s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=240.68s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=242.68s)]
*  This is what they do everywhere. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=243.68s)]
*  As soon as Jair Bolsonaro got elected in Brazil, this was the headline even before Bolsonaro [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=246.68s)]
*  took office. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=251.68s)]
*  Brazil's next president declares war on fake news media. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=252.68s)]
*  That was 2018 when he was first elected. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=257.68s)]
*  By 2020, he was publicly making a show of threatening to punch a reporter in the face. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=260.68s)]
*  By 2023, when he was voted out of his office and his supporters tried their own January [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=265.68s)]
*  6th style storming of the Capitol, his supporters were just physically attacking the press. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=270.68s)]
*  That was Brazil. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=278.68s)]
*  That was Brazil. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=279.68s)]
*  In Poland, it was the Law and Justice Party there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=280.68s)]
*  And the headlines look remarkably familiar. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=283.68s)]
*  Poland targets TV channel, limits press freedom. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=285.68s)]
*  Poland's ruling party rams through media law. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=288.68s)]
*  New Freedom House report, how Poland's government set out to conquer a free press. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=291.68s)]
*  In Hungary, it's the authoritarian Viktor Orban, who of course is a fan favorite of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=297.68s)]
*  American conservatives and Republican media figures. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=302.68s)]
*  Under Viktor Orban, headlines in Hungary look like this. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=305.68s)]
*  Inside, Orban's crackdown on Hungary's free press. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=309.68s)]
*  Hungary dismantles media freedom and pluralism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=312.68s)]
*  Reporters Without Borders lists Viktor Orban as press freedom predator. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=316.68s)]
*  This is how they do it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=321.68s)]
*  They do it everywhere. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=323.68s)]
*  It speaks different languages. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=325.68s)]
*  It has different accents. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=326.68s)]
*  But it's all the same. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=327.68s)]
*  In his 2016 campaign and in his one term in office here, former Republican President [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=331.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, of course, made a whole sport out of it, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=337.68s)]
*  Denouncing the American free press as the enemy of the people and all that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=340.68s)]
*  Now that he's running for president again, though, he's getting more specific, saying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=344.68s)]
*  he's going to have MSNBC investigated for treason. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=348.68s)]
*  Okay, treason. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=353.68s)]
*  This weekend, Trump adviser Stephen Miller suggested that criminal charges should be [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=355.68s)]
*  brought against the media watchdog group Media Matters. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=360.68s)]
*  After Media Matters pointed out that on Twitter, the social media platform now owned by pro-Trump [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=364.68s)]
*  right-wing billionaire Elon Musk, major mainstream companies were having their ads appear [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=369.68s)]
*  right alongside overt pro-Nazi, pro-Hitler anti-Semitic material of the kind that floods [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=374.68s)]
*  that social media platform now that Mr. Musk has taken it over and now that he himself [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=380.68s)]
*  has started promoting some of the worst anti-Semitic content and sentiments on the site. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=384.68s)]
*  Stephen Miller says people should face criminal charges for pointing that out about what's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=390.68s)]
*  happening on Twitter. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=395.68s)]
*  And you know, it's one thing for a presidential candidate's adviser to point at something [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=396.68s)]
*  like that and say, hey, your critics in the media should be in jail for criticizing you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=401.68s)]
*  But it's quite another when the Republican attorney general of the state of Missouri [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=408.68s)]
*  then jumps in and volunteers that his office in Missouri is now looking into the matter, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=412.68s)]
*  presumably to see if he can use the powers of his office as state attorney general to help [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=417.68s)]
*  with the jailing your enemies part of it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=422.68s)]
*  Now, tonight, the Republican attorney general of Texas says he, in fact, has opened an [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=425.68s)]
*  official investigation of Media Matters, the media watchdog group that is pointing out what [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=429.68s)]
*  advertisers on Twitter are having their ads show up alongside on that now totally [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=435.68s)]
*  unmoderated, mostly unmoderated medium. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=440.68s)]
*  And why does the attorney general of Texas need to investigate Media Matters for having [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=445.68s)]
*  criticized a right-wing billionaire? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=451.68s)]
*  Because, you know, make Argentina great again or something. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=456.68s)]
*  You know, put the pacifist in jail for seven years in a Russian penal colony for the price [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=461.68s)]
*  tags protest. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=466.68s)]
*  Arrest the editors. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=468.68s)]
*  Drive their publications out of the country. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=470.68s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=474.68s)]
*  You [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcMsXexu9Hs&t=490.68s)]
