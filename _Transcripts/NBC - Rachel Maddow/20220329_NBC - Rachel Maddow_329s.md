# Failures Of Putin's Invasion Make Peace Talk Concessions Frustrating For Ukrainians
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg)
*  Back in the United States today, Connecticut Democratic Senator Chris Murphy reacted to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=0.0s)]
*  peace talks and to Russia's announcement of a military pullback from Kiev this way. He said, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  quote, not coincidental that this announcement comes a day after the Ukrainians new offensive [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=10.08s)]
*  likely achieved its biggest victory, the recapture of the key Kiev suburb of Irpin. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=16.0s)]
*  The Russians were potentially on the verge of a series of routes, end quote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=22.16s)]
*  Joining me now is Senator Murphy, is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=27.04s)]
*  thanks for making time to be with us tonight. I want to ask you about the proposal that some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=30.4s)]
*  of the Ukrainians have made, and that is that if they can't join NATO, can there be a mechanism [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=35.12s)]
*  set up by which their territorial integrity is protected and that others will come, someone else [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=41.44s)]
*  will come to their defense if Russia tries this nonsense again? What do you think about the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=47.36s)]
*  likelihood of a suggestion like that working? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=52.56s)]
*  Well, that is the essence of NATO, right? NATO is a mutual defense treaty in which we pledge to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  those that are part of that alliance that if they are attacked, that all of the members will come to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=65.2s)]
*  their defense. So it sounds as if Ukraine is asking to have the rights that NATO members enjoy [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=70.8s)]
*  while not being a member of NATO. You know, that's obviously something that the United States and our [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=78.8s)]
*  allies can discuss, but that's a fairly serious commitment to make, to have the United States [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=85.76s)]
*  guarantee the protection of Ukraine outside of the confines of NATO. Obviously, everybody wants to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=93.04s)]
*  talk about ways to bring this war to a close, and I think many of us will be willing to look at any [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=100.64s)]
*  asks that Zelensky makes of us. You know, a number of people I'm speaking to on the ground here are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=107.76s)]
*  regular Ukrainian citizens. Some of them are refugees who from other parts internally displaced [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=115.92s)]
*  people who have left their homes in eastern Ukraine or even Kiev and have come here to Lviv, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=121.12s)]
*  and they're all saying, why should Ukraine make any concessions whatsoever? They don't even think [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  this should be called a war because they didn't feel that they were party to it. They didn't want [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=130.56s)]
*  it, and they're concerned that in negotiations, just like with Crimea and the Donbas, they're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=135.12s)]
*  going to end up giving something up for no reason. Well, I think the United States should be careful [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=142.0s)]
*  to dictate the terms of a peace agreement to President Zelensky. President Zelensky has been [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=150.56s)]
*  incredible in his leadership throughout the first four weeks of this war, and he will make a decision [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=157.68s)]
*  on behalf of his country, along with the Rada, as to whether the terms on the table are acceptable [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=163.84s)]
*  or unacceptable. It is certainly a hard pill to swallow, the idea that as Russia is retreating [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=169.84s)]
*  from Kiev, that Ukraine would grant them territorial control over one inch of Ukrainian land. But there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=176.08s)]
*  are clearly things that can be on the table. The neutrality of Ukraine can be on the table. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=185.36s)]
*  Devolved power for eastern regions can be on the table, and I think the United States is willing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=191.68s)]
*  to put some things on the table as well. We've never had the intent of putting missiles inside [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=197.6s)]
*  of Ukraine that would threaten Russia, and we can make some commitments to give Russia confidence [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=203.12s)]
*  that that is not in the cards after this war ends. So it's up to Zelensky and his team as to what the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=209.76s)]
*  terms will be. We shouldn't dictate those to him. But our commitment is, if you are not ready to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=217.28s)]
*  sign an agreement, if the terms are too difficult or too onerous and you continue to fight, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=224.0s)]
*  the United States is going to stick with you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=229.36s)]
*  You've met with him four or five times. What's your sense of how he's been performing? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=234.0s)]
*  He's blown me away. I probably sat with Zelensky for more time than anyone else [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  in the Senate. I would lie to you if I would tell you I wasn't a bit surprised at how he has been [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  able to rally not just all of Ukraine, but the entire world. Listen, Zelensky knows how to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  use the media, and there's nothing more important in the early days of a war [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  than using mass media in order to win the propaganda battle. And it's pretty stunning [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=267.12s)]
*  that Russia, a country that prided itself on being able to win the information wars, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=272.88s)]
*  is in a position that they are getting their hat handed to them every single day, both militarily [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=277.92s)]
*  on the ground inside Ukraine, but also when it comes to the messaging. Putin is in a corner, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=284.0s)]
*  not just because he's been on the receiving end of an incredibly impressive military performance [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=290.4s)]
*  from the Ukrainians, but also because he simply doesn't have any friends who are willing to come [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=297.44s)]
*  to his aid. I don't think he counted on losing both the military battle and the propaganda battle. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=303.76s)]
*  you [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub3fSWgY6qg&t=327.44s)]
