# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI)
*  Just about exactly two years ago in October 2020, we learned about a story that was broken by a reporter at WWJ named Sandra McNeil. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=0.0s)]
*  Sandra McNeil had gotten a tip from a listener to WWJ in Detroit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=9.8s)]
*  The listener told her that they'd received a really, really sketchy robocall about the November 2020 presidential election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Now, as we all know, basically every robocall is sketchy, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=25.7s)]
*  Robocalls, by definition, are shady and annoying and almost always scammy, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=28.9s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=35.0s)]
*  But this one that this Detroit resident got right before the 2020 election, this one was so bad. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=36.5s)]
*  It not only seemed worse than your typical robocall, it seemed so bad. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=43.8s)]
*  It kind of seemed like it might be a crime. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=48.4s)]
*  And the spoiler alert for the end of the story, it turns out it was a crime. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=51.0s)]
*  Turns out the listener to WWJ was right to sound the alarm about it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=57.4s)]
*  And reporter Sandra McNeil and WWJ were right to go big with the story. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=62.0s)]
*  So I'm going to play you the sound of the robocall now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=67.7s)]
*  I'm going to tell you in advance that everything in this robocall is wrong. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=71.1s)]
*  None of this is true. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=74.7s)]
*  Do not believe a second of it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=75.9s)]
*  But you should hear what it was, because this literally was a crime committed against the American people, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=77.7s)]
*  specifically against black registered voters in the lead up to the 2020 election. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=84.1s)]
*  Now again, everything in that is wrong. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=114.1s)]
*  None of that is true. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=133.0s)]
*  Voting by mail is fine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=135.0s)]
*  It does not expose you to the police tracking you down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=137.2s)]
*  It does not expose you to credit card companies getting to you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=140.1s)]
*  It doesn't expose you to, you know, somebody giving you a vaccine you don't want, let alone the CDC doing that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=142.9s)]
*  Voting by mail does none of those things. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=148.4s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Everything in that robocall was a lie. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=151.3s)]
*  But in 2020, in the lead up to the 2020 election, radio station WWJ in Detroit reported that Detroit residents were receiving that call. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=155.5s)]
*  A lot of Detroit residents were receiving that call. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=163.0s)]
*  Thousands of them were getting that call. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=165.8s)]
*  Now Detroit, of course, is a Democratic stronghold in the swing state of Michigan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=169.0s)]
*  It's a city that is roughly 80 percent African-American. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=174.5s)]
*  And here's this call going out to thousands of registered voters saying it's from a civil rights organization, which it was not, and telling people they need to be terrified to vote. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=179.4s)]
*  It's just disgusting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=188.9s)]
*  And it was more than just shady. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=191.4s)]
*  Voter intimidation is a crime. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  That robocall was a crime. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=195.8s)]
*  And here on this show, almost exactly two years ago, after this was first exposed by the local press in Detroit, we had here on the show, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, when she announced that state felony charges were being filed against the two men who initially denied that they put out that call, but then finally admitted that they had done it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=198.5s)]
*  The investigation into that robocall in 2020 ultimately turned up the fact that this trash wasn't just targeted against black voters in Detroit, in Michigan. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=217.7s)]
*  It was also used against thousands of black registered voters in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh, in Illinois, in Chicago, also in New York, also in Ohio. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=227.7s)]
*  Tens of thousands of these calls were placed all to majority black majority Democratic voting areas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Now there were those felony cases, felony charges brought against the guys who brought that call in Michigan, first announced here on the show. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  Also, a federal civil rights lawsuit, excuse me, a federal civil lawsuit was brought against those guys who placed those calls. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=258.8s)]
*  That federal civil lawsuit is still not resolved, but the federal judge hearing that civil case actually ordered the guys who sent out that call that they needed to pay for a follow-up, corrective call to all the people who got the initial call. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  The follow-up explaining that their previous call had contained false information and in fact had been determined in federal court to be an intimidation effort designed to interfere with the election. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  So the federal judge in that case ordered those guys to place follow-up calls disavowing everything that had happened in the first call. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=291.0s)]
*  That federal civil case is still pending. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=298.0s)]
*  In addition to the criminal charges in Michigan and that federal civil case and being ordered to send the follow-up corrective call, the FCC took a look at this as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=300.0s)]
*  FCC regulates things like robocalls. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=310.1s)]
*  The FCC made actually a very rare unanimous recommendation that the guys who sent that call should pay the largest fine ever levied against anyone for any robocall of any kind. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=312.1s)]
*  The FCC unanimously recommended they should pay more than $5 million as a fine for having sent those calls to black voters in advance of the 2020 election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=326.1s)]
*  In terms of where this stands now, the felony charges brought against those two guys in the state of Michigan, those felony charges are still pending. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  But state prosecutors also brought charges against these guys, felony charges against them in the great state of Ohio. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  And today, almost two years to the day since we first reported on that fantastically racist voter intimidation campaign, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  today, those two conservative activists who sent out those calls to tens of thousands of voters in Ohio and Michigan and New York and Illinois and all these other places, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=363.3s)]
*  those two conservative activists today in court in Ohio pled guilty to felony telecommunications fraud. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=374.3s)]
*  They had been facing 15 felony counts each in Ohio. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=382.3s)]
*  The court allowed them to each plead guilty to one felony in exchange for having the other charges dropped. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  They're going to be sentenced next month. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  They're each looking at up to a year in prison plus whatever they get if they're convicted of the felonies they're facing in Michigan, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  plus the $5 million plus fine they're facing from the FCC, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  plus whatever may get decided against them in that federal civil case, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  which is at SDNY that's being handled by the New York attorney general, Tish James. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=412.5s)]
*  So that was two years ago. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=418.5s)]
*  That was how conservative activists were handling the run up to the vote in 2020. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=419.5s)]
*  And these are the consequences they, as of today, are just now starting to face for the fact that what they decided would be their game plan back in 2020 happened to be as fantastically illegal as it was disgusting. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=423.5s)]
*  The folks who are trying to contest the election this year by doing things that are illegal, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=435.6s)]
*  like we saw in 2020 from the conservative side, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=442.6s)]
*  the people who are doing that version of those tactics again this year, right? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=444.6s)]
*  Intimidating people out of voting, threatening people for voting. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=449.6s)]
*  It may have taken two years before we got some accountability for one of the worst instances of that in the last election. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=452.6s)]
*  It may have taken till today before we saw the first felony guilty plea pursuant to those tactics used on the conservative side in the 2020 election. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  But it may not have to take another two years this time. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=467.70000000000005s)]
*  In Arizona, where we are seeing Republican candidates and Republican elected officials tell their supporters to go out and intimidate people at voting sites, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=471.70000000000005s)]
*  where we are seeing people respond to those calls by showing up with guns at voting sites. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=481.70000000000005s)]
*  Tonight in Arizona, we just got the first legal challenge to what these vigilantes are doing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=487.8s)]
*  Here it is, the complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief just filed tonight in federal court in Arizona. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=493.8s)]
*  Quote, at least five times last week, supporters of defendant Clean Elections USA gathered at ballot drop boxes in Maricopa County, Arizona, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=500.8s)]
*  with the express purpose of deterring voters from depositing their ballots. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=509.8s)]
*  And things are getting worse. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=512.8s)]
*  On Friday, two of the drop box watchers were armed and wearing tactical gear. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=514.9s)]
*  And again on Saturday, armed and masked individuals were gathered near drop boxes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=518.9s)]
*  Defendants' activities have already prompted three voter intimidation complaints that have been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=522.9s)]
*  as well as responses and investigations by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=528.9s)]
*  Defendants boast that they are just getting started. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=532.9s)]
*  Defendants' coordinated campaign of vigilante voter intimidation violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=536.9s)]
*  and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=544.0s)]
*  In the aftermath of previous voter suppression efforts in the Reconstruction and Civil Rights eras, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=546.0s)]
*  Congress responded forcefully by enacting laws that unequivocally prohibit voter intimidation. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=550.0s)]
*  Immediate relief is necessary. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=556.0s)]
*  Voting is already underway. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=558.0s)]
*  There are only 15 days left until Election Day. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=560.0s)]
*  Again, this was filed in federal court tonight. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=562.0s)]
*  Defendants' organized vigilante groups have already turned away voters. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=564.0s)]
*  Under any circumstance, defendants' conduct would be objectively intimidating. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=570.1s)]
*  But in the current charged political climate, defendants' actions carry with them exacerbated threats. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=574.1s)]
*  There is no guarantee that the crowds that defendants have mobilized and are continuing to stoke will remain peaceful. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=579.1s)]
*  Unless enjoined, defendants will continue to bully and intimidate lawful Arizona voters, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=586.1s)]
*  including through using armed presences, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=592.1s)]
*  voters who are attempting to do nothing more than vote in accordance with Arizona law. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=595.1s)]
*  And then here's the plea for relief. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=599.2s)]
*  Wherefore, plaintiffs respectively request that this court enter judgment in their favor and against defendants [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=601.2s)]
*  and declare that defendants have violated the Voting Rights Act [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=607.2s)]
*  and declare that defendants have violated the Ku Klux Klan Act [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=610.2s)]
*  and temporarily and permanently enjoin the defendants and their respective agents, officers, employees, and successors [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=613.2s)]
*  and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=618.2s)]
*  from gathering within site of drop boxes, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=621.2s)]
*  from following, taking photos of, or otherwise recording voters or prospective voters, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=623.2s)]
*  for training, organizing, or directing others to do the same. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=627.3000000000001s)]
*  Managing an election is not supposed to be a scary thing in our country. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=633.3000000000001s)]
*  Neither is voting. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=637.3000000000001s)]
*  But we are seeing the news out of Arizona these days. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=638.3000000000001s)]
*  One voter in Mesa, Arizona last week reported being filmed [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=642.3000000000001s)]
*  while approaching a drop box to drop off his ballot, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  which is a lawful thing to do. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  As of Friday in Arizona, they're apparently now showing up armed and in tactical gear at voting sites. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  You can see them more closely here in this footage, which I believe we have. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=656.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=661.4s)]
*  This is at a voting site? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=662.4s)]
*  If you are alarmed by these kinds of images, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=666.4s)]
*  if you think this doesn't sound right, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=668.4s)]
*  if you think this maybe doesn't even sound lawful, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=669.4s)]
*  you are not alone. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=671.4s)]
*  As I mentioned at the top of the show, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=672.4s)]
*  a new lawsuit was just filed tonight in federal court in Arizona [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=674.4s)]
*  asking the court to step in and stop this from happening right away, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=677.4s)]
*  at least in that state. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=682.4s)]
*  Quote, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=683.5s)]
*  Again, this lawsuit just filed tonight, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=701.5s)]
*  federal court in Arizona. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=702.5s)]
*  Joining us now is Mark Elias, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=703.5s)]
*  election lawyer, founder of Democracy Docket, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=704.5s)]
*  which filed that voter intimidation lawsuit tonight in Arizona [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=707.5s)]
*  on behalf of two local organizations. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=711.6s)]
*  Mr. Elias, it's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=713.6s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=715.6s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=716.6s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about the basis for this lawsuit [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=717.6s)]
*  and who your organization is representing in bringing it? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=723.6s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=727.6s)]
*  So our organization is representing two really great pro-voting groups, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=728.6s)]
*  the Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=734.6s)]
*  And the basic facts of the complaint are simple, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=739.7s)]
*  which is that we now have vigilantes, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=742.7s)]
*  some of whom are armed, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=745.7s)]
*  intimidating voters from casting their ballots in a legal way, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=747.7s)]
*  that is via drop-off. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=751.7s)]
*  The law is very clear. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=753.7s)]
*  There are actually two sets of laws, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=755.7s)]
*  one that go back to the days of the Klu Klux Klan in the 19th century, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=756.7s)]
*  the Klu Klux Klan Act, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=762.7s)]
*  the other more recent, the Voting Rights Act, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=763.7s)]
*  that specifically prevent this type of intimidation at the poll. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  How late is too late for this kind of an intervention? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=771.8000000000001s)]
*  We're 15 days out from the election, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  and obviously you're asking for immediate relief from the courts. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you believe the courts can act quickly enough, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  the courts can be sort of nimble enough, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  to intervene in a way that will protect voting rights [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  in enough time to make a difference? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  I do. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Rachel, we heard that the court has scheduled a hearing on this motion [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=791.9s)]
*  tomorrow morning in Arizona, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=796.9s)]
*  so we're glad to see the federal courts are stepping in and stepping in quickly. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=798.9s)]
*  You know, after Donald Trump lost his election fair and square, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=802.9s)]
*  the courts played an important role in making clear [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=806.9s)]
*  what the outcome of that election was. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=810.9s)]
*  Donald Trump then unleashed vigilantes to storm the Capitol, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=812.9s)]
*  and now we are seeing the return of that vigilanteism [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=816.9s)]
*  organized by the same factions of the Republican Party that were at play then. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=820.0s)]
*  And we need the courts once again to step up and take this seriously [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=825.0s)]
*  and prevent voters from being disenfranchised. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=831.0s)]
*  Now, the defendants in this case that you've brought [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=834.0s)]
*  include one of these sort of anti-voting rights pressure groups [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=836.0s)]
*  that have sprung up all over the country in recent years [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=841.0s)]
*  and have been particularly energized since the 2020 election. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=844.0s)]
*  Also, the founder of one of those groups is a named defendant in your case. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=847.1s)]
*  But I wanted to ask you about the role of the various Republican elected officials [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=850.1s)]
*  who have bolstered what these groups are doing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=857.1s)]
*  We've got the Republican candidate for Secretary of State, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=860.1s)]
*  the Republican candidate for governor. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=862.1s)]
*  We've got at least two that I know of sitting Republican state senators [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=864.1s)]
*  who are pushing this effort, who are encouraging people to turn out [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=869.1s)]
*  and be vigilantes at voting sites. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=872.1s)]
*  I wonder if you see some of these officials as bearing some of the same responsibility here. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=875.2s)]
*  Absolutely. Republicans from top to bottom bear responsibility. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=880.2s)]
*  Where is Mitch McConnell calling this out? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=884.2s)]
*  Where is Kevin McCarthy calling this out? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=886.2s)]
*  Where are the so-called responsible leaders of the Republican Party saying [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=889.2s)]
*  having armed vigilantes at the polls preventing people from casting their ballots [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=893.2s)]
*  in a legal way is wrong and they're going to denounce it? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=898.2s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=902.2s)]
*  It's not just the Kerry Lakes. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=903.3000000000001s)]
*  It's not just the state legislators in Arizona. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=904.3000000000001s)]
*  It is from top to bottom a party that has abandoned democracy [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=908.3000000000001s)]
*  and has lost all semblance of decency. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  You note in your lawsuit that several of these encounters have been referred [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=915.3000000000001s)]
*  to the U.S. Justice Department as potentially illegal voter intimidation [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=918.3000000000001s)]
*  asking effectively for prosecutions at the federal level [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=923.3000000000001s)]
*  in addition to a civil suit like yours. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=928.3000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to ask you if you see the Justice Department as having a more immediate role here, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=930.4s)]
*  whether or not they consider prosecutions for these things at the federal level, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=935.4s)]
*  should the Justice Department be sending monitors, be sending in personnel now [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=938.4s)]
*  to try to prevent the sorts of infringements on voter rights, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=943.4s)]
*  the voter intimidation that your lawsuit is calling out [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=948.4s)]
*  as such an immediate threat in this last 15 days? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=952.4s)]
*  Look, we need everyone at all times. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=955.4s)]
*  Look, we need everyone at all levels of law enforcement to take this seriously. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=958.5s)]
*  I was glad to see that the Sheriff's Department, the local police [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=964.5s)]
*  in Maricopa County are stepping up, but this isn't their job alone. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=968.5s)]
*  And the Justice Department is headed by some really great civil rights lawyers [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=975.5s)]
*  and I'm sure they're looking at their options. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=979.5s)]
*  But we're all going to have to do our part and bringing this civil lawsuit, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=981.5s)]
*  getting immediate relief for the voters in Maricopa County [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=986.6s)]
*  and the entire state of Arizona is my immediate goal. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=989.6s)]
*  Mark Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=994.6s)]
*  Keep us apprised. I'm interested to hear that the first hearing on this case [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=998.6s)]
*  is going to be tomorrow morning. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1001.6s)]
*  It is intriguing that the courts are willing to move so quickly. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1003.6s)]
*  We'd love to stay apprised and up on the case. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1006.6s)]
*  Thank you, Mark. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1008.6s)]
*  Thank you, Ray. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1009.6s)]
*  Today is the day that early in-person voting starts in Florida. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1011.6s)]
*  Also early voting today starts in Texas. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1015.7s)]
*  And there's something interesting that's going on with early voting this year. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1018.7s)]
*  Let's look first at Georgia. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1021.7s)]
*  By this point in the last midterm election, so 2018 was the last midterm, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1023.7s)]
*  the number of people who had voted early in Georgia was huge. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1029.7s)]
*  It was a record-beating number, 2018, it was 434,000 people. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1033.7s)]
*  That was seen at the time as just being unfathomably large for early voting numbers. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1038.7s)]
*  Again, that was 2018. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1043.8s)]
*  If you compare that to the previous midterm four years earlier in 2014, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1044.8s)]
*  the 2018 numbers tripled what they had done in 2014. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1048.8s)]
*  430,000 votes by this point in 2018, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1053.8s)]
*  three times the early votes that had been cast by that point in the previous midterm, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1056.8s)]
*  so it was just huge. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1060.8s)]
*  So again, 2018, just over 430,000 people had voted. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1061.8s)]
*  That was unimaginably large in terms of Georgia's records. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1066.8s)]
*  Well, now it's the next midterm after 2018. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1070.8999999999999s)]
*  What does early voting in Georgia look like today? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1073.8999999999999s)]
*  According to the Georgia Secretary of State's office, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1076.8999999999999s)]
*  the number of people who voted early this year is already well over 750,000. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1078.8999999999999s)]
*  That's almost as high as the number of people who had voted by this time [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1084.8999999999999s)]
*  in the general election in Georgia in 2020, in the presidential year, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1088.8999999999999s)]
*  when it was Joe Biden versus Donald Trump on the ballot. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1091.8999999999999s)]
*  The midterm elections are the same numbers, effectively, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1094.8999999999999s)]
*  as the presidential election, the presidential general election. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1099.0s)]
*  That kind of early voter turnout in a midterm election year [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1103.0s)]
*  is not just unheard of, it's almost like science fiction. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1106.0s)]
*  I mean, 400,000 was mind-blowing four years ago. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1109.0s)]
*  Now it's over 750,000? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1112.0s)]
*  It's just a whole new world, a huge surge in early voting in Georgia this year, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1115.0s)]
*  and it is not just happening in Georgia. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1120.0s)]
*  In North Carolina, requests for absentee ballots there are up 114 percent, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1122.0s)]
*  compared with the last midterm. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1128.1s)]
*  In Ohio, the number of people voting early is up 75 percent from the last midterm. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1130.1s)]
*  In Florida, the total number of people who have already voted early by mail, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1135.1s)]
*  it's up 50 percent already from the last midterm. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1139.1s)]
*  For all the efforts on the right this year to make voting scary and harder [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1143.1s)]
*  and disproportionately threatening to likely Democratic voters, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1148.1s)]
*  especially people of color, for all those efforts that we are seeing [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1151.1s)]
*  and that we have been reporting on, even tonight, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1154.1s)]
*  lots of Americans are showing up to vote early, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1157.1999999999998s)]
*  in record numbers in multiple states this year. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1160.1999999999998s)]
*  And obviously these numbers, they just tell you numbers, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1163.1999999999998s)]
*  they don't tell you anything about who's necessarily going to win the election, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1166.1999999999998s)]
*  but it does tell you that people are willing to show up and vote, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1169.1999999999998s)]
*  and that is good news for a country that is effectively voting this year [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1172.1999999999998s)]
*  on the question of whether or not we're going to continue to have elections, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  whether or not we are going to continue to be a democracy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1179.1999999999998s)]
*  Seeing this many Americans turning up, despite all the headwinds, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1183.3s)]
*  to cast their votes this year of all years, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1187.3s)]
*  I don't know if you have cockles in your heart, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1190.3s)]
*  but if you have cockles in your heart, they are probably warmed by this. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1192.3s)]
*  Again, early voting begins today in Texas, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1195.3s)]
*  early in-person voting begins today in Florida. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1198.3s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1201.3s)]
*  The American people are voting. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eip9VNeI1oI&t=1213.3s)]
