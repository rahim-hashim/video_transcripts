# Fake Trump Elector Scheme Draws The Attention Of More State Attorneys General
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY)
*  In Michigan today, the attorney general, Dana Nessel, answered questions from local reporters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=0.0s)]
*  about her reasoning in asking the U.S. attorney's office in Michigan to bring a federal criminal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=5.14s)]
*  investigation of 16 Republicans who signed and submitted a forged document claiming to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=10.72s)]
*  be the state's electors after the last election, when in fact they were not. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=16.48s)]
*  She reiterated the argument that she made the day that she made the referral to federal [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=21.0s)]
*  prosecutors, saying that she believes this makes the most sense as a federal investigation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  But interestingly, speaking with local reporters today, she also clarified that if the federal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=29.6s)]
*  U.S. Justice Department chooses not to pursue a prosecution in this case, her office does [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  absolutely believe there's plenty enough evidence to prosecute these 16 Republicans under Michigan [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=40.0s)]
*  state law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=45.56s)]
*  At this point, do you think that there is enough evidence, if you wanted to, to bring [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=46.56s)]
*  charges against these electors under state law? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=55.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=60.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=61.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=62.04s)]
*  And then second question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=63.04s)]
*  Have you interviewed or are any of these individuals cooperating with your investigation of what [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=65.4s)]
*  you've done so far? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=70.48s)]
*  Yeah, I can't comment on the investigation at this point. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=71.76s)]
*  I will say that, again, I feel confident that we have enough evidence to charge. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=76.68s)]
*  Should we decide to pursue that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=80.28s)]
*  Again, I want to make it clear. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=82.12s)]
*  I haven't ruled it out, but for all the reasons I stated, I think that it's a better idea [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=83.48s)]
*  for the feds to pursue this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=88.6s)]
*  But technically, it is an ongoing investigation, even though we have given everything that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  we have to the feds so that they will have that information should they wish to pursue [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=97.52s)]
*  it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  It is not as though we have made a determination that we are certainly not going to charge. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  So I am just sort of waiting to see what it is that they'll decide to do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=108.5s)]
*  So, again, I'm not denying that these 16 individuals could be prosecuted under state law. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=115.44s)]
*  I'm not denying that at all. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=118.72s)]
*  I'm saying that if one of your goals is to find out who orchestrated this, again, seemingly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=120.56s)]
*  there is a conspiracy that occurred between multiple states. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=126.96s)]
*  So if what your ultimate goal is, is not just to prosecute these 16 individuals, but to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=130.64s)]
*  find out, you know, who put them up to this? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=137.44s)]
*  Is this part of a bigger conspiracy at play in order to undermine the legitimate results [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=140.6s)]
*  of the 2020 presidential election, not just in Michigan, but nationally? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=147.24s)]
*  It's going to involve interviews in other states and it's going to involve possible [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=153.0s)]
*  prosecutions in other places. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=157.72s)]
*  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel speaking with reporters in Michigan today, making the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=162.44s)]
*  case that the part of the Republican plot to try to overthrow the government and keep [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=167.04s)]
*  Donald Trump in power after he lost the last election, the part of that that involves some [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=172.6s)]
*  sort of coordinated effort to have Republicans in multiple states forge documents saying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=177.04s)]
*  that they were their state's electors when they were not. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=182.88s)]
*  Attorney General Nessel says her office believes that that can be charged as a crime under [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=186.88s)]
*  Michigan law and they have absolutely enough evidence to do so. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=190.84s)]
*  But she said they believe the larger scheme should be pursued by the federal government [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=194.82s)]
*  because it wasn't just in Michigan, it was in multiple states. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=198.18s)]
*  Again, that was the attorney general of the great state of Michigan, Dana Nessel, speaking [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=201.22s)]
*  with reporters today. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=205.22s)]
*  And I have to tell you tonight, just before we got on the air, we got news that yet another [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=206.68s)]
*  state is investigating this matter as a potential crime. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=210.56s)]
*  We have this federal referral from the attorney general in Michigan that she was just describing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=215.06s)]
*  there with local reporters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=218.66s)]
*  As we reported here last night, the attorney general in the state of New Mexico, attorney [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=220.6s)]
*  general Hector Balderas, he says that he too is referring this matter to the U.S. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  attorney in New Mexico for potential prosecution as a federal crime. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  And now there's this from the attorney general in the state of Nevada, Aaron Ford, quote, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  Our office has received numerous inquiries regarding some members of the state Republican [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  Party attempting to award fake electoral votes to former President Donald Trump after the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=241.38s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=246.06s)]
*  While we cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, rest assured that this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  matter is on our radar and we take seriously any efforts to rob Nevadans of their votes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=252.66s)]
*  There's been a sustained effort to invalidate the 2020 election and to downplay the shocking [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=258.74s)]
*  actions that took place afterward. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=262.34s)]
*  My office cannot and will not accept any efforts to overturn a free and fair election. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=264.74s)]
*  Voting rights are fundamental to our Democratic Republic and we will continue to protect them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  Again, so to recap, in Michigan, the state attorney general has referred those Republicans [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  who signed the fake electoral documents, referred them to federal prosecutors for potential [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=280.5s)]
*  federal criminal prosecution. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=284.42s)]
*  The same thing has happened in the state of New Mexico, where the attorney general in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=286.5s)]
*  the state of New Mexico has made a similar referral to federal prosecutors. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=289.62s)]
*  Now in the state of Nevada, we've got the statement from the attorney general saying [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=293.86s)]
*  we cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, but rest assured that this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=297.54s)]
*  matter is on our radar. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=301.46s)]
*  I don't know what that means in legal terms, but there you have it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=303.3s)]
*  We do know the January 6th investigation in Congress is looking at least broadly at this [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=307.86s)]
*  part of the plot by which Republicans in at least five different states filled out these [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=314.26s)]
*  forged documents pretending to be electors and those documents were sent into Congress. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=320.18s)]
*  So we know that the January 6th investigation is looking at it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=327.06s)]
*  That in fact is some of the way that we were able to find out some of the reporting, some [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=329.74s)]
*  of the sort of reporting trails that everybody was able to follow in order to figure out [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  that these documents existed, that they were all similar, they were all part of a coordinated [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=338.5s)]
*  effort and that the January 6th investigation is looking at them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  So we know the January 6th investigators are on this at least in some way. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=345.85999999999996s)]
*  Now we know the U.S. Justice Department has formally been asked in at least two states [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=349.94s)]
*  to contend with it as well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Xn_tgLrZY&t=364.34s)]
