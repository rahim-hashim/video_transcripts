# Every Vote Matters, Just Ask Montgomery County, Pennsylvania
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI)
*  Take, for instance, the race for the state House seat representing the 142nd legislative [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=0.0s)]
*  district in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=6.08s)]
*  I know you've been laser focused on it at home. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=8.0s)]
*  That race is currently separated by 114 votes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=10.92s)]
*  But I'll tell you why that race has potentially national implications. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=15.46s)]
*  Right now, Republicans have 100 seats in the Pennsylvania state legislature, Pennsylvania [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  state House. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Republicans have 100 seats. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Democrats have 100 seats. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=27.2s)]
*  In the Pennsylvania state House, it is 100 to 100 in Pennsylvania right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=29.76s)]
*  Pennsylvania Democrats have said that they are going to reclaim the Pennsylvania House, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=35.72s)]
*  which I think would be the first time in more than a decade that they have been in control [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=39.88s)]
*  there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=42.88s)]
*  But there are three races left there to be called. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=43.88s)]
*  One of them will be settled by a special election because the Democrat who won that seat handily [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=46.08s)]
*  last week had actually died before Election Day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=49.96s)]
*  That seat will likely go Democratic again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=54.06s)]
*  There's that Bucks County race that's separated by 114 votes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=56.44s)]
*  Then there's a Montgomery County, Pennsylvania race, which is separated by 14 votes, literally [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=59.96s)]
*  14 votes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  So partisan control of the Pennsylvania state House and all that means it might change hands [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=67.6s)]
*  for the first time in 12 years, but it's going to come down to one race that's about 100 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=73.32s)]
*  votes and one race that's about a dozen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=78.32s)]
*  Just in case you needed motivation to know that your vote really counts. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5R01BqUjI&t=80.8s)]
