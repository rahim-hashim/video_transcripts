# Overseas Doctors Help U.S. Women With Medication Abortions To Circumvent New Bans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao)
*  So, this is new. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=0.0s)]
*  This is something I do not think we have seen before. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=2.24s)]
*  It's from The New York Times today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=5.44s)]
*  Quote, within a few days, Just the Pill, a nonprofit organization that arranges for women [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  to obtain abortion pills, Just the Pill plans to deploy in Colorado the first of what will [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=13.0s)]
*  become a fleet of mobile clinics to park along state borders, providing consultations for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=19.16s)]
*  medication abortions and dispensing pills. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=25.76s)]
*  Called Quote, Abortion Delivered, the Clinic on Wheels program will also provide surgical [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=29.48s)]
*  abortions for patients who prefer that or who are too far along in pregnancy for a medication [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=34.2s)]
*  abortion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=39.44s)]
*  The program is designed to reach patients from states like Texas, Oklahoma, and South [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=40.44s)]
*  Dakota that quickly outlawed abortion after the court decision, as well as other states [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=44.46s)]
*  like Utah that are expected to ban or sharply restrict abortion soon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  So that's one potential on the ground response to the Supreme Court decision overturning [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=54.52s)]
*  Roe vs. Wade, overturning the right to legal abortion. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=59.28s)]
*  Put abortion services on wheels and take them to the borders of states where abortion is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  outlawed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=68.2s)]
*  So, American women can't get a legal abortion in state X, but if they take a few steps over [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=69.2s)]
*  the border from state X into state Y, then they can. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=75.56s)]
*  Again, this was like sort of a, this was a thought experiment kind of idea. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  This was a dystopian sci-fi concept in terms of how American women would still be able [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  to retain the right to make decisions about the most intimate decisions in their lives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=89.44s)]
*  It's now apparently going into effect within days. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=96.16s)]
*  Another way for women in states with abortion bans to access abortion may be for them to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=100.12s)]
*  get abortion pills, which again you can use for many abortions within the first 10 weeks [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=106.02s)]
*  or so of pregnancy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=110.74s)]
*  You could get abortion pills prescribed by a provider overseas, a provider in another [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=112.42s)]
*  country who is therefore beyond the reach of U.S. state laws designed to block that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=117.78s)]
*  sort of thing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  That is an approach pioneered by a doctor named Rebecca Gompertz. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=123.74s)]
*  She's a Dutch doctor. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=127.66s)]
*  She has spent decades figuring out innovative ways to get abortion services to women in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  countries where abortion is illegal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  Her organization Women on Waves has, for example, provided abortions on ships floating in international waters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=137.06s)]
*  She then created Women on Web to mail abortion pills to patients all around the globe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=144.7s)]
*  In 2018, she saw into the future and decided that the United States was joining the ranks [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  of countries needing her group's services. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=156.5s)]
*  She then launched a group called Aid Access. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=159.38s)]
*  It's specifically to provide medication abortions to patients in the United States in states [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=161.5s)]
*  that had banned telemedicine abortions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=166.86s)]
*  Physicians overseas do the video consultations with women in the U.S. and then the pills [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=169.82s)]
*  are often mailed from overseas as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=174.74s)]
*  We have entered a new era in America now, one in which an overseas organization like [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=178.72s)]
*  Aid Access will not just be the only way to get a telemedicine abortion in many states. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=182.74s)]
*  It may be the only way, period, to get an abortion in about half the states in the union. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=187.48s)]
*  The work that Dr. Gompertz has been doing globally, figuring out how to get women abortion [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  services when their countries have made it illegal, that's that work that's going [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  to need to be done across borders inside the United States as well, figuring out how to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=203.72s)]
*  get abortion services to women in states where it is illegal. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=208.12s)]
*  The time has come. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=214.6s)]
*  What do Americans now need to learn? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=215.96s)]
*  What can Americans learn from somebody who has been doing this pioneering work for decades? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Rebecca Gompertz. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=224.16s)]
*  She is the founder of Women on Waves and Aid Access. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=225.72s)]
*  Dr. Gompertz, I really appreciate you joining us, especially given how late it is where [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=228.64s)]
*  you are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=232.64s)]
*  It's really kind of you to be here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=233.64s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel, for inviting me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=234.64s)]
*  I'm very happy to be here, Michelle. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=237.2s)]
*  Let me ask you first about the Roe vs. Wade decision by the United States Supreme Court. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=240.2s)]
*  I think it was not, it could not be described as a surprise in this country, even though [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=245.6s)]
*  I think it was still a shock. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=250.44s)]
*  I know enough about your work to know that you probably saw it coming better than maybe [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=252.88s)]
*  some of us here did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=258.28s)]
*  And you were also taking steps even ahead of that ruling to try to mitigate some of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=260.36s)]
*  the severe restrictions that states had already put on abortion access, even with the Roe [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=265.28s)]
*  law still in place. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=270.64s)]
*  Well, we started getting a lot of requests from women from the United States already [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=273.64s)]
*  for a few years with Women on Web. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  And the reasons that women were looking for access was because they could often not afford [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=282.4s)]
*  the abortion services locally, but also privacy reasons. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=287.76s)]
*  For example, people that were living in domestic violence or they couldn't travel because the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=292.96s)]
*  distances to travel were already quite long. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=299.68s)]
*  So there was already and there were already women that were not able to access abortions [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=302.52s)]
*  in the US before the ruling. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's just really unfortunate that Trump has been able to appoint three court judges [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=310.92s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=316.72s)]
*  And now that Roe vs. Wade has been overturned. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=318.12s)]
*  And of course, here in Europe, we really look with trembling to see how also many of the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=320.48s)]
*  other human rights that have been recognized for long in the United States might now be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=326.8s)]
*  over, might now be disappear, basically. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=330.48s)]
*  You have pioneered from an international perspective this tactic, essentially, of getting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=335.76s)]
*  women access to medication abortion, getting them the pills in ways that essentially work [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  around restrictions at the local or national level that are designed to prevent that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=349.44s)]
*  What should Americans now understand about whether or not medication abortion can offer [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=354.28s)]
*  American women a way to retain this right once states try to make it go away? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=360.96s)]
*  We have already seen some Republican controlled states say they will essentially try to block [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  women from getting abortion medications, from getting pills any way they can, trying to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=370.4s)]
*  block them from being sent through the mail, trying to block women from even leaving to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=375.11999999999995s)]
*  go to other states to get them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=378.84s)]
*  What do you see about the sort of height of that legal barrier when it comes to medication [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=381.08s)]
*  abortion specifically? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, we see in other countries where abortion is illegal is that there's no way that those [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=387.44s)]
*  bills can be stopped. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  There will be women's organizations, other people that will bring in the medicines and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  make sure that women will have it and be able to use it when they need it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  But I think what is going to be, it will make it much harder for many and especially the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=405.76s)]
*  more vulnerable women, for them it might be really not possible to get to get bills. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=412.76s)]
*  What we see is that it won't stop people from having abortions. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=419.52s)]
*  And these are actually also emails that we already received with aid access where people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=422.52s)]
*  were writing about how they were trying to induce their abortions by, for example, using [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=426.4s)]
*  herbs or jumping off stairs or using knitting needles. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=431.36s)]
*  So there is still, there will be women that will not be able to access the bills and will [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=435.44s)]
*  also try to harm themselves to end pregnancies. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=441.08s)]
*  And then, of course, the later the women that are later in pregnancies, the bills can still [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=445.92s)]
*  be used. It's still safe to use them also after 12 weeks. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=452.6s)]
*  The World Health Organization is supporting home use to 12 weeks. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=456.84s)]
*  But afterwards, the research now shows that it's also safe to do that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=460.92s)]
*  People have to be close to emergency care. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=464.8s)]
*  And one of the concerns that we have is that we've seen that sometimes doctors that work [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=467.8s)]
*  in emergency wards, they don't want to help people when they present with a miscarriage [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=472.72s)]
*  or an abortion because they are scared that that would make them that they would be could [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  be prosecuted under strict abortion laws. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=484.16s)]
*  So, for example, in Ireland, a woman died because this happened and important as well. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=487.28s)]
*  And I think one of the things is very important to teach the doctors that they can help women [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  when they have when they're when their lives are in danger and that they need medical care. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=498.0s)]
*  That's terrifying, not only because we've seen it happened, as you just described, but [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  the prospect that health care providers will see a woman in extremis who has naturally [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=510.88s)]
*  miscarried or who has taken medication abortion. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=516.6s)]
*  Some for some reason, she has a complication that could hurt her and could kill her and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=518.64s)]
*  they'll stand by because they're afraid themselves of being prosecuted. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=522.52s)]
*  Are there any sort of lessons learned that you can convey to us as a country where abortion [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=526.16s)]
*  is newly illegal in terms of just the most effective organizing, the most potent work [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  that people who support abortion rights can do to try to save women's lives? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=538.24s)]
*  I think at this moment, what people in the US can do is that they make sure that they [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=542.08s)]
*  have the abortion bills at home for when they need it or when a friend needs it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  So everybody should just get the abortion bills as much as they can so that it's everywhere. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlkkmKbJao&t=553.36s)]
