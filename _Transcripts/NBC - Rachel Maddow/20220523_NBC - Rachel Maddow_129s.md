# GOP Congressman Walks Back Denial Of Capitol Tour Ahead Of Jan. 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58)
*  So, Thursday last week was the day the January 6th investigation said, hey, Congressman Laudermilk, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=0.0s)]
*  we'd like to talk to you, because you've led a tour on January 5th. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=8.24s)]
*  In response, he released a new statement that, contrary to his earlier denials, he now admits [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=11.88s)]
*  he did lead a tour of the Capitol complex on January 5th. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  He admitted that in print on Thursday. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=21.56s)]
*  Then on Friday, he released a video saying that he was only being persecuted for giving [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=24.12s)]
*  that tour that he previously denied. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=28.66s)]
*  He was only being persecuted for it because the people on the tour were wearing red baseball hats. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=30.66s)]
*  On January 5th, I took a family with young children and their guests who were visiting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  Washington to lunch in a cafeteria in one of the House Office buildings. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=42.42s)]
*  So what was so awful about this family that caused the committee to make false accusations [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=47.94s)]
*  about them? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  Well, some were actually wearing red baseball caps. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=53.3s)]
*  A family with young children and also their guests was the tour that you led on the 5th, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=58.62s)]
*  and they were wearing red caps, you say. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=64.62s)]
*  First, he said there were no tours given, and anybody who said there was a tour should [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=66.34s)]
*  be reported to the Ethics Committee and investigated. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=69.7s)]
*  Then the further detail that if there was a tour, which there wasn't, definitely no [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  one was on such a tour wearing a red MAGA baseball cap. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  Now it turns out, yeah, there was at least the tour led by him, the tour he led of all [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=80.82s)]
*  the people wearing the red caps. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=85.02s)]
*  Congressman Barry Loudermilk got caught out by the investigation on this on Thursday. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=88.02s)]
*  He copped to it on that video on Friday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=93.02s)]
*  Then guess what happened on Saturday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  Guess what happened next. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=97.38s)]
*  You probably guessed this too. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  Statement from Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=101.78s)]
*  Quote, Barry Loudermilk has my complete and total endorsement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlNFAswYF58&t=102.97999999999999s)]
