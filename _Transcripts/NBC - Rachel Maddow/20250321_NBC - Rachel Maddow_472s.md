# Missed Social Security checks no big deal to Trump commerce secretary as attacks on agency escalate
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ)
*  My whole adult life we have thought of attacking Social Security is the third rail of American politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You touch it and it is a guaranteed political death. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, we are now witnessing the strongest test we've ever had of that aphorism, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  as Donald Trump grabs that third rail firmly and unmistakably. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=12.8s)]
*  Trump has announced plans to fire thousands of people who work at the Social Security Administration, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=16.8s)]
*  more than 12% of its staff. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=22.0s)]
*  He has released plans to shut down dozens of local Social Security offices across the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Simultaneously, Trump is also making changes that will force millions more people to have to go to Social Security offices in person, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=29.4s)]
*  rather than dealing with the agency over the phone as they can now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=37.4s)]
*  That means millions more elderly people and people with disabilities will be forced to somehow make their way physically to a Social Security office in person, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=41.4s)]
*  if they can find one because they're closing lots of offices, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=52.4s)]
*  because they will need to get help in person from a Social Security staffer, provided they can find one who hasn't been fired. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=55.4s)]
*  The Trump administration also wants to give Elon Musk's group of Doge staffers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=62.4s)]
*  access to Social Security's database of incredibly sensitive personal information. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=68.4s)]
*  As we covered here on the show last night, for now a judge has blocked Doge from getting that information. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=73.4s)]
*  Today, Trump's acting director of Social Security responded to that ruling by throwing a tantrum and saying, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=79.4s)]
*  if that ruling stands, he will shut down the Social Security Administration altogether. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=85.4s)]
*  And you don't have to be among the 70-plus million Americans who currently receive Social Security to be mad about any of that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=93.4s)]
*  Making grandma wait in new lines is not nice, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=101.4s)]
*  Making people check themselves out of the hospital or the nursing home to somehow make their way to a faraway office [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=105.4s)]
*  that hasn't been shut to wait for hours to do something they used to be able to do on the phone, it's not nice, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=112.4s)]
*  Pitching a fit and saying you'll just shut down the whole administration is not nice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=118.4s)]
*  It ought to be obvious, right? Nobody needs to spell that out for you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=123.4s)]
*  Unless you're Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=126.4s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this today. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=131.4s)]
*  I feel like in any other moment this would have been wallpaper all over the American media. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=133.4s)]
*  But this statement today from Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary about what Trump is doing to Social Security, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=140.4s)]
*  this tape is such a political disaster, I feel like I almost have to close my eyes because I can't bear to watch it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=145.4s)]
*  Just, here you go, check it out. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=153.4s)]
*  Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=160.4s)]
*  My mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=165.4s)]
*  She just wouldn't. She thinks something got messed up and she'll get it next month. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=170.4s)]
*  A fraudster always makes the loudest noise screaming, yelling and complaining. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=175.4s)]
*  Howard Lutnick, Wall Street Titan, Trump cabinet member, saying that his mother-in-law wouldn't call and complain. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=183.4s)]
*  She'd just wait until next month, see if her check came in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=194.4s)]
*  Anybody complaining about not getting a check is obviously a criminal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=197.4s)]
*  How does that comport with what you understand of the reality of getting a Social Security check? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=204.4s)]
*  And who in your life, you know, gets a Social Security check? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=210.4s)]
*  Mr. Lutnick went on to say that anybody like Elon Musk, who had been inside a payment system like PayPal, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=214.4s)]
*  quote, knows the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen, because whoever screams is the one stealing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=220.4s)]
*  This is not like a random podcaster, dude. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=232.4s)]
*  This is cabinet official in the Trump administration while they are devastating Social Security. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=235.4s)]
*  Maybe it gets easier if you hear it again. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=242.4s)]
*  Here's one more time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=244.4s)]
*  Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=247.4s)]
*  My mother-in-law, who's 94, she wouldn't call and complain. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=253.4s)]
*  She just wouldn't. She thinks something got messed up and she'll get it next month. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=258.4s)]
*  A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=263.4s)]
*  And if all the guys who did PayPal, like Elon knows this by heart, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=271.4s)]
*  Anybody who's been in the payment system and the process system knows the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=276.4s)]
*  because whoever screams is the one stealing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=284.4s)]
*  He's talking about Social Security checks to elderly and disabled people. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=288.4s)]
*  Stop the payments and listen. Whoever screams, that's the one stealing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=292.4s)]
*  Try seeing that through the eyes of people, even just people in the news. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=300.4s)]
*  Maybe you can't imagine real human beings that you've met, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=304.4s)]
*  But try seeing it through the eyes of people in the news whose Social Security checks have, for one reason or another, been cut off [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=307.4s)]
*  and who are not the mother-in-law of the Commerce Secretary for Donald Trump. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=313.4s)]
*  For instance, take Ned Johnson of Seattle. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=317.4s)]
*  You might have seen his story going around this week after it was written up in the Seattle Times. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=320.4s)]
*  Ned Johnson was very mistakenly declared deceased by the Social Security Administration. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=324.4s)]
*  It was just a mistake. He is not dead. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=330.4s)]
*  Here's the headline in the Seattle Times. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=333.4s)]
*  Here's a quote dead person on Social Security in Seattle with plenty to say. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=334.4s)]
*  After this mistaken classification, the bank then deducted $5,201 in Social Security deposits from his family bank account. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=339.4s)]
*  Mr. Johnson is 82 years old. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=349.4s)]
*  He spent nearly three weeks on the phone, followed by four hours in person before he could straighten it out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=351.4s)]
*  And even though he himself could handle the interruption in his Social Security check, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=358.4s)]
*  Mr. Johnson said he understood what could be at stake for other people. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=363.4s)]
*  He said, quote, When I was in that line, I was thinking that if I was living solely off Social Security, I could be close to dumpster diving about now. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=367.4s)]
*  Or consider James McCaffrey of Oklahoma City. His benefits were also cut off by mistake. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=376.4s)]
*  And even though he, too, financially could handle the interruption, he says he understood that for other people, this would be a severe crisis. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=381.4s)]
*  You interrupt that for seven days, two weeks or even longer, and they're in bad trouble. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=391.4s)]
*  They could be out of a house. They could be out of food. I don't know. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=399.4s)]
*  It ought to be obvious, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=406.4s)]
*  The right way to approach the needs and expectations and earned earned income earned of millions of retired and disabled people, right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=408.4s)]
*  They have they have good reason now to be worried about their checks, not least because the administration is hacking away at government on a daily basis. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=419.4s)]
*  No one should need to spell out for you, right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=425.4s)]
*  At least what you ought to say and not to say. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=428.4s)]
*  But here's Howard Lutnick saying these people don't really need that money. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=431.4s)]
*  If any of them complain when we cut it off, which we should, then you know they're criminals. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=435.4s)]
*  This should haunt the Trump administration, and it may already be starting to. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=441.4s)]
*  You [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavEmJSqJVQ&t=471.4s)]
