# Trump reportedly keen on law at root of disgraceful chapter in American history
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc)
*  In 1942, there was a Boy Scout troop in Cody, Wyoming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you've ever been in Boy Scouts, or if you've ever had a kid, or in my case, a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=7.8s)]
*  brother in Boy Scouts, you might know that the big day on the calendar is, say with me [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=11.66s)]
*  now, Boy Scout Jamboree. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=16.56s)]
*  In 1942, in Wyoming, a Boy Scout troop put out a call to all the nearby Boy Scout troops [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=19.82s)]
*  and all the nearby towns that they should get together to do the Boy Scout Jamboree [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=26.7s)]
*  that year, which is like merit badge stuff and tying knots and digging ditches and making [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=30.72s)]
*  campfires, pitching tents and camping out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=36.9s)]
*  It's all that stuff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=38.94s)]
*  But in 1942 in Wyoming, when this one troop put out the call for the Jamboree, the other [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=40.6s)]
*  Boy Scout troops in the area did not respond or they said no. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=44.82s)]
*  Only one local Boy Scout troop in Cody, Wyoming, said yes, they would do it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  The reason everybody else said no, or they didn't bother to answer, is because the Boy [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=56.28s)]
*  Scout troop that put out the call for the Jamboree was the one inside Heart Mountain, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  behind the barbed wire at the internment camp at Heart Mountain, Wyoming. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=68.34s)]
*  It's basically a concentration camp where Japanese Americans had been forcibly relocated [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=72.88s)]
*  by the U.S. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=79.0s)]
*  Government at the start of World War II. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=80.0s)]
*  Guard towers, barbed wire, soldiers with guns, policing the perimeter, the whole thing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=84.28s)]
*  But that one Boy Scout troop from Cody, that's the one local troop that agreed to come to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=91.2s)]
*  Heart Mountain to do a Scout Jamboree with the other Boy Scout troop there of Japanese [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=95.64s)]
*  American boys. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=100.66s)]
*  And they did all the Jamboree stuff. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=102.14s)]
*  They did the merit badge stuff. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  They tied knots. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=104.64s)]
*  They set up tents. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=105.64s)]
*  And they matched boys up from the two different troops. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=107.4s)]
*  There were two particularly rambunctious, sort of, you might call them rowdy boys, one [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=110.56s)]
*  from each troop. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=115.56s)]
*  A kid from Cody, whose name was Alan, and a kid from Heart Mountain, who was named Norman. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=116.56s)]
*  And those two particularly rowdy kids, they ended up putting them together. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=122.36s)]
*  They camped together in the same tent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=128.36s)]
*  And they very quickly came up with a scheme together. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=131.18s)]
*  Because see, there was this other kid from the Cody troop who Alan really didn't like. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=134.08s)]
*  He said he was a bully. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=137.28s)]
*  He really didn't like that kid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=138.28s)]
*  And so he enlisted his new tent mate, this kid from Heart Mountain, Norman. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=139.72s)]
*  He enlisted him in a plan. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=143.78s)]
*  They thought that rain was going to be coming that night when they were camping out in their [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=147.32s)]
*  tent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  And so the two of them, Alan and Norman, who had just met, they very carefully dug a moat [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  around their own tent with a channel that led off the moat and downhill. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=157.68s)]
*  And the channel was aimed right at the tent of the kid who was the bully. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=163.96s)]
*  And then in the middle of the night, sure enough, the rain came down, the moat filled [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=171.08s)]
*  up, and then the channel off the moat worked. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=175.68s)]
*  And that downstream tent got inundated with all the rainwater from Alan and Norman's moat, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=180.32s)]
*  and the bully's tent collapsed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  And Alan and Norman collapsed in gleeful laughter at the prank they had pulled. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  And having pulled that off, Alan and Norman became lifelong friends. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=193.38s)]
*  That was a very unusual Boy Scout jamboree at Heart Mountain internment camp in 1942. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=198.98s)]
*  More than 40 years later, in 1988, that little kid Alan from Cody was now Republican U.S. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=207.38s)]
*  Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=214.3s)]
*  And that little kid Norman from Heart Mountain, he was now Democratic Congressman Norm Mineta. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=217.1s)]
*  And together in 1988, they convened bipartisan hearings on the legally, strategically, and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  morally disastrous decisions that led to 120,000 Japanese Americans, some of them citizens, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=231.78s)]
*  some of them not, being forced out of their homes and forcibly relocated into prison camps. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=238.94000000000003s)]
*  Alan Simpson and Norman Mineta drafted the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, which was signed [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  into law by a president named Ronald Reagan. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=253.06s)]
*  And that said that the internment of Japanese Americans in this country, which had been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=256.54s)]
*  done under a law that dated back to the 1700s, a rarely used legal authority, that law signed [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  by Ronald Reagan in 1988, the Civil Liberties Act, said that the internment of Japanese [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=271.0s)]
*  Americans had been based on racial prejudice and war hysteria and a failure of political leadership. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=275.78s)]
*  1988 Civil Liberties Act formally apologized on behalf of the United States of America [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=283.46s)]
*  to Japanese Americans for what we had done to them. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=289.34s)]
*  And it paid them reparations just to try to make it right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=292.97999999999996s)]
*  The legal grounds for interning Japanese Americans in World War II was something called the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  Alien Enemies Act of 1798. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=305.18s)]
*  That was only the third time it had ever been used in American history. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=308.3s)]
*  It had been used in the War of 1812. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  It had been used in World War I. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=314.26s)]
*  And it had been used for Japanese internment in World War II. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=316.98s)]
*  Last night, we started to see headlines like this one at The Wall Street Journal, quote, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=323.32s)]
*  Trump to invoke seldom used wartime law from 1798. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=327.74s)]
*  This one from CBS News. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=334.02s)]
*  Professor says Trump's plan to invoke Alien Enemies Act of 1798 sidesteps immigration laws. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=335.42s)]
*  And then inevitably, because of the history of that law, we started to see last night [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=344.14s)]
*  headlines like this from the ABC affiliate in San Diego in this case. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  Japanese Americans react to Trump's plan to invoke Alien Enemies Act. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=353.78s)]
*  And then this morning, we got the news that Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming died today [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=360.7s)]
*  in Cody, Wyoming, where he was from. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=366.5s)]
*  He was 93 years old. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=368.97999999999996s)]
*  President Donald Trump gave a speech today at the U.S. Justice Department, which itself [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  is a rare thing for a president to do. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  In that speech, he was expected. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  White House sources had made clear to lots of reporters that President Trump was expected [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=382.26s)]
*  to announce at that speech that he is going to invoke the Japanese internment law. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=387.34s)]
*  He is going to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which, again, has only ever been [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=392.8s)]
*  used three times before in our country and always in wartime. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  And the last time we used it, men like Norman Netta and Alan Simpson and freaking Ronald [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=401.74s)]
*  Reagan ended up moving the nation to apologize for it, to call it a stain on our national [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=406.5s)]
*  honor and not only to formally apologize, but to pay reparations for what we have done. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=412.34s)]
*  Trump wants to do it again. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=420.78s)]
*  According to multiple White House sources in speaking with multiple reporters at multiple [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=424.02s)]
*  agents, multiple news agencies, that said Trump didn't announce it at the Justice Department [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=429.1s)]
*  at his speech today. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=434.98s)]
*  And he might have meant to. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=435.98s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=437.3s)]
*  His speech went completely off the rails. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=438.3s)]
*  He started giving what sounded like orders to Justice Department officials in the room [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=440.7s)]
*  that they should go after a government watchdog group, crew, that has brought lawsuits against [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=444.7s)]
*  his administration, the Justice Department should act against them somehow. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=450.62s)]
*  And for something, he started to say that the Justice Department should go after CNN [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=454.86s)]
*  and should go after MSNBC and should go after a whole big list of people he sees as his [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=461.22s)]
*  enemies. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=465.5s)]
*  So his speech, who knows how much of that was written and how much of it was just him [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=466.66s)]
*  being moved in the moment. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=471.66s)]
*  He got so wound up about telling the Justice Department individually to go after his enemies [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=473.38s)]
*  today that maybe he forgot the part about let's rerun Japanese internment. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=477.98s)]
*  But presumably that's coming. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=485.94s)]
*  I'm assuming that it'll come in some midnight or 4 a.m. announcement or some misspelled [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=487.34s)]
*  all capital letters, truth social post or something. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=491.82s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyR3-3qbQxc&t=495.82s)]
