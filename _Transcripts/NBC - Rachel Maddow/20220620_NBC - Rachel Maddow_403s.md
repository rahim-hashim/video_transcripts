# Republican Rebuffed Trump, Sounded Alarm On 'Breathtaking' Fake Elector Scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ)
*  I think it's worth knowing that Rusty Bowers, again, a witness you'll hear from live tomorrow, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=0.0s)]
*  he is, in one particular and important way, he is everything that Bill Barr and Mike Pence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=5.44s)]
*  and all these other supposed heroes of this story are not. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=12.24s)]
*  However much people like Attorney General Bill Barr or Vice President Pence have been [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=17.32s)]
*  lauded over the course of this investigation, because at the very, very end, when it came [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  in the final, final, final accounting, they didn't ultimately go along with the last, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=27.76s)]
*  worst thing that Trump asked them to do. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=32.28s)]
*  However much they are being lauded for not being as bad as Trump and not being willing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=34.6s)]
*  to do everything he wanted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=39.88s)]
*  One thing that neither of those men did in the moment, not Bill Barr, not Vice President [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=43.68s)]
*  Pence, not Trump lawyer Eric Hirschman, not Pence lawyer Greg Jacob, not Trump campaign [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=47.68s)]
*  manager Bill Stepien, not any of these guys we have heard from thus far. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=52.64s)]
*  They're all taking their bows now for not putting on a Viking hat and smashing windows [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=57.28s)]
*  with the rest of the mob on January 6th, and good for them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=61.24s)]
*  But one thing that none of them did in the moment was tell us, tell the public what was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=64.28s)]
*  happening in the White House that they were so disturbed about. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=70.82s)]
*  None of them was willing to sound the alarm in the moment to say, hey, the president is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=73.92s)]
*  trying to get people to do something illegal here, and we're worried it's going to get [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  people killed on January 6th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=81.44s)]
*  None of them went to the public with their concerns in real time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=84.0s)]
*  But you know who did do that in real time? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=87.88s)]
*  The Arizona very conservative Republican Speaker of the House, Rusty Bowers, who is going to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=91.32s)]
*  testify tomorrow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=97.08s)]
*  Again, I have no idea what he will be like as a witness or what he will testify to. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=98.08s)]
*  But the historical record will show that he actually got this part of it right when almost [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=102.18s)]
*  nobody else did. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=108.06s)]
*  As he was getting calls from President Trump himself and from Rudy Giuliani and from all [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=110.44s)]
*  these other people in the president's orbit, Rusty Bowers not only didn't go along with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=114.56s)]
*  their demands that he should throw out Arizona's election results, he, kind of alone among [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  all these guys, is the one who put out a press release telling everybody that actually that's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=124.4s)]
*  what they were pressuring him to do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=130.84s)]
*  They were pressuring him to overturn the state's election results, and that's wrong, and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=132.46s)]
*  he needed everybody to know it in the moment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=135.72s)]
*  Look at this document. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=138.36s)]
*  This is what you show St. Peter at the pearly gates. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=139.68s)]
*  This is your hall pass for up there at the end of your life as a public official if your [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=142.0s)]
*  name is Rusty Bowers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=146.12s)]
*  See the date on it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=149.08s)]
*  That's a very important date. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=150.08s)]
*  December 4th, 2020 for immediate release. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=151.8s)]
*  Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers today made the following statement, quote, This week, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=155.52s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and others representing President Donald Trump came to Arizona with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  a breathtaking request that the Arizona legislature overturn the certified results of last month's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=164.28s)]
*  election and deliver the state's electoral college votes to President Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=169.6s)]
*  The rule of law forbids us to do that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Ellis made their case here at least twice on Monday at an unofficial [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  public gathering hosted by a small group of legislators and again on Tuesday during a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=180.4s)]
*  closed door meeting at the state Capitol with Republican leaders from both chambers of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=184.92s)]
*  legislatures. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=189.76s)]
*  Both times the Trump team made claims that the election was tainted by fraud, but presented [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  only theories, not proof. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=195.88s)]
*  Again, keep in mind what's going on here, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=198.72s)]
*  This this this is the one dog that barked. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  He is alerting the public to the fact that there's been an unofficial gathering between [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=205.64s)]
*  Republican legislators and people from the Trump campaign. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=210.2s)]
*  And then following that, a closed door meeting between Republican leaders and the state legislature [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=213.6s)]
*  and people from the Trump campaign. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=218.16s)]
*  And this guy, the Republican House Speaker says, hey, this might be happening behind [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=219.92s)]
*  But the public needs to know about this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=224.1s)]
*  I'm going public. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=225.7s)]
*  I'm going to tell the public what's going on here and also that I'm not going to stand [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  for it. I'm not going to go along with it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  He says, quote, Even if such evidence existed, the Arizona legislature simply couldn't do [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=233.94s)]
*  what is being asked under Arizona law. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  Presidential electors must vote for the winners of the popular vote. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=241.98s)]
*  Nothing in the U.S. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=244.9s)]
*  Constitution or the decisions of the U.S. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=245.82s)]
*  Supreme Court even suggests that the Arizona legislature could retroactively appoint different [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  electors who would cast their ballots for different candidates. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=252.38s)]
*  The law does not authorize the legislature to reverse the results of the election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=256.66s)]
*  As a conservative Republican, I don't like the results of the presidential election. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=260.74s)]
*  I voted for President Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=264.82s)]
*  I worked hard to reelect him, but I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=266.1s)]
*  violate the law to change the outcome of a certified election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=270.54s)]
*  I and my fellow legislators swore an oath to support the U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=274.46s)]
*  Constitution and the laws of the state of Arizona. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=277.3s)]
*  It would violate that oath, the basic principles of Republican government and the rule of law [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=280.5s)]
*  if we attempted to nullify the people's vote based on unsupported theories of fraud. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=285.73999999999995s)]
*  Arizona voters choose who wins, and our system requires that their choice be respected. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  He then concludes with this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=295.82s)]
*  Forty years ago next month, President Ronald Reagan reminded us that while the orderly [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  transfer of authority is a commonplace occurrence for Americans, quote, In the eyes of many [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  in the world, this every four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=307.14s)]
*  Rusty Bowers concludes, quote, Now Americans are being reminded once again never to take [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=313.5s)]
*  for granted what President Reagan correctly described as the continuity, which is the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=318.18s)]
*  bulwark of our republic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=322.34s)]
*  Again, look at the date on that, December 4th, 2020. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=326.46s)]
*  That's more than a month before the January 6th attack. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  The Republican House Speaker in Arizona saying, Yeah, I want to Trump to win. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=333.14s)]
*  I voted for Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=337.18s)]
*  But here he is, sounding the alarm, telling the public that what the Trump campaign was [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=338.46s)]
*  asking for behind closed doors was blatantly illegal. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=341.9s)]
*  He went to the public. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=346.14s)]
*  He said, This is breathtaking. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=347.14s)]
*  That's the word he used. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=348.14s)]
*  A breathtaking request. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  Telling the public no way would he do it and correctly saying that what Trump was asking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=351.62s)]
*  for and the fact that he was asking for it would be the end of the peaceful transition [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=355.76s)]
*  of power in our country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=360.86s)]
*  Rusty Bowers was right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  And almost no one else in Republican politics was willing to tell that truth to the public [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=364.14s)]
*  about it at that point. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=369.5s)]
*  All these people who are sort of getting it right in retrospect, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  He got it right in the moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmk1vLuHtjQ&t=376.4s)]
