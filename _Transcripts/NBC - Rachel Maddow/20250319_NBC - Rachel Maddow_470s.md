Video Description: New changes to Social Security being implemented at the end of March are seen as a way of degrading services and dismantling the agency without technically implementing "cuts" in payments. Rep. John Larson talks with Rachel Maddow about the upset he hears from constituents over concerns about Donald Trump's threat to Social Security, and demands Democrats in Congress have made to hear directly from Trump officials, including Elon Musk, on proof of the "waste, fraud and abuse" that is supposedly being cut from federal programs like Social Security.

# 'The plan is to scuttle the agency': Democrats demand answers from Musk on Social Security cuts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM)
*  For weeks now, town hall after town hall, one question, one topic comes up again and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=0.0s)]
*  again and again at every single one of these Q&A sessions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=5.92s)]
*  And it's one of those issues that, again, you just can't be on the wrong side of in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=10.36s)]
*  American politics. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=13.6s)]
*  But Republicans are this year, thanks to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=15.84s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=20.96s)]
*  Our next question is from Polly from a 288 zip code area. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=21.96s)]
*  What are you doing to ensure the protection of our Social Security benefits? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=27.48s)]
*  Good question. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=32.24s)]
*  I really want to know from you, will you protect Social Security in its current form? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Next question, what are your plans to cut Social Security? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  I want to be very, this is a very easy question for me to answer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=45.24s)]
*  Any changes to Social Security are not on the table and I will not cut your Social Security. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=47.92s)]
*  It is a promise between you and the federal government. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=54.4s)]
*  Social Security is a promise between you and the federal government. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=58.96s)]
*  Congressman Mike Flood doing his best yesterday in Nebraska and you could hear his constituents [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=62.12s)]
*  reacting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  If his constituents are feeling a little insecure about Social Security, there's good reason [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=69.0s)]
*  for that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=72.8s)]
*  In addition to Social Security firing thousands of people who work at that agency and announcing [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=73.8s)]
*  plans to shut down dozens of Social Security field offices, the agency now plans to put [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=78.32s)]
*  new requirements in place that will send millions more people to local offices in person [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=83.92s)]
*  if they can find one instead of being able to solve things with the administration over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=90.88s)]
*  the phone. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=96.28s)]
*  An internal memo from top officials at Social Security says 75 to 85,000 more people each [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=97.6s)]
*  week, senior citizens and disabled people, will have to deal with their Social Security [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=103.54s)]
*  benefits in person because of the changes Trump is making. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  75 to 85,000 more customers in person per week while the agency is shutting down offices [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=113.48s)]
*  and firing their staff. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=119.84s)]
*  These new rules are no longer just proposals. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  They are apparently set to take effect March 31st, a week and a half from now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=125.08s)]
*  Look at the empty seats here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Where's Elon Musk? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=133.0s)]
*  If he's so great, if these plans and all the fraud and abuse that he found are so eminent, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=134.0s)]
*  why isn't he here explaining it? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=141.08s)]
*  You know why. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  Because he's out to privatize Social Security. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  He's been on television the last couple of days talking exactly about Social Security, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=151.68s)]
*  Medicare and Medicaid and what he intends to do. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  Privatize it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=163.24s)]
*  The American people, some of them may have been born at night, but not last night. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=164.24s)]
*  They will teach that clip in freshman orientation for new members of Congress, if there's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=170.9s)]
*  any justice in the world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=175.3s)]
*  The moment when Connecticut Democratic Congressman John Larson pretty much burned down the barn [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  over the issue of Social Security and what Trump and his top campaign donor are doing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=181.26s)]
*  to it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=185.9s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=186.9s)]
*  I really appreciate taking the time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  Glad to be with you, Rachel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for your voice. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=192.94s)]
*  Well, let me ask you about your voice. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  You gave a real clarion call. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=197.38s)]
*  In Congress last week, we highlighted that here on the show. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=199.78s)]
*  I wanted to ask what you are hearing from your constituents. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=202.18s)]
*  I know you just had a town hall and I know you got a lot of attention for those remarks. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I did just have a good one. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=208.38s)]
*  The same thing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=209.38s)]
*  There's frustration across the country and in the districts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=210.38s)]
*  Most of the time it's individuals saying, look, we don't hear enough from Congress, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=214.9s)]
*  even though I assure you and I think you know this, how hard everyone's working, etc. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=219.62s)]
*  But this particular proposal that they had was a resolution that actually started back [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=225.18s)]
*  in the 1799 and was modified in 1879, which provides a check for the legislative branch [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  on the executive branch. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  The resolution of inquiry requires that they take the bill up within 14 days or the bill [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=246.22s)]
*  goes directly to the floor for a vote. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=253.54s)]
*  So what the Republicans did was adjourn the Congress on Tuesday night, hold a meeting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=256.22s)]
*  Monday morning early with little people there and clearly, as you saw from the clip, no [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=262.3s)]
*  Elon Musk and no head of the Social Security Administration. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=267.94s)]
*  And the outrage here is what they're doing and the fact that they think that Elon Musk [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=272.02s)]
*  is above the law and that he doesn't have to come before the United States Congress [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=277.66s)]
*  or the Ways and Means Committee. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=283.18s)]
*  I think my Republican colleagues were embarrassed by this fact, but we're going to keep it up. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=286.06s)]
*  Rich Neal was in the papers again today calling for another, you know, motion of inquiry so [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=290.1s)]
*  that we get Elon Musk before the committee and demand answers for the American people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=295.70000000000005s)]
*  What do you think they are trying to do to Social Security? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=303.94000000000005s)]
*  The changes that they are forcing through that they now say are going to start the last [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=306.66s)]
*  day of this month seem like they are changes that are designed to cause chaos, designed [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  to cause breakdown and designed to screw up the basic functions of the agency. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=316.66s)]
*  To what end? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=321.9s)]
*  What do you think they're doing? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=322.9s)]
*  I think you hit the nail on the head with the hammer there, Rachel, because that's exactly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=325.02s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=330.06s)]
*  And here's the goal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=332.02s)]
*  What they're trying to do is say in the committee that Trump's indicated that he's not going [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=333.3s)]
*  to touch Social Security and the Republicans continue to repeat, and all Elon Musk is after [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=338.14s)]
*  is fraud, abuse and waste. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=344.58s)]
*  Well, if he is, bring it before us because we'd like to hear it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=347.02s)]
*  In fact, bring him before us so we get to see his plan. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  The plan, unlike previous plans to privatize Social Security, is to scuttle the agencies [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=356.02s)]
*  themselves. Social Security already is trimmed and has an administrative operating [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=362.26s)]
*  cost of under one percent. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=368.3s)]
*  There's no other agency in the federal government that operates like that, or I dare say in [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=371.22s)]
*  the private sector, either from an insurance capital of the world. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=375.82s)]
*  And the administrative costs are 16 to 26 percent. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=380.1s)]
*  So what they're up to is to scuttle the agency, make it appear that it's not working and not [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=384.82s)]
*  answering people's concerns and then passing legislation that's unpaid for draining [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=391.14s)]
*  the Social Security Trust Fund. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=398.9s)]
*  When Trump charges him with finding two trillion dollars, everybody's attention should go [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=401.14s)]
*  up when you look at the Social Security Trust Fund, which is two trillion seven hundred [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=407.38s)]
*  billion. And so he's made no bones about it on Larry Kudlow or any other place that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=413.62s)]
*  they're going to privatize it. And then they deny that in front of the committee and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=419.66s)]
*  won't bring him in front of the Ways and Means Committee to face the public and to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  face the questions that Congress has. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=432.14000000000004s)]
*  Congressman John Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, please come back and talk to us about [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=436.14000000000004s)]
*  this. I know you're not going to let it go. Thank you, sir. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=440.74s)]
*  I look forward to it, Rachel. Thank you so much. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=442.86s)]
*  All right. Of course, we'll be right back. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzmsvG1qDqM&t=445.34000000000003s)]
