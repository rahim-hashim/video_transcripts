# 'Combative': See Rachel Maddow and colleagues react to Joe Biden's interview with NBC's Lester Holt
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0)
*  President Biden sitting down today with NBC News anchor Lester Holt in a combative and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=0.0s)]
*  feisty interview. Lester, look, why don't you guys ever talk about the 28 lies he told? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=7.0s)]
*  Where were you on this? Why doesn't the press ever talk about that? 28 times it's confirmed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=12.52s)]
*  he lied in that debate. What's with you guys? Come on. I'm on the horse. Where have you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=16.64s)]
*  been? Even at the end there. Yeah, come back and we'll talk about the stuff that matters. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=21.92s)]
*  We'll talk about the issues, meaning stop asking me about me and about these politics. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=25.68s)]
*  Our colleague Lawrence O'Donnell joins us. Hi, Lawrence. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=30.4s)]
*  Hi. That was Lester Holt doing Lester Holt and Joe Biden doing Joe Biden. And, you know, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=33.56s)]
*  look, it should be obvious enough there. Maybe it isn't that Joe Biden really likes Lester Holt [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=39.84s)]
*  and thinks he admires his work. I didn't think that was a combative interview. I thought that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  was Biden having to respond to questions that were challenges and he responded to them, you know, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=52.6s)]
*  his way. I mean combative in the sense that he was he was punchy. He was there to be like, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=58.24s)]
*  yeah, yeah, well, response. He was like, yeah, close to the net and tennis sort of a thing. Yeah. And [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=62.68s)]
*  he knew he knows he has to do that. But, you know, the one thing that he can't erase from any of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=68.52s)]
*  these interviews is how old he is. And it's just that's the fact. I've always known that's how old [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=74.6s)]
*  he is. I knew what his age was five years ago. I knew what it would be now. I knew his voice was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=78.88s)]
*  going to sound like it's going to sound weaker. It's the way it happens. His voice is going to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=83.44s)]
*  be softer, weaker. But, you know, the question that Lester was really there when this was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=86.92s)]
*  originally scheduled, what he was really there to ask about and find out about is has the storm [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=92.84s)]
*  passed? That was the real question. There's only one person who knows the answer to that because [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=99.44s)]
*  there's only one person who decides and that's Joe Biden. And for Joe Biden, the storm passed as [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=104.44s)]
*  soon as it started because he just said, no, I'm staying in this race. He's never wavered from that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=109.2s)]
*  And so, you know, this this is where we are with that tonight. I don't think anything changed on [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=115.32s)]
*  that. I don't think anything about that interview is going to change anyone's ability to change Joe [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Biden's mind. He asked him the question that I think I've heard a lot in just offline personal [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=128.68s)]
*  conversations about this with people just in my life, not in the news business, which was, who do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=133.88s)]
*  you listen to on deeply personal issues like the decisions whether to stay in the race or not? I [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=139.72s)]
*  can't tell you the number of like handicapping decisions I've had with people about whether he [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=144.28s)]
*  only listens to his wife or he only listens to whatever that advisor is, nobody can ever remember [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=148.32s)]
*  the name of, or he only listens to his son or whatever. And his answer was as short as it could [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=152.92s)]
*  possibly be. Who do you listen to on deeply personal issues like the decisions whether to stay in the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  race or not? Pause. Me. Me. Look, I've been doing this a long time. The idea that I'm the old guy, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=161.84s)]
*  I am. I'm old, but I'm only three years older than Trump, number one. And number two, my mental [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=168.72s)]
*  acuity has been pretty damn good. I've gotten more done than any president has in a long, long time [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=172.72s)]
*  in three and a half years. So I'm willing to be judged on that. I understand. I understand why [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=177.28s)]
*  people say, God, he's 81 years old. Whoa, what's it going to be like when he's 83 year old, 83 years [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=182.16s)]
*  old or 84 years old? It's a legitimate question to ask. I mean, I think what we're seeing here is that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=187.0s)]
*  there is somewhat of a time lag between the news cycle and the subject of the news cycle. You know, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  I think to Lawrence's point for Joe Biden, the thing that's relevant today is the campaign as it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=199.56s)]
*  is today. And there's still a news cycle that is still in two, what is it, two weeks ago or three [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=206.04s)]
*  weeks ago and the question of whether he stays on the ballot. And so Joe Biden, I think, expressed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=211.88s)]
*  some annoyance with the media for staying in that mode when he's ready to keep combating [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=217.56s)]
*  like the battle at hand. And so I think there is just this lag and I'm not sure if he can escape [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=223.32s)]
*  it because, I mean, people keep asking him the question he's answered already. And the reality is, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=228.44s)]
*  as Lawrence said, within the Democratic Party rules, there really is no way to force him out [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=234.12s)]
*  if he decides he ain't going. I just hope Lester got a date for that issues interview. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=240.2s)]
*  Like, when is that going to happen? Let's do that next Monday. This is live video right now of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=246.44s)]
*  President Biden arriving in Las Vegas. I mentioned that he's going to be doing that event with the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=250.44s)]
*  NAACP tomorrow that is in Las Vegas, Nevada. Again, the president and his campaign made the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=253.88s)]
*  decision in the immediate wake of the shooting on Saturday night in Pennsylvania to take down [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=259.64s)]
*  all of their political ads and also to cancel all political events. That does not mean that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=264.6s)]
*  the president cancels all events. He does lots of things as president that are on his official [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=270.36s)]
*  presidential schedule that don't have to do with the campaign. This NAACP event tomorrow and an [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  event with UNITUS US on Wednesday are both considered to be on sort of that side of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  ledger. So he's keeping up with those things. But it is actually interesting watching that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=285.0s)]
*  interview, right? Seeing sort of politics continuing on as usual. Nicole, I was thinking [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=289.88s)]
*  about you and your past role with presidential campaigns, thinking about I was actually [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=296.2s)]
*  remembering me buttonholing you at the Republican Convention in 2008 trying to get you to get [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=301.16s)]
*  John McCain to do an interview with me. You laughed in my face. But how big a deal would it have been? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=309.64s)]
*  I want to give some context to the laugh. It was because in John McCain, John McCain was such a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=315.4s)]
*  different figure than George W. Bush. George W. Bush, I don't think, had tracked Keith Olbermann's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  move from ESPN to cable news. And so he wouldn't have known the things being said about him. But [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=326.84s)]
*  John McCain watched. And so John McCain knew that on this network he was called the worst person. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  So I didn't laugh at you. I laughed because I knew how much news John McCain consumed and how hurt he [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=336.52s)]
*  was by some of the criticism. So I just can't let it stand that you would say that. And so you were [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=343.72s)]
*  laughing because ha ha, there's no way. Because Phil called me. Phil Griffin called me, was not my boss, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  right afterward. And I was like, no, yeah, I know she got me. I don't think so, but I will pass the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=354.44000000000005s)]
*  anyway. We need another hour to talk about how that went over. So right now at this point in the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  campaign, while the Republican Convention is going on, imagine, right, while the opponent, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  while the opponents, the opposing parties convention is going on, you pull all your [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=371.4s)]
*  campaign ads down indefinitely. Yeah, I wouldn't do that. But you know, you know, which party I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=376.12s)]
*  came from. I mean, look, I think that all I'm going to say about the interviews is all that I said [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=381.08s)]
*  during the entire Alvin Brad case in New York. We have no idea how the jury is processing any of these [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  bits of information. And the jury isn't us, not even close. The jury is the voters. And so I'm, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=394.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, to your point, though, the reason it's still in the news is because Thursday night, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=400.68s)]
*  in a riveting sweat all over my body, inducing appearance, Jim Himes came up and gave you he's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=403.8s)]
*  a patriot. What do you think of Jim Himes? He believes in the country. He believes in our [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  alliance with Ukraine. He has been there. He believes in our role in the world. And he says, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=413.56s)]
*  in no uncertain terms, loyalty destroyed the Republican Party and will not let it destroy mine. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  And so I don't see a path for him to win. And we can't squander our democracy on loyalty. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=422.91999999999996s)]
*  So the reason it's still a news story is because compelling people like Jim Himes are doing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=426.92s)]
*  compelling interviews with people like Alex Wagner. But in terms of what he and Lester [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=431.24s)]
*  talked about, the jury is the voters. And I have no idea how they'll experience that and no idea [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=436.6s)]
*  anymore. On the campaign's apparatus, it should raise its flag and keep campaigning because we [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=441.0s)]
*  have an election in 115 days. I was, you know, given the fact that they pulled their ads, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=448.12s)]
*  I thought he was surprisingly political in the interview. When asked about political violence [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=452.68s)]
*  and political violent rhetoric, Biden pivoted back to Charlottesville, explaining why he got [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  in the race, talked about Trump saying there are good people on both sides. He segue to January [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=463.24s)]
*  6, talking about what happened to the Capitol. I mean, at every opportunity, he goes back to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=467.24s)]
*  Trump's record being someone who has stoked and perhaps in the eyes of some incited violence [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=471.24s)]
*  directly. So he's not shying away from a political fight, at least rhetorically, when you hear it [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=477.24s)]
*  coming from the man, despite whatever his campaign is doing in this particular hour. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=482.44s)]
*  And I think it was important. I mean, he said, why wouldn't you talk about him being an [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=486.04s)]
*  existential threat? I mean, he's also, you know, putting his foot down and saying, no, we're not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=489.32s)]
*  going to stop talking about the threats to democracy, which I think will be heartening [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=495.0s)]
*  to people who are his voters, because I think what JD Vance and other folks on the Republican [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  side have tried to do is to preemptively come out and sort of threaten Democrats with becoming [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=506.04s)]
*  the ones who are purveying political violence. If they keep talking about Donald Trump as an [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=511.72s)]
*  existential threat to democracy, trying to sort of work the refs and say, well, you can't talk [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=516.52s)]
*  about that anymore because now that's inciting violence. I think what he said in this interview [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  tonight and three follow ups from Lester Holt, he really did say very firmly, you know, we're [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=525.0s)]
*  going to keep talking about these threats because they actually are threats. Lawrence, in terms of [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=529.48s)]
*  the president's overall performance and how he is handling what is still an ongoing storm [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=534.2s)]
*  within his own party and among his own supporters and among people even who love him, but who feel [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=541.16s)]
*  desperately that the Democrats need to give themselves the best chance of winning this [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=546.12s)]
*  election. How do you think that he is handling this type, this part of political combat that he now [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=549.48s)]
*  has to has to wage? Well, if you look at it in terms of his objective is to accept the nomination [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=555.4s)]
*  at the convention and give a rousing speech, he's handling it flawlessly from his end, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=562.92s)]
*  absolutely flawlessly. You certainly can't say the same for the other side, whatever that other [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loKDL47gZr0&t=567.72s)]
