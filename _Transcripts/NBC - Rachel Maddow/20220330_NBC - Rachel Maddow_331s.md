# For Ukraine, First Win On The Battlefield, Then Make Russia Pay
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s)
*  While the Ukrainian leader was soliciting more military aid from President Biden, an all-female [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=0.0s)]
*  delegation of Ukrainian members of parliament was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=4.96s)]
*  like this one with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. They're in D.C. asking for more sanctions and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=9.92s)]
*  weaponry like fighter jets to boost Ukraine's defenses. Their very presence is a reminder [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  of what's at stake. Yesterday, as the Ukrainian delegation asked for that desperately needed aid, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=20.48s)]
*  an air raid siren alert sounded from one of their cell phones. As it blared, one of the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=26.88s)]
*  Ukrainian lawmakers said, quote, I need you all to hear that. One of those Ukrainian lawmakers, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  the member of parliament, Yevhenia Kravchuk joins me now from Washington. Ms. Kravchuk, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=37.76s)]
*  thank you for making time to be here with us. The last I saw you was on Friday in Warsaw, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  and you were on your way. You've been meeting now with those lawmakers you told us about, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=47.76s)]
*  including the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. What kind of response are you getting? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=51.84s)]
*  MS. KRAVCHUK, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi You know, when I was watching this piece of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=57.36s)]
*  TV, I can't, you know, I just need to give this emotion. And there was an eight-years-old [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  girl drawing a chalk. Well, you know, I remember my daughter, who is eight years old, and, you know, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=67.12s)]
*  and she is in Ukraine right now, waiting for me to come, you know, with some sort of news saying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=74.4s)]
*  that, you know, America will help us. So that's basically the question that I've been asked from, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=81.28s)]
*  you know, everyone. So we do send our messages about the weapons, about the sanctions, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=87.12s)]
*  about the financial support. And we're really thankful for, for example, we've got the news [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=93.84s)]
*  that from President Biden saying that they're going to be half a billion of dollars sent to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=100.08s)]
*  Ukraine, to Ukrainian budget. So we, you know, we see we're getting there. But about weapons is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=106.56s)]
*  still, you know, we'll be satisfied when we'll have them on the ground. It can't be on the table. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=112.8s)]
*  MR. BENTON, U.S. Secretary of State for Ukraine and Ukraine's Defense Ministry [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=118.48s)]
*  Let's talk about the negotiations that are underway, the ones that have just ended in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=121.68s)]
*  Istanbul. There's a lot of doubt from the people I'm speaking to inside the country [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=127.04s)]
*  that these negotiations are meaningful and that the Russian side on this can be trusted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=131.36s)]
*  They said they're pulling back from Kiev and other places, and that has not turned out to be true. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=136.56s)]
*  What's your sense of whether these are meaningful negotiations and whether they should continue? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=142.0s)]
*  MS. TOLSTOVSKAYA, Russian Foreign Minister First, we do not believe Putin, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=146.96s)]
*  because Putin has done, you know, everything before violating his own words. So what we believe in is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=151.68s)]
*  our army, Ukrainian army and our soldiers. So we basically think that we need a victory on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=159.68s)]
*  the battlefield, and then we can drag altogether with civilized world Putin into the table of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  negotiations, because we do need to negotiate, for example, the reparation to restore Ukraine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=174.96s)]
*  But winning on the battlefield is essential. So that's why we've been asking for this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  battle jets, for this air defense system, for artillery, for tanks. You know, there's a big [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=188.48s)]
*  list sent to Pentagon, and we actually asked members of Congress, both from House of Representatives [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  and from the Senate, to sort of control how this list is going and how we're getting those weapons. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  MR. BENTON, U.S. Secretary of State for Ukraine's Defense and Defense [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  One of the things that you said to me in Warsaw that struck me is that you, like every other [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=212.64s)]
*  Ukrainian I've spoken to, has decided this will end and that Ukraine will sustain itself. And then [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=217.92s)]
*  you want the world to start talking about what happens next. You actually said to me it's going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=224.72s)]
*  to need something that looks like a Marshall Plan to rebuild Ukraine. Are you at the point where you [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=228.72s)]
*  can start to have that conversation with people, or is it too early right now, because, as you said, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine has to win on the battlefield first? MS. KURTULOVA, U.S. Secretary of State for Ukraine's Defense and Defense [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=238.32s)]
*  We do start this conversation. And also, in parallel, we're having conversations about [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=242.72s)]
*  international tribunal for Putin and for all of these military generals who've been giving the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=248.0s)]
*  orders to bomb the cities. I mean, that will be a separate track as well. But, yes, we will need a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=256.08s)]
*  new Marshall Plan for Ukraine. And I'm sure that United States will take a leading role in this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=264.08s)]
*  But, hey, there is so much Russian frozen money around the world from the Central Bank. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=270.64s)]
*  We should think about the way how to use it to restore Ukraine after the victory. But the first [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=277.36s)]
*  thing, what we need, we need to kick out Russians from our country, because there can't be any [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=285.76s)]
*  negotiations when somebody puts a gun to your head. MR. KURTULOVA, U.S. Secretary of State for Ukraine's Defense [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=292.88s)]
*  Yevhenia Kravchuk, thank you for joining us again. We appreciate that. I understand you are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=299.44s)]
*  continuing your travels and your efforts to get the world on your side. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=305.12s)]
*  Yevhenia Kravchuk is a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=308.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLpvXz6r_s&t=329.44s)]
