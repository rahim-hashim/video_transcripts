# Nazi Gatherings In Broad Daylight In Florida Spark Alarm
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk)
*  I'm going to show you a little local news report from Orlando, Florida this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just going to warn you right up front that some of the images and the speech in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=4.4s)]
*  this clip are gross and they could be upsetting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=7.24s)]
*  This contains some anti-Semitic and white supremacist blather that you might not want [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=12.3s)]
*  to hear or you might not want your kids to hear if you're watching with any kids. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=17.12s)]
*  So that is your fair warning if you do not want to hear it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=19.76s)]
*  But the reason I'm going to show it, even just a few seconds of it, is that it does [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=23.12s)]
*  us no good to pretend that this isn't happening. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=27.52s)]
*  And if you take a look at just a little bit of this, you will understand why the citizens [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=30.34s)]
*  of Orlando, Florida may be a little shaken up today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=33.98s)]
*  This is from News 6 Orlando. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=37.44s)]
*  Men and women with neo-Nazi armbands, flags and posters stood on the corner of this Waterford [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=43.44s)]
*  Lakes intersection on Saturday, shouting words of white supremacist hate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Orange County Sheriff's deputies confirm this video is part of their active and open [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=52.56s)]
*  investigation into the demonstration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=56.68s)]
*  And this part of the video, a fight in the street, investigators say, involved the demonstrators [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  and a passerby. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=64.4s)]
*  Also over the weekend, troopers broke up this demonstration of hate on an I-4 overpass in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Orlando telling News 6 it's illegal to obstruct traffic or hang signs on overpasses. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=70.76s)]
*  So that's two overt Nazi gatherings on two successive days this weekend out in broad [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=78.4s)]
*  daylight in central Florida at the shopping center, over the highway, just out harassing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=84.48s)]
*  the locals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=90.38000000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to show you a tiny bit more of that video that's part of the investigation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  by the Orange County Sheriff now in Florida. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  Because with this bit that I'm going to show you, you can get a sense of the way they were [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=99.64000000000001s)]
*  going after the locals and innocent bystanders trying to free people out, trying to provoke [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=102.92s)]
*  people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=107.68s)]
*  This is just a few seconds again, but I will warn you that it is it is a little gross. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=108.68s)]
*  Hello, what are you doing? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=114.0s)]
*  No more Jews. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=117.0s)]
*  You're going to get some black power? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=118.0s)]
*  You're going to get some white power. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=119.0s)]
*  White power. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=120.0s)]
*  Is it you? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=121.0s)]
*  Is it you? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=122.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=123.0s)]
*  Guess where you're going back to. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=124.0s)]
*  Believe it or not, we actually carefully cut that to show you the least vulgar expression [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=125.0s)]
*  we could find from that tape. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=137.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=140.0s)]
*  It still makes you makes your skin crawl. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=141.0s)]
*  I will also just note that when the Nazi groups took to the highway overpasses yesterday, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=144.2s)]
*  one of them right next to the swastika banner, they draped a banner that said, let's go, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=150.48s)]
*  Brandon, except because except because they're exactly the geniuses you think they are. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=155.88s)]
*  They misspelled the word Brandon. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=160.08s)]
*  Like, that's a hard one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Why were they saying, let's go, Brandon? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  If you are unfamiliar, that phrase is a like kind of code among the pro Trump crowd for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=166.48s)]
*  F. Joe Biden. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  It's become a rallying cry for pro Trump folks all over the country and even for Republican [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  elected officials. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=179.16s)]
*  But for whatever reason, this particular group of Nazis feel like that's the right message, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=180.56s)]
*  along with all the kill the Jews stuff. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=185.56s)]
*  And for whatever reason, they believe this is the right moment to go out and gather in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  broad daylight in suburban Orlando, Florida. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=192.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Florida State Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  His district includes the area where this Nazi group gathered on Saturday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=199.0s)]
*  He said yesterday online, quote, hatred and anti-Semitism have no place in our community. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm appalled to see Nazis rallying in the East Orlando district I represent. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  They are never welcome here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=212.0s)]
*  Representative Smith, I appreciate you taking the time to be here tonight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=217.44s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=218.44s)]
*  First, I'm sorry that this happened in your district. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=221.96s)]
*  It is a, at least at least at some level, it is a terrorizing thing for people to come [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=224.6s)]
*  up against this on the street corner, even on the local news on their commute to work [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=231.56s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=235.28s)]
*  Let me just ask how your constituents are reacting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=236.72s)]
*  That's what the community reaction has been. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=239.36s)]
*  Well, folks in the East Orlando based district that I represent near the University of Central [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=242.88s)]
*  Florida were appalled. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=248.6s)]
*  I remember getting tagged and getting texts and getting posts on my social media feed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=250.72s)]
*  that it was happening in Waterford Lakes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=257.92s)]
*  It's a place that I am very familiar with. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  It's near my East Orlando home. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=263.64s)]
*  And folks were really alarmed and scared that this was actually happening in their community. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=267.04s)]
*  And like I said before, in my social media post that you read, this type of hatred and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism is not welcome here in Orlando. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=279.04s)]
*  Orlando is a really diverse community that is an inclusive community, that is an accepting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  community. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=287.68s)]
*  And these neo-Nazis that were rallying around Orlando, they don't represent who we are. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=288.68s)]
*  But it's not just those of us here in Orlando that should be concerned and alarmed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=294.16s)]
*  All Floridians should be concerned because we're seeing a rise of extremism and white [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  supremacy in our state. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  And we all have to understand that that didn't happen here overnight. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=307.6s)]
*  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida is number two in the nation for the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=311.6s)]
*  number of hate groups that are based in our state. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=317.12s)]
*  And that number is growing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=321.76s)]
*  We also know that, unfortunately, there were more Floridians that were arrested and that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=323.6s)]
*  are seeing charges brought against them who were involved in the violent insurrection [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=329.36s)]
*  on January 6th in the nation's capital. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=335.28s)]
*  And many of those individuals were tied to some of these hate groups like the Proud Boys. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  And so it's really incumbent on folks to speak out, to denounce this type of hatred [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  and bigotry, and really just kind of be aware and open their eyes to this rise of extremist [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=349.2s)]
*  and hateful behavior in our area. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  Were any of these groups at all recognizable to you? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=360.08s)]
*  Has there been previous white supremacist activity like this in your district? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=364.64s)]
*  Is there any sense in which these guys were sort of usual suspects for this sort of thing? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=369.68s)]
*  Or was this a surprise? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=373.52s)]
*  And were these strangers? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=375.44s)]
*  Well, we understand that one of the groups that was involved, one of their leaders is [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=380.32s)]
*  based in Kissimmee, which is just around the corner from the East Orlando district that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=385.68s)]
*  I represent. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=390.48s)]
*  We also saw in South Florida some leaflets and some papers, some anti-Semitic documents [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=391.6s)]
*  and flyers that were being left in our communities that were promoting the same hateful message. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=397.92s)]
*  But I think what's important to contextualize here is what are we doing in our state that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  is potentially affecting the rise in hatred and extremism in Florida? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  Our legislature right now is actively considering proposals pushed by Governor DeSantis to, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=421.44s)]
*  for example, shield Floridians from discomfort or guilt by censoring conversations about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=428.0s)]
*  race, about LGBTQ identities in our schools and in our workplaces. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=435.12s)]
*  Somehow, some of these extremists and white supremacists are getting the message that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=441.52s)]
*  it is okay for them to be public with their hatred and anti-Semitism, that they should [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=447.84s)]
*  come out of the shadows because we're seeing this rise in extremism and it's incumbent upon all [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  elected officials, Republican and Democrat, to unequivocally condemn this type of hatred and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  ask why are individuals feeling empowered, these neo-Nazis, to come out from the shadows [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=468.96s)]
*  and why has Florida become such a haven for anti-Semitic extremists and white supremacists? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=477.84s)]
*  Florida State Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=485.2s)]
*  Representative Smith, I appreciate you being here tonight. Again, I am sorry that this has [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=487.84s)]
*  happened in your district. It's a pleasure to have you here to have you able to speak out about it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=491.2s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Thank you, Rachel. And I would also encourage your viewers who want to beat back [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=495.12s)]
*  against this type of hatred and anti-Semitism to donate to the Holocaust Center of Central Florida [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=500.64s)]
*  because we think that education is such an important part of combating this type of hatred. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=506.4s)]
*  Also a good point in that it will absolutely drive crazy those guys who showed up in Orlando today [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=512.72s)]
*  to know that anybody outraged by them isn't just outraged and scared but is actively contributing [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  to a cause like that. Thank you, sir. Much appreciated. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0onbdFVexKk&t=536.4s)]
