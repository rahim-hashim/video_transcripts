# Courts smack down Trump's signature program; Americans instantly outraged over street snatchings
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA)
*  Last night, we showed you this spontaneous big protest that sprung up in Summerville, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=0.0s)]
*  Massachusetts. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=6.44s)]
*  Almost instantly, like 2,000 people gathered near Tufts University the same day that a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=7.44s)]
*  Tufts student was snatched off the street by a half-dozen federal agents who were covering [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=13.16s)]
*  their faces. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=18.84s)]
*  They grabbed her and handcuffed her and stuffed her into an unmarked car. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=19.84s)]
*  As of today, that spot on that Summerville street where she was grabbed by federal agents [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=24.2s)]
*  has become sort of a shrine to her and to what happened there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=28.28s)]
*  The tree there where they grabbed her is now adorned with flowers and ribbons. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=31.8s)]
*  There's a sign on it that says, ICE KIDNAPPED OUR NEIGHBOR. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=35.28s)]
*  We now know that this young woman was moved to an immigration facility, a prison, effectively [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  in Louisiana, despite a judge's order that she was not to be removed from the state of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=45.64s)]
*  Massachusetts without notifying the court. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=50.56s)]
*  She's in Louisiana anyway. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=53.52s)]
*  Today a federal judge ordered that Trump is not allowed to deport this young woman. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=55.48s)]
*  While the judge reviews her case and reviews her arrest, the judge ordering that she, quote, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=60.04s)]
*  shall not be removed from the United States until further order of this court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  We also got confirmation today that this student, her name is Ramesa Ozturk, she was never even [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  notified that her visa had been revoked by the Trump administration. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=74.0s)]
*  Boston Globe reports today the Trump administration revoked the visa of a Tufts graduate student [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  on March 21st, but never notified her before masked immigration and customs enforcement [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=83.96s)]
*  agents swarmed her on a Somerville sidewalk Tuesday and took her into custody. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=90.0s)]
*  Just think about that for a second. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=97.08s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing for them to have revoked this woman's visa. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=98.08s)]
*  I mean, it has its own First Amendment issues, right, among other things, to put it mildly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. government is not supposed to be able to revoke someone's visa because they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=106.52s)]
*  president disagrees with or they went to a protest. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=110.48s)]
*  That is one part of this fight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  But it's one thing to revoke her visa. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=116.72s)]
*  It is another thing to not tell her you have done so, right, because then the first time [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=119.48s)]
*  she finds out that she no longer has a valid visa is when she is physically grabbed on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=125.62s)]
*  the street, thrown into a car, put on a plane, thrown across the country and stuffed into [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=131.12s)]
*  a prison. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=138.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=140.68s)]
*  If you notify somebody that you have revoked their visa, they then have the opportunity [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=143.08s)]
*  not only to, you know, potentially fight it, I guess, but they also have the opportunity [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  to leave the country without being imprisoned, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=153.96s)]
*  But if you just take their visa away and never tell them the way they're doing this, somebody [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=157.52s)]
*  in her situation, the visa holder who's had her visa revoked, she has no way to avoid [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=163.6s)]
*  going to prison. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=167.94s)]
*  There's nothing she can do to avoid being imprisoned. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=168.94s)]
*  Why do it this way? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=174.5s)]
*  This is all going to be litigated. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Rumeza Ozturk's legal team, I should tell you, now includes three lawyers from the ACLU [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  who have joined her case. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=184.22s)]
*  And, you know, it's worth noting that to the extent these immigration cases are getting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=185.22s)]
*  into court, the Trump administration is losing, losing, losing, losing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  Today in New Jersey, people gathered outside the courthouse in Newark in support of Mahmoud [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=193.5s)]
*  Khalil, another grad student the Trump administration is trying to deport after snatching him from, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=197.54s)]
*  I believe, student housing at Columbia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=202.82s)]
*  The courts have so far blocked Khalil's deportation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=205.38s)]
*  His lawyers are asking a federal judge in New Jersey to free him from the prison that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=209.54s)]
*  he is sitting in in Louisiana. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=213.66s)]
*  In Virginia today, a judge did order the release of a Venezuelan couple who were arrested by [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=216.7s)]
*  immigration authorities this month. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=223.06s)]
*  They have legal authorization to live and work in the United States, but they were nevertheless [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=224.98s)]
*  arrested and have been put in prison by the Trump administration. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  The judge in Virginia today called their arrests, quote, baseless and unlawful. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=233.1s)]
*  The couple had already been arrested once and ordered released by a judge. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  Then the Trump administration arrested them again. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  Both times it was in front of the couple's young children. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=246.62s)]
*  In the court hearing today, the judge, quote, rebuked government officials for claiming [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=251.26s)]
*  in court that the couple posed a public threat. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=255.06s)]
*  The judge ordered both of them released straight from the courthouse. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=257.7s)]
*  The judge said to a Trump administration lawyer, quote, there is no reason why they are being [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=262.02s)]
*  held. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=266.78s)]
*  If this was a criminal case, I would throw you out of my chambers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=267.78s)]
*  In a court filing in this case, an assistant director of an ice field office in Washington [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=272.14s)]
*  described the woman in this couple as an affiliate of a gang and later described her as a senior [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=278.38s)]
*  member of a gang. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=285.86s)]
*  The judge practically crumpled up that filing and threw it in the trash, saying, quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=288.46s)]
*  this is a terrible, terrible affidavit. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=293.02s)]
*  Described the claims in the affidavit as, quote, pure hearsay, assumptions, and, quote, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  putting words in people's mouths. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=301.5s)]
*  And did I mention she told the Trump administration lawyer that she was inclined to throw him [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=304.58s)]
*  out of the place? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=311.06s)]
*  Like I said, the Trump administration keeps losing on this stuff in court, including this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=312.06s)]
*  ruling tonight, which says they cannot deport people to some third country where they're [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=318.7s)]
*  not a citizen without due process under law, like, for example, the way they sent hundreds [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=323.02s)]
*  of men to prison in El Salvador without any notice, let alone a hearing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  But as they keep losing all of these cases in court over and over and over again, and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=333.66s)]
*  frankly, probably because they keep losing all of these cases in court, the Trump administration [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=337.98s)]
*  is trying to make it difficult, if not impossible, for lawyers to fight them in court, trying [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  to make it impossible for lawyers to do their jobs, you know, giving people access to the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  remedies afforded by the U.S. Constitution in our judicial system. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=357.02000000000004s)]
*  Because Trump moves to try to intimidate and block the legal profession from doing its [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=362.5s)]
*  role to protect the Constitution and people who are in this country, it has very quickly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=367.34s)]
*  sort of become a do-or-die time for the U.S. legal profession in terms of standing up for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=373.1s)]
*  itself and standing up to his intimidation, a mixed record thus far, but a very, very [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=377.14s)]
*  urgent calling for the legal profession right now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiztDw1C3tA&t=382.94s)]
