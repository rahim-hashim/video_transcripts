# State Democrat stands up to Republican fixation on anti-trans restrictions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU)
*  A strong show of support today for a drag queen story hour event in the district. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=0.0s)]
*  Police keeping a close watch after tense moments at a similar event last week when members [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=4.74s)]
*  of the far right group the Proud Boys showed up in protest. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=9.14s)]
*  News 4's Derek Ward has more on how things went today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=12.84s)]
*  The scene along Barracks Row, the street closure, the crowd, the heavy police presence, it doesn't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=17.52s)]
*  immediately say children's story time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=23.0s)]
*  But neither does this confrontation outside a Silver Spring bookstore last weekend surrounding [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=25.82s)]
*  another children's story time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=30.66s)]
*  As families started to show up for story time, instead of facing a gauntlet of jeers, they [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=32.42s)]
*  were guided by rainbow umbrella wielding escorts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=36.86s)]
*  Still, even the young ones couldn't have been oblivious to all of the police presence. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=40.78s)]
*  In Washington D.C., in Maryland, all across the country now, drag events need police protection [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=46.06s)]
*  and community escorts to shield people from violent screaming crowds of right-wing paramilitary [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=53.66s)]
*  groups who now routinely show up to terrorize people at these events. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=60.06s)]
*  And the stuff that's happening in the streets is sort of mirrored by or dovetailing with [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=64.7s)]
*  a huge surge in legislative attacks on drag performers and the LGBTQ community, basically [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=72.4s)]
*  in every state where Republicans now hold power. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=79.74s)]
*  And Florida, of course, has gotten a lot of attention. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=83.74s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis there has led the passage of multiple new laws targeting gay people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=85.78s)]
*  and trans people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=90.3s)]
*  He's targeted parents with abuse investigations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=91.82s)]
*  Tennessee right now is in the news for a groundbreaking draconian law they're about to enact that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  basically bans drag entirely in that state. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=100.94s)]
*  In Tennessee, performing in drag in public or anywhere where a young person might conceivably [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=105.44s)]
*  see you will be a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=111.72s)]
*  I'm sure Tennessee police will be delighted to have it among their new duties to raid [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=116.44s)]
*  like performances or plays or TikTok shoots or to accost people walking down the street [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=121.36s)]
*  to check that everybody's wearing what the police expect in terms of gender-conforming [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=128.64s)]
*  underwear. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=132.84s)]
*  They're delighted that's going to be among their new responsibilities. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=134.0s)]
*  Tennessee will be so much safer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=137.36s)]
*  And yes, Tennessee may be out in front, but Republicans have introduced bills targeting [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=140.6s)]
*  drag in over a dozen states. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=145.68s)]
*  And that's just the drag bills. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=148.32s)]
*  Republicans have introduced literally hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills nationwide this year, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=150.32s)]
*  nearly half of them specifically targeting trans people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=156.44s)]
*  Iowa alone currently considering 19 bills, including a drag bill and a don't say gay [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=159.64s)]
*  bill for schools and a bill targeting trans youth. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=167.32s)]
*  In Nebraska, a bill banning doctors and nurses from providing medical care for trans kids [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=174.28s)]
*  is also a top priority for Republican lawmakers. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  And in the Nebraska legislature, Republicans hold nearly twice as many seats as Democrats. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=184.04s)]
*  So it has seemed like that bill would likely become law just as soon as they can get it [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=188.8s)]
*  to a vote. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=194.08s)]
*  It turns out getting that bill to a vote is going to be harder than the Republicans expected. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=195.08s)]
*  I have nothing, nothing but time. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  And I am going to use all of it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=208.8s)]
*  One Democratic state senator in Nebraska is taking radical measures to try to stop her [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=213.2s)]
*  Republican colleagues from passing this bill targeting trans young people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=220.04s)]
*  And so far it's working. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=226.2s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=227.44s)]
*  Work on the floor of the Nebraska legislature is at a standstill largely held up by one senator. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=228.44s)]
*  You cannot stop me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=234.0s)]
*  For the second day in a row, Senator Michaela Kavanaugh, Stonewall. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  I will not stand for legislating hate into our statutes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=240.76s)]
*  It will be very painful for this body. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  And if people are like, is she threatening us? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=252.16s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=254.4s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=255.4s)]
*  Kavanaugh promised to take every single bill to cloture, meaning hours of debate on every [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=256.76s)]
*  single bill that comes to the floor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=261.92s)]
*  Take your names off of that piece of poop. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=263.84s)]
*  LB 574. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=268.12s)]
*  Talk to the speaker. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=269.68s)]
*  Demand good governance. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=270.88s)]
*  Be better. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=272.92s)]
*  Be who the children of Nebraska deserve. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=274.08s)]
*  Nebraska State Senator Michaela Kavanaugh has brought the Nebraska legislature to a halt. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=278.44s)]
*  They have a 90 day legislative session there in day 36. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=284.6s)]
*  She has vowed to use all the time in the legislative session to stop what they're doing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=288.24s)]
*  She has vowed specifically to filibuster every single bill, literally standing on the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=293.84s)]
*  floor and talking, dragging out debate to the maximum number of hours on every single [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=299.4s)]
*  agenda item so that Republicans will relent and rescind that anti-trans bill. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=304.52s)]
*  She's forcing the question, is this what Republicans are going to use their government for? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=312.4s)]
*  Senator Kavanaugh says they can use it for that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=318.44s)]
*  They can use it to try to get that one thing done or the state can govern. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=320.64s)]
*  She says she's going to use everything she can to slow that government to a crawl. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  She told her colleagues, quote, I will burn the session to the ground over this bill. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=331.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Nebraska Senator Michaela Kavanaugh, a Democrat who represents the 6th [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=338.08s)]
*  district in Nebraska, which is in Omaha. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=341.56s)]
*  Senator Kavanaugh, really appreciate you joining us tonight. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=343.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=347.32s)]
*  Let me first just ask you if I got any of that wrong. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=349.0s)]
*  I talked about you a little bit at the beginning of the show and just gave you that intro here. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=352.56s)]
*  You know this much better than I do. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=357.04s)]
*  I just want to give you a chance to get me straight here if I got any of that the wrong [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=358.72s)]
*  way around. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=362.96s)]
*  No, I think you have it right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=363.96s)]
*  I think that was pretty accurate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=365.88s)]
*  And I'm standing by that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=367.8s)]
*  I intend to talk a lot. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=369.56s)]
*  Well, tell me how this works in practical terms. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=371.88s)]
*  I know that it's a 90-day session. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=375.48s)]
*  I think we're in like day 36. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=377.64s)]
*  And with the way the filibuster rules work, you can effectively spend hours, you can use [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=380.0s)]
*  up hours of the legislative clock and calendar for anything without anything coming up to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=387.0s)]
*  a vote. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=393.14s)]
*  Through this tactic, by using this tactic, what do you think you could logistically accomplish [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=394.28s)]
*  in terms of stopping legislation, stopping the legislature from governing? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, by my back of the envelope math, we have approximately 518 maximum hours left [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  of debate this session. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=411.48s)]
*  And that means that we could pass potentially no more than 42 bills. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's not very many for the entire legislative session. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=419.54s)]
*  And this is a long session. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=423.12s)]
*  And that means we have to pass a budget. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=424.48s)]
*  So I'm just going to practically make sure that my colleagues have to make a choice about [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=427.12s)]
*  what it is they want to do, what our job is, and is our job to legislate hate, or is our [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=434.32s)]
*  job to govern and work on tax cuts and work on the economy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=439.68s)]
*  So I'm forcing their hand. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=447.72s)]
*  And you're calling the question as to what they are doing and what they do want to spend [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=450.0s)]
*  legislative hours and their capabilities on. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=453.56s)]
*  You're forcing them to choose this or everything else. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=457.04s)]
*  Let me ask what this strategy entails from you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=460.4s)]
*  I know you spent Thursday and Friday talking for hours on the floor. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  I understand part of that time you were fighting a cold and a sore throat. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=469.36s)]
*  I mean, presumably this is physically kind of a big ask just for yourself being able [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  to do this as a human. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, it turns out I had strep throat. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  Which I didn't know. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=483.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was a fun. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=484.44s)]
*  So apparently I can literally filibuster through a virus that attacks your vocal cords. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=486.56s)]
*  And that I'm proving I'm willing to do. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=493.04s)]
*  I'm willing to do whatever it takes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=495.6s)]
*  This is too important. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=498.08s)]
*  I think it's important for us to focus on what it is we're responsible to do as state [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=500.6s)]
*  legislators, as legislators across the country. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=505.8s)]
*  What is our job? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=509.32s)]
*  Our job is public policy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=510.6s)]
*  Our job is not to legislate hate. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=512.32s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is going to hurt children. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=515.36s)]
*  And I don't care how sick I get. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=519.6s)]
*  I don't care how tired I am. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=522.2800000000001s)]
*  I am not going to look back on this moment in time and say I didn't do everything that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=524.2800000000001s)]
*  I possibly could to fight for and protect children, especially our most vulnerable children, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=529.36s)]
*  which are trans youth. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=534.7600000000001s)]
*  Your clarity speaking to me right now and your clarity on the Senate floor, on the floor [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=537.96s)]
*  of the legislature and your clarity in explaining this point is pretty unimpeachable. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=543.92s)]
*  I mean, you're not beating around the bush at all. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=548.16s)]
*  I've been writing down all the quotes that I've seen from you from the floor speeches. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=550.72s)]
*  I want to annoy you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=555.92s)]
*  I want you to genuinely be frustrated to all get out with me. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=557.12s)]
*  This is how the session is going to be for every bill. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=562.4s)]
*  You cannot stop me. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=564.64s)]
*  Take your names off that piece of poop. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=566.48s)]
*  LB 574. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=568.44s)]
*  You've got a gasp out of the room when you said that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=569.44s)]
*  If you want to inflict pain upon children, I'm going to inflict pain on this body. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=571.72s)]
*  I will burn the session to the ground over this bill. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=575.6s)]
*  I mean, you are being very blunt about this. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  I have to ask if it has had either backlash that you didn't expect in terms of people [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=580.36s)]
*  not wanting this and not expecting this from you, or if it's had a galvanizing effect in [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=586.16s)]
*  terms of people who feel the same way that you do about this. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=590.12s)]
*  I think that it has had more of a galvanizing effect than it has backlash. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=594.48s)]
*  I think that we have become so complacent in what we anticipate and expect of our governors [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=599.72s)]
*  that we feel that those that are in positions of power are just not willing to stand up. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=606.48s)]
*  And so the fact that I, and I'm not alone, I have some wonderful colleagues who are standing [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=611.2s)]
*  with me. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that myself and my colleagues are standing up and pushing back so loudly [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=617.24s)]
*  and clearly against this, I do think it's a galvanizing effect. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=621.76s)]
*  I hope it continues to have a galvanizing effect. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=625.64s)]
*  I hope that it gives people hope. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=629.0799999999999s)]
*  I really want to give people hope. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=632.76s)]
*  I really want our trans youth and really our LGBTQ community across the state and across [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=634.24s)]
*  the country to know that there are people fighting for them and that they should not [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=639.68s)]
*  give up hope because I'm not giving up until I have nothing left to give. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=645.64s)]
*  When your voice is small in number, it really helps for it to be clarion, which you're demonstrating. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=652.08s)]
*  Nebraska State Senator Michaela Kavanaugh, thank you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=657.72s)]
*  Stay in touch with us. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  We'd love to be in touch with your office as this goes forward. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=663.1600000000001s)]
*  I know it's going to be a long road to hoe. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=664.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=666.76s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=668.24s)]
*  I appreciate you highlighting this really important issue. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDa0hsVSNxU&t=669.24s)]
