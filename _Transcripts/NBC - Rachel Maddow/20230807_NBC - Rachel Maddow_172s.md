# Maddow: As states take lead on fake elector probes, Trump's role a likely endpoint
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8)
*  We're also seeing some interesting stuff in the states, even as it relates to the most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=0.0s)]
*  hurly-burly thing in national politics, right, which is the legal problems of the Republican [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  presidential frontrunner. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=9.44s)]
*  We're going to have a little bit more on this coming up later on in the show. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=10.44s)]
*  But even as former President Trump is charged federally for, among other things, allegedly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=13.48s)]
*  overseeing a plot to sneak fake votes into the electoral college count, the local Republicans [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  who signed up to be those fake electors in seven states, they are now facing an array [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=25.84s)]
*  of criminal investigations and in some cases, charges themselves. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  In three states now, we have either overt confirmation or clear indication that the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=35.84s)]
*  fake Republican electors are the subjects of open criminal investigations at the state [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=40.92s)]
*  level. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=46.2s)]
*  That's Arizona, New Mexico and Georgia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=47.2s)]
*  In one other state in Wisconsin, the attorney general there won't say either way whether [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=48.88s)]
*  there's an open criminal investigation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  And still another state in Michigan, all 16 fake Republican electors have been now charged [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=54.52s)]
*  with felonies under state law. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=59.84s)]
*  I mean, depending on how things proceed in all these other states, we're looking at potentially [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  dozens of local Republican activists and minor officials, the Trumpiest of all, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=67.4s)]
*  People who absolutely devoted to Donald Trump, who could be looking at felony criminal charges [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=73.4s)]
*  for their part in the fake electors scheme that the Trump campaign told them to carry out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  There were 84 people who signed up to be fake electors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And just as it's possible to look at Donald Trump as the 1090th defendant to be charged [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=90.8s)]
*  in the January 6th investigation, as ABC News' Jonathan Karl has been saying, I think we [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=97.36s)]
*  We may also end up seeing Trump as the 85th person involved in the fake electors scheme [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=102.8s)]
*  to also face potential criminal liability for having jumped off that particularly ill-advised [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=108.32s)]
*  legal high dive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  Everybody else is going to have to face trial for this stuff, but he's not? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=116.92s)]
*  I mean, the way these things are being charged at the federal level, it really looks like [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=122.52s)]
*  what's going to happen on the fake electors thing in terms of criminal charges is going [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=127.64s)]
*  to happen in the individual states where Republicans tried to steal the vote this way. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=131.76s)]
*  There are open pending law enforcement decisions on this now in Wisconsin, in Arizona, in New [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=135.2s)]
*  Mexico, in Georgia, which means that part of the overthrow the election criminal liability [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=141.04s)]
*  saga is really worth watching, not just at the federal level, but in those individual states. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pYXXNFwS8&t=146.8s)]
