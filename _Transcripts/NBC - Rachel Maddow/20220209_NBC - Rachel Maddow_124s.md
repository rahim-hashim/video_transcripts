# Iran Timeline To Nuclear Weapon 'Frighteningly Short' After Failed Trump Policy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc)
*  Let me ask you about the briefing you got on Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=0.0s)]
*  When the United States pulled out of the Iran deal in 2016, it was a fledgling deal, but [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=3.64s)]
*  it had taken a decade to get there, and everybody was at least talking to one another. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=8.24s)]
*  Now we have a situation where the Iranians have hardened, our neighbors in the region, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=12.8s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia have hardened, the U.S. hasn't hardened, the U.S. under Biden [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=17.8s)]
*  would like to get back to this deal, but it's going to be much harder to do. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=21.92s)]
*  You talked about that today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=26.26s)]
*  I did, and I walked out of that briefing really concerned. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=29.28s)]
*  The amount of time right now that it would take Iran to get a nuclear weapon after they [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=35.64s)]
*  made the decision to do so is frighteningly short, much shorter than the timeline before [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=39.84s)]
*  the nuclear agreement was signed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=45.8s)]
*  And we essentially tested the theory of the opponents of the Iran deal, because Donald [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump withdrew from it, he levied unilateral sanctions against Iran, he demanded that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  they come to the table on all of their malevolent behavior. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=59.92s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Everything got worse. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=65.16s)]
*  Iran's support for proxies in the Middle East increased, Iran restarted its dormant nuclear [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=66.16s)]
*  research program, it got much closer to a nuclear weapon, they started shooting at American [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  troops. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=75.64s)]
*  We tried escalation, and it was a disaster. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=76.64s)]
*  Diplomacy is the only path forward to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=79.16s)]
*  And interestingly, although Israel remains opposed to the deal, our Gulf allies, who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  were opposed to it back in 2015, now support it, because they do not want a nuclear arms [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  race in the Middle East. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=94.19999999999999s)]
*  We'll have to talk about this again, because it's an important issue that's sort of getting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  sidelined. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=98.6s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, good to see you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=99.6s)]
*  Chris Murphy is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KzCEWxtmuc&t=103.03999999999999s)]
