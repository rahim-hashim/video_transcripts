# U.S. Women's Soccer Players Score Major Win In Fight For Equal Pay
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE)
*  Equal pay, equal pay, equal pay, equal pay, equal pay. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=0.0s)]
*  Equal pay, equal pay. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=5.0s)]
*  That was, of course, the World Cup crowd chanting equal pay [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=8.52s)]
*  after the US women's national soccer team scored [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=12.08s)]
*  their fourth world title in France. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=14.44s)]
*  Now, if you've been a fan of this show, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=16.96s)]
*  you know that TRMS has been covering [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=18.46s)]
*  the team's long six-year fight for equal pay [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=20.44s)]
*  for several years now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=24.04s)]
*  But that fight reached a tipping point [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=25.44s)]
*  on International Women's Day in 2019, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=27.32s)]
*  when 28 players filed a gender discrimination [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=30.48s)]
*  and equal pay lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=33.92s)]
*  in the lead up to the World Cup. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=37.38s)]
*  They argued, quote, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  despite the fact that these female and male players [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=40.04s)]
*  are called upon to perform the same job responsibilities, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  the female players have been consistently paid less money [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=46.84s)]
*  than their male counterparts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=49.8s)]
*  This is true, even though their performance [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=51.58s)]
*  has been superior to that of the male players, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=55.0s)]
*  with the female players, in contrast to male players, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=57.96s)]
*  becoming world champions, end quote. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=60.38s)]
*  It was that lawsuit, that battle for equality, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=64.94s)]
*  that was hanging over the sidelines [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=67.4s)]
*  as the women's soccer team took home [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=68.88s)]
*  their fourth World Cup championship title. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=70.7s)]
*  And two days after that world captivating win, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=73.88s)]
*  the team leader, Megan Rapinoe, joined Rachel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=76.4s)]
*  The conversation is not about equal pay anymore. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=80.92s)]
*  Everybody, it's like, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=83.84s)]
*  if you're not down with equal pay at this point, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=85.04s)]
*  or equality, or whatever it is, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=87.08s)]
*  you're so far out of reality in the conversation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=88.84s)]
*  that we can't even go there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=93.76s)]
*  I think it's time to move to the next phase. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=95.2s)]
*  Well, today they finally moved to the next phase [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=98.92s)]
*  and they won their hard fought six year battle. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=100.8s)]
*  The players reached a $24 million settlement [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=103.6s)]
*  with the US Soccer Federation [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=106.72s)]
*  to settle that equal pay lawsuit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=108.28s)]
*  The New York Times points that, quote, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=110.48s)]
*  perhaps more notable is US Soccer's pledge [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=112.16s)]
*  to equalize pay between the men's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=115.08s)]
*  and women's national teams in all competitions, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=116.96s)]
*  including the World Cup. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=120.2s)]
*  That gap was once seen as an unbridgeable divide [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  preventing any sort of equal pay settlement. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=125.88s)]
*  If it is closed by the Federation negotiations [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=128.34s)]
*  with both teams, the change could funnel millions of dollars [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=131.32s)]
*  to a new generation of women's national team players, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=134.7s)]
*  end quote. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  Now the settlement falls short of the $66 million [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=139.92s)]
*  that the athletes were initially seeking in back pay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  This settlement is still a victory [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  for the women's national soccer team [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=147.32s)]
*  and for the fans of the team nationwide. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p672M6xJjKE&t=149.16s)]
