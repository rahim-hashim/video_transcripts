Video Description: Jaqueline Alemany, congressional correspondent for the Washington Post, talks about the vivid narrative of January 6th told in text messages to Mark Meadows from Donald Trump's inner circle, including a collection of Fox News hosts, and the likelihood that the January 6th Committee has even more explosive evidence that it is withholding from the media until its final public presentation.

# Frantic January 6 Texts To Mark Meadows Only A 'Sliver' Of Investigation's Evidence
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms)
*  Today, The Washington Post published a feature on just one strand of that evidence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=0.0s)]
*  The thousands of text messages the January 6 investigation has obtained from key players [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=6.42s)]
*  around Trump on January 6 and in the days and weeks leading up to it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=11.42s)]
*  Quote, thousands of frantic, ephemeral text messages that might have otherwise been lost [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=16.04s)]
*  to history are now key to piercing together the most vivid and comprehensive picture to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=21.02s)]
*  date of the events surrounding the chaos at the Capitol. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=26.26s)]
*  Texts that go all the way back to the day after the election, like this one to Trump's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  chief of staff from former Trump energy secretary Rick Perry, previewing, Rick Perry previewing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=35.44s)]
*  what would become one of the attempted strategies to overturn the election. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=42.08s)]
*  Quote, here's an aggressive strategy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=46.1s)]
*  Why can't the states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and other Republican controlled [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  state houses declare this as BS and just send their own electors to vote and have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=54.06s)]
*  it go to the Supreme Court? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  Okay now Rick Perry. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  And this is one to Trump's chief of staff from an unidentified member of the far right [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=63.14s)]
*  House Freedom Caucus just a few days before January 6. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=66.78s)]
*  Quote, if POTUS allows this to occur, we're driving a stake in the heart of the federal [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=70.54s)]
*  republic. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=77.34s)]
*  And texts like those are just the beginning. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  The Post reports, quote, the committee so far has publicly revealed only a sliver of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=83.54s)]
*  the thousands of text messages it has received so far. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is the lead author on that piece, Washington Post congressional correspondent [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=94.54s)]
*  Jacqueline Alamany. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  And as of today, she is also now an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Jackie, thank you for being here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=105.18s)]
*  Congratulations on coming to the family. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about these text messages. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  So you note in your reporting today that the committee has only revealed a sliver of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=112.3s)]
*  thousands of text messages. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=117.14s)]
*  How many of those text messages do you believe were provided by former chief of staff Mark [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=119.06s)]
*  Meadows? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Alex, that's a good question. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  Mark Meadows has certainly provided the majority of the text messages that the committee has [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=127.62s)]
*  received so far. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=133.34s)]
*  We believe that number is upwards of 7,000, but Meadows himself provided 4,000 personal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=135.06s)]
*  text messages, most of which were actually not reviewed by the former president's legal team [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=140.14s)]
*  since they were retrieved from a personal device. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=145.78s)]
*  Meadows' text messages are really viewed by the select committee investigating the January 6 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=149.14s)]
*  insurrection as sort of the connective tissue that is really pulling all of the disparate threads [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=154.38s)]
*  about the planning leading up to and on January 6 altogether. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=159.9s)]
*  These text messages, especially throughout the course of our reporting that we pulled together, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=164.62s)]
*  every text that the committee has so far publicly released is really helping to paint a more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=169.46s)]
*  vivid picture of what happened, especially since there's been such a chasm between public [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=174.66s)]
*  statements made by GOP lawmakers and Fox News hosts versus the concern and the panic that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=179.22s)]
*  was communicated and put directly into Mark Meadows' inbox. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=185.38s)]
*  Yeah, the releases of these tranches of correspondence, it's like a serialized drama. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=189.94s)]
*  How is the committee deciding which texts to release publicly and when to release them? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=196.82s)]
*  I mean, do we have a sense that they're holding onto texts that may be even more explosive in terms of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=201.54s)]
*  public consumption? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=209.5s)]
*  I think the committee is trying to ensure that they have the most blockbuster public hearings possible, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=210.42s)]
*  and that means holding back some of these text messages. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  That being said, the trail of breadcrumbs they've left so far in releasing some of Meadows' text [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=220.18s)]
*  messages with people like Jim Jordan, Sean Hannity, and as we reported this morning, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=227.1s)]
*  Project Veritas president and founder James O'Keefe have been fairly juicy and they have needed to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=235.3s)]
*  release those in order to make a persuasive argument to hold Mark Meadows in contempt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=242.74s)]
*  A lot of those messages were released in the contempt report that the committee put out a few months ago. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=247.26s)]
*  We're still waiting on whether or not the DOJ is going to ultimately take up that contempt referral. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  But there is a fine line there sort of straddling to apply public pressure to get people like Sean [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=261.34s)]
*  Hannity to cooperate voluntarily with the committee versus holding back some of these messages and trying [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  to make the splashiest public presentations possible to draw the American public in. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=274.3s)]
*  Well, and yet some of the things we have are splashy and explosive and drawing the American public in. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=278.62s)]
*  I mean, the text message sent to Mark Meadows by Rick Perry a day after the election, which is essentially [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=283.5s)]
*  like a pitch strategy, aggressive, an aggressive strategy in typical Perry fashion is misspelled, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=289.82s)]
*  But the strategy lays out in Texas, hey, have state legislatures and Republican controlled states send their own electors? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  That's basically the plan as it was laid out and executed. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=302.86s)]
*  Right. And yesterday we find out that the committee's issued subpoenas to two members of the Trump campaign who it says had a role in directing that scheme. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=306.94s)]
*  I guess I wonder whether you think the committee is ahead of the public, the public reporting we have on that aspect of the campaign that effectively they know a lot more about what's transpired than than we've digested in the press as yet. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=315.14s)]
*  I think they do. I think not to toot our own horns. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  We've done a good job of getting out ahead. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=333.26s)]
*  A lot of these stories before the committee was previously aware of them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=335.42s)]
*  But when it comes to the information that they've gathered so far, the volume of these text messages, documents and records and depositions that they've collected makes it such that there's inevitably going to be some some news and some big reveals. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=339.14s)]
*  I think what's also important to note about these texts other than the content and some of these crazier and unexpected reactions to things, these frantic, ephemeral concerns that were raised that would have otherwise been lost to history if not for being memorialized in a text message is the forensic analysis that I believe committee investigators can do of the social networking. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=353.38s)]
*  Obviously, these text messages show the direct pipeline between the White House and Fox News. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=379.06s)]
*  They also show some of the relationships that were more personal than potentially we realized, for example, like the fact that Mark Meadows had a texting relationship with James O'Keefe. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=384.46s)]
*  So that is also helping piece together a lot of these various schemes that were sort of all concurrently going on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=394.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's the first kind of beginning of a fully fleshed out org chart of the Trump universe and the power grid, if you will. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=402.14s)]
*  I got asked about the news today that the Biden White House is effectively clearing the committee to get access to the Trump White House visitor logs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=408.38s)]
*  What could be in those that might not be in the text and other communications that we've been privy to thus far? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=417.46s)]
*  Yeah, that is a very good question. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=426.38s)]
*  And it's actually, you know, I'm not all that certain that we're going to get that much from these logs just yet, because as our reporting has borne out in the last few weeks, we know that this was a president who subverted, ignored and failed to follow most procedures. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=428.38s)]
*  It's unclear if these White House visitors logs were meticulously and accurately kept or if the president was sort of, again, sort of sneaking past these processes that were implemented for a reason to document [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=443.18s)]
*  and keep the most comprehensive picture of history in order for the American public to look back and be able to potentially know who was visiting with the president at this crucial juncture in our democracy. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=457.3s)]
*  But it's unclear if Trump was doing that on the other side of the coin here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=469.3s)]
*  Any names that are on there of people going in and out of the White House that we don't already know of will be extremely helpful. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=475.42s)]
*  We know in those final weeks that the president was trying to overturn the results of the election, there were fringe figures like Michael Flynn, Mike Lindell, Sidney Powell going in and out of the Oval and the White House residents. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=481.46s)]
*  And I think that at this point, any documents that the committee can get their hands on is a win. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if the president was flushing records down the White House toilet, goodness knows what's happened to those visitor logs. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=499.58s)]
*  But we await the reporting on all of it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=504.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure your byline will be on some important stories in the very near future. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  Jackie Alamany, Washington Post congressional correspondent and now an MSNBC contributor. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=511.26s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfhjxwM9sms&t=515.66s)]
