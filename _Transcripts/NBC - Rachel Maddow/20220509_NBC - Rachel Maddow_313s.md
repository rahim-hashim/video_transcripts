# GOP Fields Candidates Of Questionable Character As Attacks On Abortion Rights Intensify
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA)
*  See if you can spot the theme here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to start in Missouri, the field running to be the Republican candidate for [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=2.4s)]
*  U.S. Senator in Missouri. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=6.84s)]
*  It includes the state's disgraced former governor, Eric Greitens. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=8.52s)]
*  Now the reason Republican Eric Greitens is the former governor of Missouri is because [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  he was forced to resign amid multiple scandals, including allegations that he forced a woman [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=17.36s)]
*  into a non-consensual sexual encounter, photographed it, and then blackmailed her about it with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=23.72s)]
*  the photos. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=30.36s)]
*  That's why he was forced out of the governorship in Missouri. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=32.12s)]
*  He has since decided that he's over it, the people of Missouri should be too, and so he's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=35.0s)]
*  jumped into the U.S. Senate race in that state as well. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  Since jumping into the Senate race, Mr. Greitens has faced brand new allegations from his ex-wife. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=42.4s)]
*  She says that he physically abused both her and their children. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=47.16s)]
*  Wow, things like this keep coming up with this guy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=52.28s)]
*  Nevertheless, an internal poll the Greitens campaign shared with reporters today purportedly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=55.52s)]
*  shows him leading the Republican primary field for Missouri Senate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=60.24s)]
*  If you believe their poll, that guy with that record is the leading candidate to be the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=65.0s)]
*  Republican nominee for the United States Senate from Missouri. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  That's Missouri. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=72.6s)]
*  How about Georgia? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=73.6s)]
*  The leading Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Georgia is this guy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=75.04s)]
*  His name is Herschel Walker. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=79.84s)]
*  Mr. Walker's ex-wife accused him of physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=81.48s)]
*  during their marriage, including holding a pistol to her head and threatening to, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  blow her brains out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=91.2s)]
*  According to documents obtained by the AP several years after their divorce, Herschel [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=93.2s)]
*  Walker's ex-wife secured a protective order against him after he repeatedly called her [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=97.36s)]
*  sister and her father threatening again that he was going to kill her. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=101.84s)]
*  So that's the Republican Party's leading candidate for Senate in the great state of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=107.5s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=111.66s)]
*  How about in the great state of Pennsylvania? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=112.98s)]
*  Well, not only is there leading Republican candidate for governor, a guy who was literally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=114.7s)]
*  part of the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, but the guy he endorsed for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=119.3s)]
*  lieutenant governor has just been ordered by a judge to stay away from his own home [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=124.14s)]
*  after his wife obtained a protective order over claims of physical and mental abuse. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=128.58s)]
*  She accuses him of stalking her at work and screaming at her, grabbing her by the shirt [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=133.78s)]
*  and threatening to kill the family dog. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=138.02s)]
*  Okay, Pennsylvania Republicans. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=141.22s)]
*  How about Ohio? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=145.5s)]
*  Republican voters in Ohio's 9th congressional district have been getting a lot of attention [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=147.18s)]
*  over the last few days because they just handed the Republican nomination for one congressional [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=150.54s)]
*  seat to another guy who was at the January 6th riot. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=155.58s)]
*  But in the 7th congressional district, a former Donald Trump staffer won that Republican [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=160.4s)]
*  primary a few days ago as well, even after he was publicly accused of assault by his [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=164.88s)]
*  ex-girlfriend. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=170.3s)]
*  And in his case, the ex-girlfriend making the allegations of physical assault was the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=171.3s)]
*  Trump White House press secretary. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  A senior member of the Trump White House says he physically abused her. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=178.16s)]
*  Doesn't seem to matter. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=183.88s)]
*  Trump endorsed him. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=185.5s)]
*  He won his primary with 70% of the vote. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=186.5s)]
*  And I know this almost sounds like I'm being hyperbolic or I'm rounding up to the next [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=189.72s)]
*  worst thing when you line all these guys up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=195.12s)]
*  But honestly, that's just all the facts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=198.12s)]
*  We haven't even gotten to this headline out of Indiana this weekend. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=201.92s)]
*  Not exaggerating. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=204.42s)]
*  This is a real headline. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=205.42s)]
*  Quote, man accused of killing his wife wins Republican primary from jail. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=206.42s)]
*  Dude is in jail on charges of murdering his wife and he won his Republican primary for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  a municipal board in Indiana. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=220.0s)]
*  He will be on the ballot in November unless he is convicted by then of murdering his wife. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=223.24s)]
*  But being in jail on those charges wasn't a problem. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=230.36s)]
*  If the Republican Party was a private company, their HR department would be blowing through [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  all their overtime just this week. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=238.5s)]
*  And you know, things like this happen from time to time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=242.26s)]
*  You definitely get people accused of doing horrible things who nevertheless end up rising [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  in politics, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=249.14s)]
*  But this is an unusually dense concentration of them for this cycle for the Republican [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=256.02s)]
*  Like how many of these do we need before we start calling it this year's pattern? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=257.02s)]
*  And it is absolutely stunning that the Republican Party is fielding all of these men accused [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=261.56s)]
*  of all of these horrible things involving women, that that is happening in such an [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=266.08s)]
*  incredible concentration while the Republican Party this year is set to be running in the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=269.28s)]
*  context of banning abortion, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  In the wake of the leaked draft Supreme Court majority ruling overturning Roe versus Wade, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=277.12s)]
*  the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said this weekend that it's possible Republicans [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  will pursue a federal nationwide abortion ban if the Republicans are lucky enough to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=286.64s)]
*  take over Congress. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8AH_AbyMUA&t=291.44s)]
