# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Sept. 11
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38)
*  It's called the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a very forgettable name, sorry. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=3.2s)]
*  But it does something very simple. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=5.72s)]
*  They look at political maps from around the country, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=7.32s)]
*  district lines for Congress and state legislatures. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=9.56s)]
*  They look at the maps for how well the maps create [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  competitive elections, whether they give one side [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=15.4s)]
*  an unfair advantage over the other side. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=18.04s)]
*  They look at the maps for fairness, basically, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=20.16s)]
*  and then they give them a letter grade [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=22.16s)]
*  like the grades you get in school. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=23.48s)]
*  Well, in the great state of Wisconsin, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=25.36s)]
*  where the districts were drawn [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=27.16s)]
*  by the Republican legislature, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=28.4s)]
*  the state House maps get an F. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  Same for the Wisconsin State Senate maps. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=34.08s)]
*  Those also get an F for failure. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=35.8s)]
*  The failure for Wisconsin democracy in those maps [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=39.68s)]
*  translates into a win for Wisconsin Republicans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=44.16s)]
*  The bottom line with those maps is that even when [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=46.68s)]
*  way more people in Wisconsin vote for Democrats, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=49.04s)]
*  Republicans win most of the seats anyway. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=51.8s)]
*  It's a nice trick. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=54.32s)]
*  Wisconsin voters appear to be just about fed up [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=56.04s)]
*  with this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Consider what happened this year when they voted [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=59.28s)]
*  for a new state Supreme Court justice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=61.36s)]
*  Liberal candidate Janet Protasewicz told voters [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=63.96s)]
*  the Wisconsin maps are wrong. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=67.48s)]
*  She called the maps rigged. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=69.52s)]
*  She said, they do not reflect people in this state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=70.88s)]
*  Voters heard that message and they picked [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=74.28s)]
*  Janet Protasewicz by a margin of 11 points, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=76.44s)]
*  a resounding margin. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=80.12s)]
*  Her victory created a liberal majority [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=82.44s)]
*  on the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=84.56s)]
*  in 15 years with just a huge win. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=87.44s)]
*  And so Wisconsin Republicans freaked out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=92.2s)]
*  Before she hears a single case on the Supreme Court, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=94.6s)]
*  Republicans are threatening to impeach her. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=97.56s)]
*  They would need a majority vote in the House [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=100.64s)]
*  to impeach her, they have that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=102.6s)]
*  They would need a two thirds majority in the Senate [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=104.24s)]
*  to remove her, a two thirds majority, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=106.88s)]
*  which they also have. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=110.0s)]
*  Wisconsin Democrats are now launching a $4 million [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=113.16s)]
*  ad campaign to alert Wisconsin voters, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  a $4 million campaign to alert Wisconsin voters [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=118.92s)]
*  to what the Republicans are doing, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  to what the Republican plan is for this new justice [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  that the voters in the state just elected [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=126.08s)]
*  by such a resounding margin. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=128.16s)]
*  The chair of the state Democratic Party [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=130.12s)]
*  told the national press this week, quote, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=132.12s)]
*  the longer they push this forward, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=133.96s)]
*  the more political price we want to build [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=135.88s)]
*  for Republicans in the legislature [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=138.36s)]
*  and the whole GOP machinery. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=140.2s)]
*  This could become a fireball that eats all of them [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=142.12s)]
*  up through 2024. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=146.52s)]
*  Joining us now is the chair [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=149.6s)]
*  Mr. Wickler, it's nice to see you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=151.68s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=152.88s)]
*  Thanks so much, Rachel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  The thing that I think is, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  even if you don't know anything about Wisconsin politics, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=158.8s)]
*  the thing that I think is shocking from the outside [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=161.12s)]
*  is the size of her victory in that statewide election [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=163.44s)]
*  and then the immediate move to remove her anyway, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=167.4s)]
*  even before she's done anything as a judge. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=170.28s)]
*  How is this being viewed inside the state? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  There's no more fundamental American value [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  than the freedom to choose our own leaders. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  So when Wisconsinites find out [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=181.72s)]
*  that a group of politicians led by Robin Voss, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  the Republican speaker of our state assembly, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  are threatening to overturn the last election [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=188.36s)]
*  just to lock in their own power and prevent the public [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=191.32s)]
*  from choosing who leads the state, they are outraged. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=194.4s)]
*  We've been flooded with calls. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  People are donating left and right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=199.44s)]
*  And more critically, they're calling Republicans [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  in the state legislature to tell them not to do this, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=204.28s)]
*  not to cross this line and throw out a race, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  a million votes that took place just a few months ago. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=210.32s)]
*  It is shocking. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=213.72s)]
*  And this is a moment when everyone needs to weigh in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=215.32s)]
*  to stop the GOP from essentially undermining [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=218.56s)]
*  the entire system of democracy in our state [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=221.72s)]
*  and creating a precedent that could spread across the country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=224.32s)]
*  As I mentioned, Ben, the Republicans do, on paper, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=228.56s)]
*  have the votes to do this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  They certainly have a majority in the House [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=233.56s)]
*  and they have two-thirds in the Senate, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=235.44s)]
*  basically exactly as far as I understand it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  What that means is they have the votes to do it, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  but with zero margin. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=242.4s)]
*  It means if there are any defectors from this plan, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=243.52s)]
*  it won't work. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=246.12s)]
*  Are any Republicans visibly getting a little nervous [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=247.12s)]
*  or wobbly about this? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=250.0s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  So now that the public is finding out about this plot, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=253.24s)]
*  at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  we set up a website at DefendJustice.com [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=257.92s)]
*  with a scorecard. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=261.6s)]
*  And if you go there, you'll see that we have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=262.88s)]
*  our first Republican state representative [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=264.6s)]
*  who came out publicly and said, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=266.92s)]
*  "'No, he would vote against impeachment.'" [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=268.88s)]
*  We have a few that have told constituents [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=271.4s)]
*  that they're against, although they haven't said so publicly. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=273.52s)]
*  And then we have a whole bunch that are saying nothing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=276.24s)]
*  about their position. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=279.12s)]
*  Our sense is that they realize [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=280.28s)]
*  that this is a total political disaster for them, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=282.24s)]
*  that even if they successfully impeached [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=285.48s)]
*  a Supreme Court justice to lock in their power, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=287.88s)]
*  which has never happened before in Wisconsin [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=289.88s)]
*  or anywhere else, there's never been [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=292.36s)]
*  a purely political impeachment. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=293.96s)]
*  Even if they did that, voters would eventually [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=296.32s)]
*  have the final say. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=298.52s)]
*  So they need to step back from this brink. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=299.92s)]
*  And frankly, what they're proposing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=302.56s)]
*  is against the Wisconsin Constitution. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=304.6s)]
*  So they have a pretty good exit ramp. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=306.92s)]
*  They can just say, they looked at it, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=309.2s)]
*  it doesn't meet the standard that the Constitution [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=311.12s)]
*  sets out, they're done. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=313.12s)]
*  If they don't do that, they're going to have to answer [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  to voters for the rest of their political lives. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=316.8s)]
*  Ben Wickler, Chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=319.96s)]
*  Ben, I know this is a very hard fought fight [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=322.52s)]
*  in your state right now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=325.48s)]
*  Thanks for keeping us apprised, I appreciate it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=326.32s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=329.04s)]
*  Whether or not you remember this exact broad daylight [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=331.2s)]

*  Ronan, thank you very much for making time to be here tonight. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=761.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=762.72s)]
*  First, let me just ask you [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=764.9200000000001s)]
*  if I have characterized your reporting correctly. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=765.96s)]
*  I know that both you and Mr. Isaacson [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=769.08s)]
*  and reporter for The Economist and some other people [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=771.64s)]
*  have gotten to different pieces of this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=774.12s)]
*  So what I see is sort of this same story. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=776.72s)]
*  Did I characterize your reporting accurately [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=778.84s)]
*  and did you see it sort of the way I presented it? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=780.68s)]
*  You did, and I always respect how you give viewers [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=783.56s)]
*  the timeline of everyone who contributed [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=787.04s)]
*  to our understanding. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=788.76s)]
*  I'd also point out the Financial Times, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=789.84s)]
*  as this was happening, was doing good leading reporting [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=791.72s)]
*  about the outages in terms of coverage [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=794.4s)]
*  on the Ukrainian front lines. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=796.8s)]
*  I talked to not just the officials you mentioned, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=798.32s)]
*  but also Ukrainian soldiers on the ground [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=800.56s)]
*  who had the experience personally of being shocked [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=803.88s)]
*  as they attempted to advance in some of these critical areas [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=806.76s)]
*  where Russia was attempting to seize control [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=809.96s)]
*  and as they lost the ability for commanders [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  to communicate with troops on the front lines. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  So there are varying opinions about how directly [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=816.72s)]
*  that contributed to, for instance, potential loss of life, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=819.68s)]
*  but everyone around this seems to agree [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=823.16s)]
*  what happened is as you rendered it [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=825.24s)]
*  and that there was a grievous consequence [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  for people on the ground. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=829.92s)]
*  I wanna talk specifically about Mr. Musk's communications [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=832.72s)]
*  with the Russian government. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=836.48s)]
*  As you point out in the New Yorker, and you're right, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=837.68s)]
*  there's nothing illegal about an American private citizen [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=839.24s)]
*  talking to a foreign government that said [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=842.0s)]
*  it's not exactly legal for American private citizens [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=843.84s)]
*  to conduct their own foreign policy [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=846.88s)]
*  contrary to the interests of stated US foreign policy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=848.6s)]
*  But we're sort of in that, within those bounds, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=852.28s)]
*  I think a little bit in trying to figure this out. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=857.92s)]
*  You reported that Mr. Musk has had direct conversations [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  with Russian officials. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=864.0s)]
*  We have seen Mr. Musk post very obviously [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=866.64s)]
*  pro-Russian propaganda after these conversations. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=870.36s)]
*  You connect that communication, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=873.56s)]
*  apparently Mr. Isaacson connects that communication as well, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=875.28s)]
*  in time to Mr. Musk's decision to cut off [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=878.04s)]
*  this crucial communications asset for the Ukrainian military. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=880.92s)]
*  What do you understand about his communication [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=884.28s)]
*  with Russia? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=887.4s)]
*  The timeline is fairly straightforward here, Rachel, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=888.88s)]
*  and we have abundant evidence about it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=891.2s)]
*  Elon Musk very often likes to identify problems in the world [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=893.12s)]
*  and swoop in and try to solve them. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=898.12s)]
*  There's a lot of upside to that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=899.8s)]
*  NASA's reliance on him is also an antidote to a situation [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=901.52s)]
*  where we literally had no way to launch American astronauts [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=905.04s)]
*  into space unless the Russians launched for us. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=907.92s)]
*  So there are positives to this. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=910.48s)]
*  However, what we saw in the Ukraine case [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=912.44s)]
*  was Elon Musk swooped in, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=914.32s)]
*  he was tweeting with Ukrainian officials, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=915.84s)]
*  he was saying, Starlink is on the way. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=917.48s)]
*  Then over the ensuing months, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=919.4s)]
*  I think he clocked the price tag of this, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=921.2s)]
*  so there was a pragmatic concern, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=924.2s)]
*  and there appears to have been an ideological shift [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=926.08s)]
*  where at conferences and in other settings, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=928.32s)]
*  and as you say, even eventually on Twitter, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=930.4s)]
*  he started, for instance, putting out public peace plans [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=932.6s)]
*  that accorded exactly with what the Russians wanted, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=935.96s)]
*  new referendums that might redraw the lines [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=939.12s)]
*  in favor of Russia. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=941.4000000000001s)]
*  He started tweeting out information [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=942.36s)]
*  that the Russians often point to, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=944.3199999999999s)]
*  namely that there are areas around Ukraine's borders [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=946.36s)]
*  in which the local population, they like to say, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=949.4s)]
*  would prefer Russian rule. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=951.76s)]
*  That's something that Elon Musk parroted. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=952.92s)]
*  So we see all of this that's public facing. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  Then we have the fact from multiple people now [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  that he was in many conversations, it appears, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=960.72s)]
*  with Russian officials, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=963.8s)]
*  and at least one with Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=965.24s)]
*  Later, as you pointed out, he denied that, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=967.6s)]
*  but that does seem to be the case. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=970.16s)]
*  And you cited a paragraph [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=971.56s)]
*  for their unnamed officials saying that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=973.28s)]
*  I would point out there's also on the record, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=975.08s)]
*  people saying that Colin Coll, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  senior defense official who's very respected [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=979.48s)]
*  is on the record in this piece, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=981.88s)]
*  talking about the conversation you mentioned [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=983.44s)]
*  in which Elon Musk was watching that map [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=985.6s)]
*  and said, I talked to Vladimir Putin, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=987.92s)]
*  not in another time, as he's later claimed, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=990.28s)]
*  not about an unrelated thing, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=992.12s)]
*  very clearly implying about this in this timeframe. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=993.72s)]
*  Well, the other thing that's so unnerving [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=998.08s)]
*  about that section of your reporting [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1000.4s)]
*  is just the idea of what Mr. Musk describes. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  On the phone, Musk said he was looking at his laptop [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1007.72s)]
*  and could see, quote, the entire war unfolding [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1010.24s)]
*  through a map of Scarlink activity. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1013.5600000000001s)]
*  So if you've got anybody in the world, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1015.64s)]
*  I don't care what nationality you are, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1017.16s)]
*  but if you've got somebody who is saying [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1018.4s)]
*  that he's having direct conversations with Vladimir Putin, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1021.2s)]
*  who is saying, according to lots of good reporting, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1023.88s)]
*  that he is talking to the Russian government regularly [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1026.56s)]
*  and senior officials in the Russian government, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1029.32s)]
*  and he simultaneously has access to information [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1031.3999999999999s)]
*  that shows, in his words, the entire war unfolding [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1034.72s)]
*  in terms of what the Ukrainian government is doing, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1039.04s)]
*  what Ukrainian units are doing all over that active war zone, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1041.3999999999999s)]
*  that's a very, very dangerous [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1045.8s)]
*  potential conduit of information, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1047.6s)]
*  just in terms of the conduct of the war. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1050.56s)]
*  I mean, that's the biggest intelligence risk [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1052.8s)]
*  you could possibly imagine in terms of whether or not [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1054.76s)]
*  Ukraine's ever gonna be able to win this thing. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  Needless to say, Rachel, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1059.28s)]
*  this is of grave concern to Ukrainians, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1060.72s)]
*  to American defense officials watching this conflict [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1063.32s)]
*  and trying to advance American interests in the region. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1066.0s)]
*  You mentioned that regardless of the legal lines, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1068.8799999999999s)]
*  it is a unique phenomenon and potentially a problem [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1071.9199999999998s)]
*  when a private individual [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1074.9199999999998s)]
*  is brokering foreign policy like this. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk does have many of the powers of a state now. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1078.36s)]
*  He goes on diplomatic missions. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1081.08s)]
*  He poses for the kind of awkward, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1082.84s)]
*  smiling, handshake photos with foreign officials, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1084.28s)]
*  including Chinese officials [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1086.48s)]
*  that we usually associate with elected officials. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1088.16s)]
*  And we have American officials treating him [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1090.88s)]
*  like an elected official [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1093.24s)]
*  because his power is unavoidable in these areas. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1094.24s)]
*  And Elon Musk is also a good lens to reach to view [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1096.68s)]
*  the perils of that because there's a lot of good he does, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1099.48s)]
*  there's a lot of ways in which he's smart, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1102.1200000000001s)]
*  but we also see a radical behavior. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1103.6s)]
*  We also see how, as you mentioned, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1105.2s)]
*  in the kind of radicalism he's displayed on Twitter, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1106.84s)]
*  he does have a tendency to absorb and carry water [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1109.48s)]
*  for new views that he didn't espouse previously, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1112.16s)]
*  very rapidly. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1115.8799999999999s)]
*  And in this case, he's also an individual [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1117.12s)]
*  who is buffeted by headwinds of incentives [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1119.3999999999999s)]
*  around his businesses and where they operate [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  that are not always aligned with American interests. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1124.72s)]
*  So for instance, half of all of Tesla's, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1126.9599999999998s)]
*  the vehicles, are produced in a Shanghai factory. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  That means he has to be [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1132.6s)]
*  in diplomatic conversations with Beijing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1134.24s)]
*  And he's a fairly transparent guy in some ways. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1137.12s)]
*  It's not clear that all of his statements around this [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1141.1599999999999s)]
*  have always been accurate, like the Putin comments. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1143.56s)]
*  However, he talks about it a lot. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1146.1599999999999s)]
*  He goes in interviews with the Financial Times in one case [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1147.84s)]
*  and comes out and says, I've talked to the Chinese. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1150.76s)]
*  They're mad about me giving internet access in Ukraine, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1153.6s)]
*  because remember, the Chinese have backed the Russians [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1156.36s)]
*  in this conflict. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1158.8799999999999s)]
*  And they're fearful of that kind of free internet technology [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1159.9199999999998s)]
*  being given to their own people. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1162.56s)]
*  So he's dealt with blowback for the Ukrainian support [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1163.84s)]
*  because of his unique geopolitical position. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1167.04s)]
*  And that does underscore how dangerous it is [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1170.32s)]
*  to concentrate all of this power [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1172.92s)]
*  in the hands of private billionaires [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1174.96s)]
*  with their own interests. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1176.44s)]
*  Right, and it raises the question [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1178.4s)]
*  if he's being pressured and advised [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1179.8400000000001s)]
*  by the Chinese and the Russians, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1182.1200000000001s)]
*  what's the relationship of the US government to him, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1183.6000000000001s)]
*  particularly when he's conducting effectively foreign policy [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1186.88s)]
*  against the interests of stated US policy? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1190.92s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ronan Farrell. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1195.2s)]
*  Ronan, thank you for this reporting. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1197.0800000000002s)]
*  Thanks for talking with us about it tonight. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1199.16s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1200.52s)]
*  Thanks for all you do, Rachel. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrK3MCFlL38&t=1201.8s)]
