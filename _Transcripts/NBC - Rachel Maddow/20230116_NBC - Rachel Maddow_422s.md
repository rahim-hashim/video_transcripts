# New book shows how journalists exposed frighteningly invasive spyware
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8)
*  What if somebody could target your mobile phone without you having to click on a link [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=0.0s)]
*  or open an attachment or even answer a call? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=8.36s)]
*  What if just by having your phone number, someone who wished you harm could take complete [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=11.92s)]
*  control of your phone from afar? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=17.88s)]
*  Again, without you doing anything wrong and without you knowing that they had control [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=20.12s)]
*  of it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=24.48s)]
*  They could see all of your contacts. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=25.66s)]
*  They could read all of your texts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=27.9s)]
*  They could read all of your emails. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  They could see all of your photos and videos. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=31.66s)]
*  They could see everything in your calendar. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=33.8s)]
*  They could listen in on all of your calls without you knowing they could use the location [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=35.66s)]
*  data in your phone to pinpoint your exact personal location at any time, 24 hours a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=40.3s)]
*  day. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  They could turn on the microphone in your phone to listen in wherever you are. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=46.28s)]
*  They could turn on the camera on your phone to see you and see whatever you're doing, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=51.96s)]
*  again, without you ever knowing that they were doing it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=56.18s)]
*  And again, without you doing anything wrong to make it possible. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=59.14s)]
*  It turns out that kind of technology exists, where somebody without you knowing can access [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=64.34s)]
*  your phone and do all of those things on your phone and see everything that you do on your [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=70.98s)]
*  phone and have done on your phone. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=75.98s)]
*  That technology exists. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=78.08s)]
*  Imagine how dangerous a tool that would be against civil rights activists. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=81.7s)]
*  Imagine how dangerous a tool that would have been against the Martin Luther King-era civil [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=86.3s)]
*  rights movement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=90.62s)]
*  And in fact, this technology, it not only exists, it's not like a concept car, it's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=93.26s)]
*  not like something that hasn't been deployed, it's just been developed in a lab. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=98.14s)]
*  It actually has been used already by repressive governments around the world to target exactly [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=102.14s)]
*  who you think they would target with a tool like that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=107.26s)]
*  This thing is marketed supposedly as a law enforcement tool, an anti-terrorism tool. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=110.76s)]
*  But government officials have used it around the world against their personal enemies, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=115.14s)]
*  their ex-wives, their political rivals. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they've used it against opposition figures and journalists and human rights advocates [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=123.48s)]
*  and civil rights activists and advocates for minority groups. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Whoever it is that that country's thorn in the side, whoever it is that that country's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=132.54000000000002s)]
*  insistent moral beacon, right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=138.58s)]
*  Whoever's making change and leading movements, whoever's angering repressive government [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=141.62s)]
*  officials, that's who's been targeted with this technology. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  There's a book that's coming out tomorrow, which means technically it comes out at midnight [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=150.86s)]
*  tonight. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  And the book is called Pegasus. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  It's written by two journalists, Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=159.3s)]
*  They exposed the existence of this technology and its use by repressive governments around [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=164.14s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  The big break in them exposing it came when they got a list of 50,000 phones that had [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=170.48s)]
*  been selected for targeting with this pernicious software. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=176.22s)]
*  The software is called Pegasus. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  With that list of 50,000 numbers in hand, these journalists launched an international [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=182.61999999999998s)]
*  reporting project to discover what this software was, where it came from, and who it was being [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=188.0s)]
*  used against. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=194.76s)]
*  And as I said, the book, which is called Pegasus, it comes out at midnight tonight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=197.92s)]
*  I wrote the introduction to the book. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=201.96s)]
*  Here's a little piece of it from the audiobook. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=204.96s)]
*  The insidious power of a Pegasus infection was that it was completely invisible to the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=208.8s)]
*  victim. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=213.68s)]
*  You'd have no way to know the baddies were reading your texts and emails and listening [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=214.68s)]
*  in on your calls and even your in-person meetings until they used their ability to track your [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=218.84s)]
*  exact location to send the men with guns to meet you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=224.44s)]
*  For the Pegasus project to succeed in exposing the scale of the scandal, the journalists [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  knew they would need to be able to diagnose an infection or an attempted infection on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=235.32s)]
*  an individual phone. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=240.16s)]
*  Claudio and Donka figured out how to do it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=242.4s)]
*  Working quite literally alone, these two took on a multi-billion dollar corporation that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=245.32s)]
*  employed 550 well-paid cyber specialists, many with the highest levels of military cyber [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  warfare training. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=258.38s)]
*  To best that Goliath, these two Davids had to fashion their own slingshot. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=260.24s)]
*  They had to invent the methods and tools of their forensics on the fly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  That they succeeded in that is as improbable as it is important for all of our sakes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=271.24s)]
*  Here also is the story of the victims of Pegasus. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=279.04s)]
*  Among them are those who hold enough power that you might expect they'd be protected [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=282.42s)]
*  from this kind of totalist intrusion. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=286.72s)]
*  Heads of state, high-ranking royals, senior politicians, law enforcement figures. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=290.24s)]
*  And then there's the people whom governments the world over have always liked to put in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=296.08s)]
*  the crosshairs. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=299.68s)]
*  Opposition figures, dissidents, human rights activists, academics. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=301.56s)]
*  Laurent and Sandrine rack focus tight on the group most represented in the leaked data, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  of course, and that's journalists. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=311.44s)]
*  It's no surprise that Pegasus has been turned full blast on reporters and editors in order [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=314.68s)]
*  to harass, intimidate, and silence. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=320.82s)]
*  If this anti-democratic authoritarian nightmare cannot be safely reported upon, it won't [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=324.48s)]
*  be understood. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=331.04s)]
*  And if it isn't understood, there's no chance that it will be stopped. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=332.04s)]
*  Again, that's from the introduction I did to this book, Pegasus, which comes out tonight [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=336.6s)]
*  at midnight. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  I did not write the whole book. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  I just did the introduction because I think the story is incredible. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  And the story has developed in the United States in really interesting ways. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  in this international reporting project, exposed that this kind of surveillance was happening. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=352.92s)]
*  The U.S. government did an unexpectedly stand-up and strong thing. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=358.88s)]
*  They blacklisted the company that makes Pegasus, and they banned the use of Pegasus software [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=362.16s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=366.92s)]
*  That didn't stop it around the world. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=369.82s)]
*  This is still a live issue, and it's actually still a live issue in the United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=371.12s)]
*  Just last week, the U.S. Supreme Court let the company WhatsApp go ahead and sue the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=374.66s)]
*  company that makes Pegasus. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=380.28s)]
*  WhatsApp gets to sue Pegasus, gets to sue the company that makes Pegasus for using their [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  software to break into people's phones and spy on people's encrypted messages on WhatsApp. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=387.44s)]
*  So that sort of intratech civil lawsuit is going to go ahead, and that could be a big [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=393.08s)]
*  deal. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  This is a live issue. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  This is hotly contested territory. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwgQrlgAb8&t=399.59999999999997s)]
