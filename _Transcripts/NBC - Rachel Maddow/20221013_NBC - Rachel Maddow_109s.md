# 'Oh, Wow!': Brian Sicknick's Brother Reacts To Trump Subpoena By January 6 Committee
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk)
*  Committee Resolution 1 resolved that the chairman be and is hereby directed to subpoena Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=0.0s)]
*  J. Trump for documents and testimony in connection with the January 6th attack on the United [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=7.84s)]
*  States Capitol. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=13.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=14.72s)]
*  When the clerk for the January 6th investigation read out the resolution calling for a subpoena [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=15.72s)]
*  for former President Trump, is it possible that your eye fell on the guy who was sitting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=21.12s)]
*  behind him? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=26.04s)]
*  Look on the right side of your screen and we'll just play it again. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=27.64s)]
*  As the clerk announces the name Donald J. Trump, you can see this gentleman mouth the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=31.0s)]
*  words, oh wow. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=35.28s)]
*  That man's name is Ken Sicknick. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=38.68s)]
*  The reason that name is familiar to you is because Ken Sicknick is the brother of U.S. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=41.2s)]
*  Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who collapsed the night of January 6th after fighting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  off rioters at the Capitol for hours. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=50.72s)]
*  He died the next day. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=52.46s)]
*  After we saw Mr. Sicknick react that way to the subpoena being voiced and voted on [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=54.92s)]
*  in the room, we reached out to Ken Sicknick today to ask what was going through his mind [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  in that moment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=64.0s)]
*  He told us that he was surprised in that moment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=65.84s)]
*  He was pleased. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=68.34s)]
*  He also said he expects nothing will ultimately come of it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=69.66s)]
*  In his words, he told us, quote, I'm not holding my breath. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=72.8s)]
*  He said he believes that after all these public hearings, though, there is no way that anybody [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=76.6s)]
*  can deny Trump is responsible. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=81.1s)]
*  That is why we got from him today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=85.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=86.82s)]
*  In that moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH01UGDr0Pk&t=87.82s)]
