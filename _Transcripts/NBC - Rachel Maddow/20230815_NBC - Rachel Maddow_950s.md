# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 14
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI)
*  All over the country right now, people are wondering what Hillary Rodham Clinton is thinking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=0.0s)]
*  watching things unfold in Georgia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=5.4s)]
*  She is the former Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Senator from New York and Secretary [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=7.96s)]
*  of State. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=11.44s)]
*  I should tell you, she has a new essay out in the Atlantic on the well-being of Americans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=12.44s)]
*  in our democracy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=16.12s)]
*  It's called The Weaponization of Loneliness. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=17.12s)]
*  Madam Secretary, fancy meeting you here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=20.16s)]
*  It's really nice having you here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=21.84s)]
*  Oh, I can't believe this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=22.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=23.84s)]
*  This is not the circumstances in which I expected to be talking to you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=24.84s)]
*  Nor me, Rachel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=28.0s)]
*  It's always good to talk to you, but honestly, I didn't think that it would be under these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=29.6s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=35.68s)]
*  Yet another set of indictments. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=36.68s)]
*  This is something, this is becoming like a skill set. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Like in the news business, you say like, oh, I've covered Olympics or I've covered a campaign. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=42.72s)]
*  Now it's, you know, those of us who've covered four indictments. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if four is it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=49.8s)]
*  We don't know if Donald Trump is among those indicted this evening, but all expectations [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=51.84s)]
*  are that he will be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=55.32s)]
*  Do you feel satisfaction in that? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=59.28s)]
*  You warned the country essentially that he was going to try to end democracy, but most [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=63.96s)]
*  of the country didn't believe you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=68.08s)]
*  Well, it's hard to believe. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=69.56s)]
*  I don't feel any satisfaction. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=71.04s)]
*  I feel great, you know, just great profound sadness that we have a former president who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=72.64s)]
*  has been indicted for so many charges that went right to the heart of whether or not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  our democracy would survive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=88.36s)]
*  And we don't know yet what the charges coming out of Georgia are. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=90.24s)]
*  But if you stop and think about what the public evidence is, and you've been talking about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=93.88s)]
*  some of that for the last hour, he set out to defraud the United States of America and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=98.36s)]
*  the citizens of our nation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=104.72s)]
*  He used tactics of harassment, intimidation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=107.52s)]
*  He made threats. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=112.96s)]
*  He and his allies went after state officials, local officials responsible for conducting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  elections. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=120.32s)]
*  Now we know they even went into voting machines in order to, you know, determine whether or [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  not those voting machines had somehow been breached when they were the ones actually [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=128.16s)]
*  doing the breaching. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=132.84s)]
*  So there is a great deal already in the public record. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll wait to see what the indictments themselves say, because clearly this investigation has [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=138.04s)]
*  been very thorough. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=142.6s)]
*  But I don't know that anybody should be satisfied. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  This is a terrible moment for our country to have a former president accused of these [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=148.48s)]
*  terribly important crimes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=156.12s)]
*  The only satisfaction may be that the system is working, that all of the efforts by Donald [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump, his allies and his enablers to try to silence the truth, to try to undermine [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=166.68s)]
*  democracy have been brought into the light, and justice is being pursued. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=173.12s)]
*  When we were watching Gwen Kies-Fleming and Lawrence speaking just a moment ago about [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=181.84s)]
*  the mandatory minimum prison sentence in Georgia for a RICO conviction, and Ms. Kies-Fleming [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=186.0s)]
*  noted, you know, maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit, and I saw you chuckle. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=191.8s)]
*  Clearly we are getting ahead of ourselves, and we are thinking about potential sanctions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=195.84s)]
*  as a result of any of these trials, let alone, I mean, there's these things getting to trial. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=199.76s)]
*  There's the question of conviction. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=204.8s)]
*  There's the question of sentencing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=205.96s)]
*  But then there is, at the end of that road, the prospect of the prohibitive favorite for [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=207.78s)]
*  the Republican presidential nomination being in prison. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=215.36s)]
*  Do we as a country have an interest in him not going to prison so that we can still call [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=221.16s)]
*  ourselves a country where leading politicians don't get locked up? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=228.16s)]
*  Look, I think that's going to be a much debated issue throughout the country over the next [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=231.72s)]
*  months because holding him accountable can happen in a number of ways. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=239.2s)]
*  Prison obviously is one of them, but there are other approaches that can be taken. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=245.04s)]
*  I think one of the important comments that came out of this long day down in Georgia [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  was by the former lieutenant governor when he said, this is a pivot point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=255.28s)]
*  The Republican party needs to move away. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=259.4s)]
*  Quit being part of a cult, in effect, is what he meant, where you follow someone who lies [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  to you, undermines legitimate processes of government. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=269.4s)]
*  Move away from him politically. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=274.56s)]
*  And trying to get back to politics in the sense that we used to think we had it, despite [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=276.56s)]
*  all the human frailties that accompanied it, where you had parties that would sanction [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=283.2s)]
*  and hold accountable their own members. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=289.68s)]
*  I was on the impeachment inquiry staff. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  You cannot make up my life. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=293.68s)]
*  So back in 1974, when the impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee was voted on, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=295.68s)]
*  four Republicans voted to impeach President Nixon. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=304.32s)]
*  Then three members of the Senate, leading Republican senators, I think it was Barry [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=307.92s)]
*  Goldwater and Howard Baker and I think Hugh Scott, went to see President Nixon and said, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=312.8s)]
*  this was a bipartisan vote. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=320.32s)]
*  You need to resign. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=322.48s)]
*  Well, that's almost impossible to imagine today because of what's happened to the Republican [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=323.6s)]
*  Party, what they've allowed to happen to themselves. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=328.56s)]
*  So I hope that we won't have accountability just for Donald Trump and if there are others [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=332.88s)]
*  named in these indictments along with him for their behavior, but we'll also have accountability [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=339.16s)]
*  for a political party that has just thrown in with all of the lies and the divisiveness [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=345.6s)]
*  and the lack of any conscience about what was being done to the country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=352.12s)]
*  In terms of getting out of this and coming out of this crisis stronger, hopefully, for [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  having confronted, I think, very dark prospects in terms of what this means for democracy, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=366.04s)]
*  it does feel like the Republican Party as a whole is not ready to make that turn. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=371.24s)]
*  And I'm thinking really about Ron DeSantis as the guy who's running second to Donald [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=376.16s)]
*  Trump in the Republican primary right now. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=380.92s)]
*  He is promising that there shouldn't be an independent Department of Justice. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=384.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  He's promising anything to try to get to some attention. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  It's kind of pathetic, isn't it? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=393.72s)]
*  He's also removed two elected prosecutors in Florida who were chosen, who were elected, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  who he stepped in and removed them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  Georgia Republicans have given themselves the power to remove elected prosecutors as [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  well just ahead of Fannie Wallace making this decision. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=408.64s)]
*  That law will go into effect about seven or eight weeks from now, which will give them [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=412.28s)]
*  that opportunity. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=416.2s)]
*  It does feel like the idea of law enforcement being used as a tool of partisan politics [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=417.58s)]
*  is something that, with whatever justification, the Republican Party is really embracing and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  ready to run with or without Trump. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=428.82s)]
*  That feels like a big step in the wrong direction. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=431.56s)]
*  Well, that's yet to be determined, Rachel. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=433.24s)]
*  That is yet to be determined. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=435.34s)]
*  I think it is possible that there are many now in the Republican Party who have signed [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=436.56s)]
*  on to that kind of approach to politics, that undermining of democracy, undermining the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=443.92s)]
*  rule of law. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  But the shadow of Trump looms so large over all of them, it's really hard to know once [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=452.32s)]
*  he's off the scene, one way or the other, politically or because of accountability arising [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=460.36s)]
*  out of the various indictments he faces, whether or not backbone will all of a sudden be regrown, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=466.6s)]
*  whether conscience will once again be part of the Republican Party ethos, we don't know. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  We hope because it would be for the good of the country that that were to happen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=483.18s)]
*  But if it doesn't, the only way we can possibly contest it and defeat it is through the rule [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=488.44s)]
*  of law, as we're seeing with these prosecutors at the federal and now the state level, but [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=495.4s)]
*  also through elections, where we have to defeat those who want to weaponize divisiveness, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  who want to undermine democratic values and institutions. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=508.4s)]
*  And that should be, frankly, nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=512.8s)]
*  People should all be saying what the so-called never Trumpers, the former Republicans who [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=517.2800000000001s)]
*  are now out beating the drums to say, you cannot support him and you cannot support [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=520.96s)]
*  the people who support his attitude toward our country. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=527.36s)]
*  On the issue of healing and getting better as a country on this, in reading your article [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=533.7s)]
*  in the Atlantic, I feel like I get the diagnosis. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=539.6s)]
*  You talk about surgeon general, having essentially diagnosed this problem of loneliness being [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=544.52s)]
*  a health problem in this country. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=549.76s)]
*  You describe it as a real political problem as well. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=551.16s)]
*  And I get in a very fundamental way, this idea that atomized disconnected populations [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=554.02s)]
*  are really primed for extremism. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=562.56s)]
*  That's part of what makes us vulnerable to the call of strongman leadership and authoritarianism [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=564.64s)]
*  and makes us susceptible to it like any other number of mature democracies around the world. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=570.04s)]
*  What I don't get is the prescription for how to fix that and whether that is a prescription [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=574.84s)]
*  that should come from people who want to be political leaders or whether that's something [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=579.12s)]
*  we need to cure as a culture in some other way. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=582.52s)]
*  What's the way out of it? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=585.52s)]
*  Well, I think it's cultural, political and probably economic as well. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=586.52s)]
*  I think we have to do a much better job of finding ways for people to work together again, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=591.24s)]
*  work together on community projects, work together through existing organizations, whether [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=600.1999999999999s)]
*  it be civic or religious. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=605.16s)]
*  Look at the outpouring of help for the people in Maui right now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=607.9599999999999s)]
*  That kind of volunteer effort that is so American, so much at the core of who we are when we [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=612.72s)]
*  are at our best. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  But I also think that we have to do a better job of trying to stand up against the divisiveness [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  and against the constant stream of lies and falsehoods that come out of not just politicians [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=626.88s)]
*  but also social media and other sources of information. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=635.4000000000001s)]
*  So there's enough work for all of us to do. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=640.2s)]
*  It's not just political leaders. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=643.14s)]
*  It's really everybody saying, you know, this country is too precious, too valuable, too [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=644.76s)]
*  important to allow it to continue to be fragmented the way it has been and rebuilding that sense [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=649.2800000000001s)]
*  of trust and community is no easy task. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=656.36s)]
*  I don't think anybody would argue with how difficult it would be. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  But there are ways of doing it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=664.24s)]
*  And let me just say, you know, I don't think Joe Biden gets credit enough for trying to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=666.32s)]
*  model responsible leadership, you know, just kind of getting up every day, doing the job. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=671.76s)]
*  The legislative accomplishments that came out of his first, you know, year and a half [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=680.64s)]
*  were amazing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  We're rebuilding our infrastructure. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=686.1999999999999s)]
*  We're once again investing in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and so much more. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=688.64s)]
*  We're trying to, from a legislative perspective, under his leadership, to put back into place [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=694.9599999999999s)]
*  some of the things that give people a sense, perhaps, of security and confidence, optimism [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  about the future. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, what more can a leader do? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=708.76s)]
*  I mean, really, when you come down and think about it, you know, we've got Democratic governors [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  now who are making school lunch free. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, that's a big deal because, unfortunately, we have a whole lot of kids who don't get [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  adequate nutrition. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=722.96s)]
*  And we have Republican governors who are lowering the age of employment so that 13 and 14-year-olds [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=723.96s)]
*  can now be put to work. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=729.44s)]
*  That is, in a nutshell, kind of where we are. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=731.64s)]
*  Why wouldn't we want to join hands and support families in a difficult time and particularly [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  try to give kids more stability to be able to have better choices instead of just ripping [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=741.56s)]
*  away every social support? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=747.88s)]
*  So this has to happen at all levels of politics, government, but more broadly, society as well. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is overseeing an economy that's had the lowest peacetime unemployment since [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=758.6s)]
*  World War II, lowest levels of poverty, lowest levels of uninsured, people uninsured in terms [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=765.52s)]
*  of health insurance ever in the history of the country. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=772.6s)]
*  And you just said laudatory things about him in terms of the kinds of leadership that he's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  modeling. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=779.84s)]
*  And yet, you know, this is where this is going. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=780.84s)]
*  His approval ratings aren't strong and his prospects for reelection are sort of middling [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=785.48s)]
*  at best. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  What do you see as the disconnect there? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=790.8000000000001s)]
*  Look, I think it is true that a lot of people in our country don't even know what he's done. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  And part of that is they don't get their news from MSNBC. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=799.28s)]
*  They get their news from social media if they get any news at all. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=802.48s)]
*  They don't have the kind of information that would give them confidence in knowing what [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=806.14s)]
*  their government is doing. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=813.24s)]
*  We have this bizarre situation where bridges are being built and roads are being fixed [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=815.16s)]
*  and people who didn't vote for the money to do that are claiming credit for it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=821.48s)]
*  And how are citizens supposed to make up their minds? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  So we have a splintered information ecosystem which really works to the disadvantage of [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=828.1999999999999s)]
*  somebody who is not a performer in a political theater sense but is a producer in a political [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=835.16s)]
*  results sense. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=843.54s)]
*  How long can you talk about infrastructure? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=845.52s)]
*  It gets boring. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=847.3s)]
*  Let's change and talk about Donald Trump or one of these other people who do nothing but [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=848.3s)]
*  give us negative messages because that is so much more exciting. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=854.0999999999999s)]
*  And at the end of the day, how people get their information is the basis on which they [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=858.2199999999999s)]
*  make decisions in a democracy. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=862.18s)]
*  And we have a very difficult time breaking through that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=864.74s)]
*  So I have a lot of sympathy for what the White House goes through every day trying [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=868.22s)]
*  to get through to people so that they at least know, look what's been done. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=875.32s)]
*  You can make your judgment one way or the other but at least know what we are doing [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=879.78s)]
*  in your community to try to get us better prepared for the future. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=884.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, the United States is the best positioned country in the world for the future. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=888.26s)]
*  And to think that we have leaders and people in our own country who tear us down, who [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=894.22s)]
*  undermine us, who root against us, even sometimes rooting for our adversaries is just incredibly [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=900.1s)]
*  difficult to accept. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=908.0600000000001s)]
*  So we have a lot of work to do and I hope that more people will be willing to kind of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=909.9s)]
*  take up the burden and try to deal with this sense of divisiveness, loneliness, fragmentation [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=916.6600000000001s)]
*  that really gives fertile ground for people like Trump to unfortunately peddle their wares. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGqNUlFBjBI&t=923.64s)]
