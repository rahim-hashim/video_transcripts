# Idaho Republicans Reckon With Extremism In Political Spectacle Primary
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI)
*  Take air superiority and then roll in with your tanks on the ground like Trupas' lawsuits. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=0.0s)]
*  Blitzkrieg! [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=7.2s)]
*  Mr. Brown, the question was about taxes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=8.2s)]
*  Back when they told me that we couldn't home school, I prayed about it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=11.44s)]
*  I stood on my hind legs like a man. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=15.32s)]
*  I told them what I thought of them and the television would talk to me for 30 minutes [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=17.32s)]
*  or an hour. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=21.88s)]
*  As it says in my motorcycle club, hay diddle fiddle right up the middle. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=22.88s)]
*  That's my style. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=28.12s)]
*  Our wolves, they're here because we let somebody put them here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Governor Otter wants to kill a wolf. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=34.04s)]
*  I did kill a wolf while it was still on endangered species. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=35.4s)]
*  So that was a crazy year in Republican politics in the state of Idaho. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=40.32s)]
*  That was their Republican gubernatorial debate that year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=44.6s)]
*  Those were their candidates for governor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=48.0s)]
*  This was 2014. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=50.08s)]
*  The incumbent governor was Butch Otter, a pretty conservative Republican with a real [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=51.08s)]
*  fun name. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=56.44s)]
*  But he was not conservative enough for right-wing activists in Idaho who wanted to primary him [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=57.96s)]
*  out of office. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=62.44s)]
*  That year, Idaho conservatives threw their support mostly behind a Tea Party challenger. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=63.96s)]
*  He's the guy you see on the right side, far right side of the stage. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  But when it came time for the candidates to debate, nobody paid much attention to the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=72.68s)]
*  Tea Party guy because, oh my god, who's the biker guy and what's with the hay diddle [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=75.64s)]
*  diddle from him? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=79.68s)]
*  And why did that 120-year-old man just say he killed a wolf and his TV talks just to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=80.88s)]
*  him? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=85.88s)]
*  Butch Otter would go on to win that gubernatorial primary and the election that year. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=87.48s)]
*  He served as governor in Idaho for another four years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=91.88s)]
*  But at the end of that four years, when Butch Otter left office, he endorsed his lieutenant [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=95.8s)]
*  governor, a man named Brad Little, to be his replacement. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=99.12s)]
*  It's like a fairy tale. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Butch Otter handing off to Brad Little. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=104.4s)]
*  Now, which is the one that eats no fat and which one eats no lean? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=107.0s)]
*  It's just part of the joy of covering Idaho Republican politics. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=110.68s)]
*  Butch Otter endorsed his lieutenant governor, Brad Little. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=115.88s)]
*  Brad Little becomes governor. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=118.44s)]
*  The person who replaces him to become the new lieutenant governor was this person. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=121.24s)]
*  All of us are by nature free and equal and have certain inalienable rights, among which [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=135.4s)]
*  and pursuing happiness and securing safety. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=142.36s)]
*  Wait for it. Here comes the gun. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=148.68s)]
*  Here comes the gun. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=150.24s)]
*  That's Idaho's current lieutenant governor, Janice McEachin. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  She was brandishing a gun in that video in order to keep her Bible warm and in order [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=154.36s)]
*  to pressure the governor, her boss, that he should undo covid rules back in 2020. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  One time when Governor Little left the state, McEachin actually took it upon herself to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  announce that she had seized the powers of the governorship and proclaimed the state's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=170.24s)]
*  mask and vaccine rules to be hereby null and void because the governor was out of town. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=174.76s)]
*  Earlier this year, Ms. McEachin participated in a white supremacist conference at which [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=180.96s)]
*  attendees cheered on Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=185.0s)]
*  She's also, as you've probably guessed by now, an enthusiastic election denier. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=189.32s)]
*  The reason I'm telling you all of this is because tomorrow that lieutenant governor, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Janice McEachin, is going to face off against her boss, the incumbent governor, Brad Little, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=197.04s)]
*  in the Idaho Republican primary for governor. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=202.4s)]
*  Naturally, because she's an election denier, Janice McEachin earned the endorsement of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  former President Donald Trump. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=210.28s)]
*  She's not the only right-wing election denier running for statewide office in Idaho. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=212.28s)]
*  There's no incumbent in the secretary of state in Idaho. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=215.88s)]
*  Two of the three Republican candidates who are running to be secretary of state are also [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=218.84s)]
*  election deniers who say that President Trump won the election and President Biden is a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  usurper. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=226.84s)]
*  The Republican attorney general in Idaho is also being primary tomorrow by another election [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=227.84s)]
*  denier. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=232.32s)]
*  I know there's a lot of attention on the Pennsylvania Republican primary tomorrow where there is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=233.32s)]
*  deep, deep insanity in the Republican primary races for governor and senate and even for [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=238.16s)]
*  lieutenant governor. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=243.24s)]
*  But I'm telling you, don't sleep on Idaho. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=244.24s)]
*  Idaho is tomorrow too, and there is plenty of crazy to go around. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=247.6s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnSOusFniCI&t=251.64000000000001s)]
