# Trump's Fake Elector Scheme Becomes More Than Just A Scandal
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY)
*  These fake documents, these forged documents with fake electoral votes, this part of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=0.0s)]
*  plot has since emerged as a matter of potential criminal prosecution in at least two states [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=7.36s)]
*  and at the federal level. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=12.8s)]
*  So for example, on the first question here, was it illegal? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  And did—the first question here, was it illegal? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=19.42s)]
*  Did they know it was illegal? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=21.66s)]
*  The January 6 investigators have given us a resounding yes on both of those. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  The January 6 investigators have shown testimony that not only did the White House Counsel's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=29.22s)]
*  Office conclude that the fake electors' plan was illegal, the White House Counsel's Office [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=33.18s)]
*  formally notified White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=38.3s)]
*  and all the other people who happened to be allowed into their meeting about it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=44.08s)]
*  The White House Counsel's Office told them outright at the White House that the fake [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  electors' thing was illegal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=53.06s)]
*  Even beyond them showing that just all the lawyers knew it was illegal, the investigation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=55.62s)]
*  also showed that some of the people who participated, some of the people who signed their names [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  on these forged documents, who signed up to be the fake electors, they asked, as they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  did so, for the Trump campaign to please agree in advance to pay their legal fees in case [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=70.52s)]
*  they were sued or arrested for trying to pull this off. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=77.42s)]
*  Next crucial question. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=82.38s)]
*  Did they try to pull it off anyway? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=83.98s)]
*  Of course they tried to pull it off anyway. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  They did in fact forge fake Electoral College slates of votes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  They mailed them into the National Archives as if they were real, hoping they'd be counted [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=92.42s)]
*  as if they were real. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=96.36s)]
*  So was it illegal? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=98.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=99.92s)]
*  Did they know it was illegal? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=100.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=101.92s)]
*  Did they try to pull it off anyway? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=102.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=103.92s)]
*  Was it occasionally hilarious when they did so? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=104.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=106.94s)]
*  He told me that the Michigan Republican electors were planning to meet in the Capitol and hide [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  overnight so that they could fulfill the role of casting their vote in, per law, in the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=118.82s)]
*  Michigan chambers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=128.22s)]
*  And I told him in no uncertain terms that that was insane and inappropriate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=133.7s)]
*  Plotting to sneak into the Capitol the night before and hide out overnight like in cupboards [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=140.73999999999998s)]
*  or something, so they could pop out and surprise everybody at the right moment and say, Neener, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=145.26s)]
*  Neener, we have beaten the real electors to the punch and so now we're the real electors [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=151.14s)]
*  or something. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=156.26s)]
*  Like, as if that's how presidents are chosen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=157.26s)]
*  We also know that there was this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=159.94s)]
*  This is a text message exchange showed by the January 6 investigators. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=163.5s)]
*  Vice President Pence's staffer are the little bubbles on the right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=167.54s)]
*  You see the first one starting the conversation there from that staffer. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=171.06s)]
*  Sup, as in what's up? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=174.7s)]
*  And then on the left side you see bubbles there from a staffer, chief of staff, to Senator [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=177.38s)]
*  Ron Johnson. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=181.3s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson's staffer says, Johnson needs to hand something to the vice president. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=183.34s)]
*  Please advise. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=188.18s)]
*  The vice president's staffer responds, what is it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=189.18s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson's chief of staff responds, alternate slate of electors for Michigan and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=192.26s)]
*  Wisconsin because archivists didn't receive them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=196.38s)]
*  The vice president's staffer says in response, do not give that to him. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=199.38s)]
*  This was just min, these are all time stamped, right? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=205.06s)]
*  So you can see this is January 6th in the noon hour. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=207.06s)]
*  This was just minutes before Vice President Pence was supposed to actually count the electoral [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=210.22s)]
*  college votes, which is actually how we count the votes for president in this country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  Hey, Senator Johnson needs to hand the vice president two of these forged fake elector [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  certificates before the counting starts. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=225.5s)]
*  How do we do that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=228.06s)]
*  What? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=230.06s)]
*  Also, why was Senator Ron Johnson volunteering to do that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=231.06s)]
*  Why was he even involved? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=235.46s)]
*  How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate slate [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=239.54s)]
*  of electors? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=243.82s)]
*  I'm on the phone right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=244.82s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=246.82s)]
*  I can see your phone. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  I can see your screen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  Can you explain what your chief of staff was doing? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  Does your chief of staff still work for you, Senator? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=259.3s)]
*  Can you explain what happened there? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=261.3s)]
*  Why was your chief of staff even offering this to the vice president? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=263.3s)]
*  This is a complete non-story. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=267.3s)]
*  We just issued a statement. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=269.3s)]
*  This is a non-story. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=271.3s)]
*  I don't know what you're even saying about this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, they said that your chief of staff was saying that you offered, you wanted to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  tell the alternate elector, the vice president Mike Pence. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  This was a staff-to-staff exchange, and I was basically unaware of it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  And the chief of staff contacted the vice president's staff, said, do you want this? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  They said no, and we didn't deliver it, and that's the end of the story. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  Why was he even asking for that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=302.26s)]
*  Because somebody delivered this to our office and asked to deliver that to the vice president. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=304.26s)]
*  Did you support his efforts to try to get those slates to the vice president? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=308.26s)]
*  No, I had no knowledge of this. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=312.26s)]
*  Who's the person that delivered it? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=314.26s)]
*  I had no involvement in an alternative slate of electors. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=316.26s)]
*  I had no idea this thing would be delivered to us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=320.26s)]
*  It got delivered staff-to-staff. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=322.26s)]
*  My chief of staff did the right thing, contacted the vice president's staff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=324.26s)]
*  They said they didn't want it, so we didn't deliver it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=328.26s)]
*  And that's the end of the story. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=330.74s)]
*  I had no knowledge of this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=332.74s)]
*  I don't even know who gave this thing to us. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=334.74s)]
*  I didn't have anything to do with it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=336.74s)]
*  I didn't ask who it came from. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=338.74s)]
*  I just volunteered that I would take this thing that I didn't know anything about, and I didn't know who it came from, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=340.74s)]
*  and I didn't have anything to do with it, and I didn't even support it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=344.74s)]
*  But it was something, I don't know what, that needed to go to the vice president, and hey, I'm a senator. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=346.74s)]
*  And that's one of the things we do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=350.74s)]
*  We hand-deliver mail and packages to the vice president all the time. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=354.74s)]
*  You know, sometimes it's catalogs, and you can assume he probably doesn't want them, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=358.22s)]
*  but maybe it's something that he really likes, and he likes to go through those catalogs. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=361.22s)]
*  Sometimes it looks important. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=364.22s)]
*  I don't know, I'm just a mule. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=365.22s)]
*  I also take out the recycling sometimes, and I do beer runs, whatever. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=366.22s)]
*  I'm, you know. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=369.22s)]
*  What else do senators do? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=371.22s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson, I'm on the phone. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=373.22s)]
*  No, you're not, Senator. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=376.22s)]
*  We can see that there is nothing happening on the screen of your phone. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=377.22s)]
*  I'm just going to keep holding this to my face for a little while, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=380.22s)]
*  so you'll pretend that you didn't notice that I'm not on the phone, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=383.22s)]
*  and I'll put it down without saying anything. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=387.70000000000005s)]
*  But it also should be noted, this part of it, this line that we've highlighted here [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  from the senator's chief of staff, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=395.70000000000005s)]
*  Senator Johnson needs to hand-deliver these fake elector certificates to the vice president [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  because the archivists didn't receive them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=400.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=404.70000000000005s)]
*  We know in fact that the archives did receive them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, here they are, sent registered mail weeks earlier from Wisconsin and Michigan [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  and received by the National Archives. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=415.18s)]
*  These are the National Archives records. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=417.18s)]
*  As Kyle Cheney at Politico was first to point out earlier today, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=419.18s)]
*  we know that the National Archives received these. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=422.18s)]
*  This was not some lost-in-the-mail problem where Senator Ron Johnson had to sub in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=426.18s)]
*  at the last second as the slowest leg ever on the Pony Express. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=431.18s)]
*  I mean, the archivist had these. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=434.18s)]
*  The archivist in reality is in charge of receiving the actual certified legal electoral votes [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=436.18s)]
*  from the states and then giving those real electoral votes to the vice president [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=442.66s)]
*  so he can count them on January 6th. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=447.66s)]
*  The archivist did that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=450.66s)]
*  That is why Pence had the real certified electoral votes physically, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=452.66s)]
*  hard copies of them, to count on January 6th. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=455.66s)]
*  The archivist sent Mike Pence the real vote. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=458.66s)]
*  The archivist just didn't also give Pence the junk mail, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=461.66s)]
*  the illegal, counterfeit, not certified fake electoral slates to. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=465.66s)]
*  Yes, they had them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=469.66s)]
*  We know that they had received them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=471.14000000000004s)]
*  They just didn't pass that junk onto the actual vice president [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=473.14000000000004s)]
*  for the actual counting of the real electoral votes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  So what Senator Ron Johnson and his office were trying to arrange [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=479.14000000000004s)]
*  at the very last minute before Pence started counting, started the count, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=482.14000000000004s)]
*  was to use this false claim. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=486.14000000000004s)]
*  Oh, hey, you know, we understand the vice president is supposed to have these, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  but for some reason, the archives didn't get them. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=491.14000000000004s)]
*  But don't worry, Senator Ron Johnson can courier them over himself and hand deliver them. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  They were using this false claim about the archives [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=499.62s)]
*  to try to give the vice president forged fake votes in time for the count. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=501.62s)]
*  Nice. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=508.62s)]
*  Call your office, Senator. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=510.62s)]
*  Maybe turn your phone on this time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=512.62s)]
*  So, was it illegal? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=514.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=516.62s)]
*  Did they know it? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=517.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=518.62s)]
*  Did they try it anyway? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=519.62s)]
*  Sadly, yes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=520.62s)]
*  Was it occasionally hilarious when they did so? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=521.62s)]
*  Of course it was. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=522.62s)]
*  Next crucial question. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=524.62s)]
*  Did they get caught? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=526.62s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=529.1s)]
*  Here's a federal judge ruling that Trump's lawyer, John Eastman, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=531.1s)]
*  his communications on this matter, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=534.1s)]
*  must be released to the January 6th investigation [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=536.1s)]
*  because those communications are evidence of a possible crime. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=538.1s)]
*  Yes, they got caught. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=543.1s)]
*  I mean, here's the January 6th investigation looking at this very closely, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=544.1s)]
*  starting to reveal all their findings about it, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=547.1s)]
*  including Trump campaign lawyers and people who worked on the scheme [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=550.1s)]
*  for the Trump campaign in multiple states [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=553.1s)]
*  saying, saying in their sworn depositions, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=555.1s)]
*  yeah, it was illegal and they wish they'd never had anything to do with it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=557.58s)]
*  Here's that pained deposition they played excerpts from yesterday, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=560.58s)]
*  a pained deposition from the head of the Republican Party, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=564.58s)]
*  RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=568.58s)]
*  The RNC had previously denied to reporters [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=570.58s)]
*  that they had anything to do with this fake electors scheme. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=573.58s)]
*  But hey, look, under oath, there's Ronna Romney McDaniel now admitting [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=576.58s)]
*  that yes, actually the RNC helped put the fake electors together [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=580.58s)]
*  and that it was Trump personally, Trump himself, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=585.0600000000001s)]
*  the former president himself who called her personally [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  and asked her to help with the fake electors scheme. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=593.0600000000001s)]
*  So yes, they got caught, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  up to and including the president's personal involvement in it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  And as much discussion as there has been [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  about whether there will be criminal prosecutions [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  for the plot to overthrow the government [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=609.0600000000001s)]
*  that has been exposed by the January 6th investigation, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=611.0600000000001s)]
*  this part of it, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=613.54s)]
*  this part of it is where we already know [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=614.54s)]
*  there are multiple federal and state criminal investigations underway. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=616.54s)]
*  We've been able to report here on the show, including today, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=620.54s)]
*  that multiple Georgia Republicans who were asked to participate [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=623.54s)]
*  in the fake electors scheme, but who chose not to for whatever reason, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=627.54s)]
*  multiple Georgia Republicans in that position have been interviewed [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=630.54s)]
*  and or have testified before three different entities. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=635.54s)]
*  The January 6th committee, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=639.54s)]
*  the FBI, and also the criminal investigation [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=642.02s)]
*  being led by state prosecutors working out of Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=645.02s)]
*  And now today, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=650.02s)]
*  what is being described as a major escalation [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=652.02s)]
*  of the federal criminal investigation into these matters. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=655.02s)]
*  The Washington Post was first to the story with this headline today. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=657.02s)]
*  January 6th probe expands with fresh subpoenas in multiple states. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=660.02s)]
*  Recipients of subpoenas include a state party chairman [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=665.02s)]
*  as officials probe deeper into pro-Trump efforts [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=668.02s)]
*  to use invalid electors to try to thwart Biden's 2020 victory. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=671.5s)]
*  Illegal? Yes. They knew it? Yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=676.5s)]
*  They tried it anyway? Yes. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=678.5s)]
*  To hilarious effect? Yes, of course. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=680.5s)]
*  But yes, they have been caught doing it. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=682.5s)]
*  With active criminal grand jury investigations [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=684.5s)]
*  at both the federal and state level [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=686.5s)]
*  and the federal investigation today appears to have widely expanded. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=688.5s)]
*  And that, of course, just leaves us with the last question. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=694.5s)]
*  Does anybody actually end up getting in trouble here? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=697.98s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czA_oHaVXAY&t=701.98s)]
