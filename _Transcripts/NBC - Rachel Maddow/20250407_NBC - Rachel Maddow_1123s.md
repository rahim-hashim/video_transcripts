*  sign, see on the back of the table there, on the back on the right? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=298.96s)]
*  I had guessed when we showed this picture on Friday night that the lady making the dump [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=303.24s)]
*  Trump sign with the legs sticking out of the trash can, I had guessed she must have been [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  an artist or an art teacher. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=310.4s)]

*  I am here to protest Trump's programs. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=319.42s)]
*  They are hurting us. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=327.7s)]
*  They are hurting our children. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=329.74s)]
*  And before long, they will hurt the country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=332.82s)]
*  So we have to dump Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=337.18s)]
*  You know, the thing I most want to be when I grow up is an old person. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=345.22s)]

*  The reason I wanted to show all of those signs from these various protests is because some [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=693.7s)]
*  of them are very funny. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=696.34s)]
*  But also because it shows you just a slice of how many different reasons people participated [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=698.34s)]
*  in these protests. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=705.14s)]
*  And how many different reasons people have to be mad at this administration and to be [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=706.14s)]
*  willing to stand up and protest against this administration. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=711.26s)]
*  And if you're just thinking about how things are going to go in our country and what this [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=715.26s)]
*  means strategically, what it means baseline, whether or not you protested this weekend, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=718.22s)]
*  whether or not you're even in sympathy with the people who protested this weekend. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=722.86s)]
*  The huge variety of reasons people protested this weekend tells you that the proverbial [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=726.14s)]
*  tent of people allied against Donald Trump right now is really, really, really big. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=732.38s)]
*  He's done enough in these 70, 80, whatever days to make a very large number of people [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=739.02s)]
*  mad at him and want to resist him for a million different reasons. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=746.06s)]
*  And strategically, for the resistance against Trump, that's good. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=751.82s)]
*  That's how you get more than 1,400 protests in all 50 states, including not one but a [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=754.54s)]
*  bunch that hit 100,000 people or more. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=760.22s)]
*  And in all of these protests, in all 50 states, there was no violence. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=764.9399999999999s)]
*  There was no vandalism. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=769.9s)]
*  There were no reported arrests of any protesters anywhere. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=772.02s)]
*  In one town in Indiana, there was one report of one guy arrested who was a bystander, but [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=776.22s)]
*  then they let him go and that was it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=780.62s)]
*  This was just a massive show of American people standing up peacefully saying, no way, nope, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=783.6600000000001s)]
*  we are not having it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=790.7s)]
*  And no, we don't know what the direct impact of what these protests will be, what these [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=793.3000000000001s)]
*  protests will ultimately do. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=798.6600000000001s)]
*  You almost never see that as a direct consequence of a rally. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=800.14s)]
*  You never know exactly what it's going to do. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=807.5s)]
*  That said, there is a family that is coming home today to Sacketts Harbor in New York, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=810.74s)]
*  after almost that entire town showed up on Saturday to demand that they be returned. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=817.7s)]
*  But everyone from Palm Beach Gardens, near Trump's golf course in Florida, to Anchorage, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=825.82s)]
*  Alaska, to the huge crowd that turned out in Salem, Oregon, to the big crowd that turned [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=832.62s)]
*  out in Frankfort, Kentucky. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=839.3s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=840.78s)]
*  To the huge crowd that we saw, massive crowd that we saw in Minnesota and St. Paul at the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=843.9399999999999s)]
*  state capitol there. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=848.58s)]
*  I can tell you, one of the consequences of these people turning out in so many places [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=850.34s)]
*  this weekend and in such great numbers, one of the direct consequences we absolutely can [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=854.46s)]
*  measure is that everybody in all of these places knows that if they themselves are upset [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=858.58s)]
*  or worried or mad or scared about what this administration is doing, they know they are [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=863.54s)]
*  not alone. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=867.98s)]
*  We, the whole country, know that the people are not just taking things lying down. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=868.98s)]
*  The people are now proving that they will show up and they will do it everywhere. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=875.1800000000001s)]
*  And likely, frequently, this is a point that I haven't heard made all that widely in [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=882.74s)]
*  the wake of these protests. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=890.22s)]
*  But I think one of the important things strategically about the fact that this wasn't just one [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=891.22s)]
*  big protest in Washington, D.C. this weekend. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=895.86s)]
*  I mean, it was a very big protest in Washington, D.C. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=898.46s)]
*  It was over 100,000 people in Washington, which is a big deal. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=901.1400000000001s)]
*  The fact that it wasn't just Washington, that Washington was just one protest among [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=906.0600000000001s)]
*  many is actually, I think, tactically, one of the smart things that the organizers of [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=910.3000000000001s)]
*  this weekend's protest did. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=916.1800000000001s)]
*  Because holding disparate protests all over the country, not just one big protest in one [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=918.0400000000001s)]
*  place, means that people can do this again and again and again. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=922.38s)]
*  I mean, you look at really effective protest movements against rising authoritarianism [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=928.38s)]
*  in countries like Poland, where the population essentially rose up and took their democracy [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=933.34s)]
*  back through frequent mass protest. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=938.62s)]
*  One of the things you realize about mass peaceful protest movements fighting against authoritarian [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=941.66s)]
*  takeover is that they have to stay peaceful and they have to be relentless. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=946.26s)]
*  They have to frequently, frequently, frequently protest again and again and again. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  And it is hard and it is expensive to get yourself to travel to some faraway capital [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  to protest if the protest is always in the capital. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=962.52s)]
*  But it's not hard or expensive to get yourself to your town square or to the downtown in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=966.12s)]
*  the city nearest you or maybe even to your state capital, even if you have to do it time [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=971.78s)]
*  after time after time. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=976.52s)]
*  And when we have seen it work against rising authoritarians in European countries and all [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=979.38s)]
*  over the world, frankly, it has been that the protests have been recurrent. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=985.9s)]
*  And I believe that is what we are about to start seeing in the United States of America, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=991.24s)]
*  because this was April 5th. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=994.74s)]
*  But it looks like it's going to happen again in two weeks, on April 19th. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=997.26s)]
*  Saw you there on Saturday. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1003.86s)]
*  See you there two Saturdays from now. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1005.36s)]
*  Sustainable, repetitive, peaceful, nonviolent, big tent, everyone welcome demonstrations [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1007.66s)]
*  with yes, kids there, also dogs, also old people, also righteous indignation and fear [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1015.5799999999999s)]
*  and sadness and also music and funny signs and a determination to outclass, to outlast [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1023.8199999999999s)]
*  and to ultimately put down a would-be authoritarian revolution. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1030.58s)]
*  Persistence. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1036.22s)]
*  In Reuters Ipsos polling last week, the proportion of the American public who said they strongly [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1039.8600000000001s)]
*  identify with the MAGA movement is 11 percent of the population. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1045.58s)]
*  The proportion of the American public who says they do not identify with the MAGA movement [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1049.8600000000001s)]
*  at all is 52 percent of the population. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1053.78s)]
*  In the Marquette University poll that came out last week, Elon Musk's approval rating [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1059.3s)]
*  is underwater by 17 points. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1063.6399999999999s)]
*  Americans say Trump's tariffs will hurt them rather than help them by a margin of [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1067.1599999999999s)]
*  30 points. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1070.6799999999998s)]
*  Americans say they are against Donald Trump closing the Department of Education by a margin [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1072.36s)]

*  Americans say they are against Trump's threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st state [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1078.36s)]
*  by a margin of 50 points. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1083.54s)]
*  What Trump is doing and what he most wants to be known for is not popular, is deeply, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1086.32s)]
*  unpopular. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1093.12s)]
*  But protesting against him sure looks like it's popular. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1096.12s)]
*  Expect more of it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr4YwdXtnnA&t=1101.04s)]
