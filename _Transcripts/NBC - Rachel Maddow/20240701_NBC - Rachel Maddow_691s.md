# Past bad acts of felon Trump amplify the danger of Supreme Court's 'potentially catastrophic' ruling
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0)
*  I concur with Justice Sotomayor's dissent today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=0.0s)]
*  She hears what she said. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=4.16s)]
*  She said, in every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=5.16s)]
*  With fear for our democracy, I dissent, end of quote. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Associate the American people dissent. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=16.84s)]
*  I dissent. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=20.76s)]
*  President Biden tonight at the White House responding to the Supreme Court's ruling [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=23.52s)]
*  that hands presidents, including himself, absolute immunity from prosecution for anything [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=26.52s)]
*  they can successfully argue was an official act. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=33.2s)]
*  The president name checked Justice Sonia Sotomayor's blistering dissent, which she delivered from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=37.36s)]
*  the bench at the court today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=42.72s)]
*  That dissent started quote, today's decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=44.6s)]
*  reshapes the institution of the presidency. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=49.56s)]
*  It makes a mockery of the principle foundational to our constitution and system of government [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=52.32s)]
*  that no man is above the law, relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=56.88s)]
*  the need for bold and unhesitating action by the president. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=61.8s)]
*  The court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=65.92s)]
*  She said, quote, because our constitution does not shield a former president from answering [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=70.92s)]
*  for criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=75.5s)]
*  And she laid out the basis for her dissent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=80.24s)]
*  Normally, when Supreme Court justices dissent, they use the word respectfully, saying, I [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  respectfully dissent today. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=86.44s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor and also Justice Katanji Brown Jackson each struck the word respectfully [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=88.88s)]
*  and just wrote, I dissent. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=93.44s)]
*  And that is the kind of reaction we are seeing from legal scholars and experts everywhere [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=95.78s)]
*  today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=99.84s)]
*  NPR's veteran legal correspondent Nina Totenberg just telling us moments ago that legal observers [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=100.84s)]
*  and experts, including what she described as sort of the both sides of the aisle, meaning [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  both sides of the ideological number line, were, in her words, astonished by how radical [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=110.08s)]
*  this ruling was today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=116.28s)]
*  Sherrilyn Eifel, the former president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=118.12s)]
*  Fund, she responded to the ruling today by saying this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=122.04s)]
*  She said, quote, Today's decision in Trump versus United States is a grotesque and hideous [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=125.28s)]
*  distortion of the rule of law by a majority of the highest court of the most powerful [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=130.52s)]
*  democracy in the world. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=135.76s)]
*  The national and global implications of upending this core principle of democracy has potentially [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=137.48s)]
*  catastrophic national and global implications. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  Catastrophic. Joining us now is Sherrilyn Eifel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  She is now the Vernon E. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=149.88s)]
*  Jordan, Jr. Distinguished Chair in Civil Rights at Howard Law School. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=151.12s)]
*  Ms. Eifel, I'm it makes me happy to see your face. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=155.88s)]
*  I'm really glad that you could be here tonight of all nights. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for making the time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=161.16s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  So Justice Roberts criticized the liberal justice's dissent today, said they were [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=165.8s)]
*  striking a tone of chilling doom, essentially saying calm down, ladies, accusing them of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=172.96s)]
*  overreacting and portraying this ruling's consequences as something that they are not. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  You clearly think the consequences of this ruling are, in your words, potentially catastrophic. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=184.12s)]
*  Can you explain why you think so? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel, for having me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=194.08s)]
*  That was part of what was so disturbing about Chief Justice Roberts' opinion. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=197.0s)]
*  If you're going to burn the house down, don't be mad that people call it arson. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=201.56s)]
*  This decision is, I talked about it being, having catastrophic consequences because [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=207.12s)]
*  precisely of what Justice Sotomayor says about the rule of law. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=213.72000000000003s)]
*  There is no question about what the rule of law means. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  It means that the law applies equally to all rich and poor, high born and low born, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=219.76s)]
*  black, white, Latino. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=227.04s)]
*  It means that the one that one principle of law applies to everyone equally. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=229.8s)]
*  And the president, once he is no longer a president, is a citizen of the United States. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=235.4s)]
*  And therefore, the presumption is that he is covered as well by the rule of law. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=240.8s)]
*  To shatter that today is so incredibly shocking that I think many people are back on their heels. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=245.44s)]
*  And I say that it has global implications because our country is a tremendously influential [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=253.0s)]
*  country because of our power, because of our history, because of our national identity that we have [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=259.24s)]
*  worked so hard to press to other nations. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=265.76s)]
*  We have held ourselves up as an exemplar of democracy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=270.64s)]
*  And for the highest court in our land to send a signal, not only to those in this country, but to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=275.12s)]
*  the rest of the world, that the rule of law is something that can be interrupted for a president [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=279.84s)]
*  of your same political party is incredibly dangerous. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  And the worst part of it, Rachel, is this is not a theoretical conversation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=289.84s)]
*  We actually have experience with former President Trump. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=294.44s)]
*  We know what he is capable of. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  We know the kind of excesses that he would like to and did engage in as president. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=300.88s)]
*  So this is not a case in which the court did not have before it the evidence of someone who would [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=307.28s)]
*  dangerously use the power that they so recklessly put in the hands of any president today. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  I was interested in the way that Justice Sotomayor and her dissent kept going back to the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  particularities of the indictment and Trump's conduct, as if to say this is not a theoretical matter. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  This is not something that we are describing, describing or deciding in the abstract. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=328.8s)]
*  I think making making that exact point implicitly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=334.32s)]
*  Let me ask you about the very dark potential consequence of this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=338.12s)]
*  And this, again, was raised explicitly by Justice Sotomayor. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  The implications of the hypothetical assassination scenario. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=347.76s)]
*  You know, let's say a president ordered an element of the military to carry out an attack on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=352.44s)]
*  somebody who we saw as a danger or as a political rival. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=360.12s)]
*  The justices seem to have made clear that that if the order to kill the person could be [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  construed as something that was official, that the immunity matter is settled and that would [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=370.8s)]
*  actually be something for which a president could never be prosecuted. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  Is it that simple? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=379.68s)]
*  I mean, how would that actually work in the legal system? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=380.84s)]
*  You know, it seems it seems impossible to imagine that that could be what they mean, although the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=386.44s)]
*  plain reading of what they wrote, that is what they mean. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=391.0s)]
*  And we have a former president who, you remember, asked his defense secretary why we why they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=393.52s)]
*  couldn't just shoot protesters, Black Lives Matter protesters in the legs. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  This is someone who actually thinks in that way. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=405.0s)]
*  Now, one of the things that held Trump back when he was president was that very often the people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=408.28s)]
*  around him would not carry out the things he asked them to do. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=413.56s)]
*  He asked his White House counsel over and over again to fire Jeff Sessions and he wouldn't do it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=416.68s)]
*  He constantly asked people to do things and they would ignore him knowing that he wouldn't do it [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=421.8s)]
*  himself. He wouldn't do it himself because he was at that time unsure of his liability. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  Now he is sure that this Supreme Court thinks he would have no liability. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=432.52s)]
*  So first of all, we have a category of things he can do himself. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=436.36s)]
*  He can strip military members from from their ranks for not following his orders. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  He can accept cash bribes for pardons. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=446.44s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of things he can do, but then he also can order others to do things. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  And the people that he's going to have if he is elected in his cabinet in his second round [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=455.32s)]
*  are going to be people of considerably less restraint than those he had the first time around. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=460.68s)]
*  And they were not particularly restrained. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=465.48s)]
*  So what this court has opened up to us is a true danger. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=468.12s)]
*  It has unleashed the full power of someone who has shown themselves to be utterly unfit [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  to lead this country, someone who has no regard for restraint or ethics. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=477.8s)]
*  And the fact that you can litigate it later, the fact that you can return to the district court [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=483.8s)]
*  or that you can address these matters in a lower court to make their way back up to the Supreme [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=491.08s)]
*  Court won't change the fact that people will be harmed, that people can be harmed, and that our [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=497.32s)]
*  systems of government and that the rule of law can be even further degraded. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=502.76s)]
*  Somewhere along the way, there are a majority of justices on this court who decided that they [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=506.76s)]
*  needed to be the last word on everything, that they could no longer trust the apparatus of democracy. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=511.88s)]
*  They could no longer trust federal agencies, thus overturning Chevron. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=516.92s)]
*  They could no longer trust women to make decisions about their bodies. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=520.52s)]
*  They could no longer trust university officials to decide how to build their classes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=523.48s)]
*  And they could no longer trust the political system to decide fairly how to pick their [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=527.56s)]
*  representatives so they couldn't interfere with partisan gerrymandering. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=533.8s)]
*  Now they've decided that determining whether or not the law covers the president of the United [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=537.3199999999999s)]

*  And they have just cut a wide swath of the president's actions, powers, official and unofficial, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=548.04s)]
*  that they have deemed barred from criminal prosecution. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  It's stunning. And I hope people understand how significant this is, how much this day is one that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=559.0s)]
*  will be remembered as one that has very serious consequences for our understanding of the rule [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  of law in this country. We had better wake up and understand the consequences of this election [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=571.0s)]
*  and understand the consequences of having allowed a Supreme Court to have this kind of power in which [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=575.64s)]
*  they believe they cannot be checked by any level of government in our society and not trust the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=581.64s)]
*  American people to make decisions for themselves. I'm so alarmed. I'm so disturbed. But I would say [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=587.56s)]
*  I feel also a sense of resolve. I think they have fully shown themselves. This court has played its [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=594.28s)]
*  hand. Anyone pretending that we don't know what's going on with this court is doing that, is pretending. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=599.4799999999999s)]
*  I think we now have to get very serious about what it means. We are allowed to protect our democracy [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=605.88s)]
*  and we have to do so. We have to do so at the ballot box. And then once we prevail in elections, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=610.76s)]
*  we have to make real decisions about what we want to do to ensure the Supreme Court is ethical, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=615.56s)]
*  that the Supreme Court is acting in a way that is democratic. And we have to pass laws that will [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  close all of these loopholes that have been left open because we had the temerity to believe that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=625.4799999999999s)]
*  norms and ethics would guard us against certain kinds of conduct. That has not proven to be true [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=631.56s)]
*  and so we have a lot of work to do. And in the very near term, in four months, we will be [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=636.8399999999999s)]
*  making a decision about whether, about who should be in the Oval Office holding [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRVj--DvoP0&t=642.8399999999999s)]
