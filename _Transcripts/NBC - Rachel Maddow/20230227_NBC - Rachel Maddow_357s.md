# Officials look to establish baseline health indicators for residents near train wreck
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk)
*  If you own the mile-plus-long train that just crashed and created an epic, still-unspooling disaster [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=0.0s)]
*  with consequences that span multiple states and potentially multiple generations, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=7.2s)]
*  flowers, I'm sure, are nice. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=12.18s)]
*  But the question in East Palestine tonight is, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=14.08s)]
*  how much help is that community going to need, not just now, but for years to come? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=18.28s)]
*  And importantly, right now, who will get to decide that? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=23.78s)]
*  Who will set the appropriate monitoring and assistance in motion? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  Who makes sure things are put right now and for good? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=32.96s)]
*  Joining us now is Ohio U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=37.06s)]
*  He met today with people who live in and around East Palestine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=40.5s)]
*  He told people there today, quote, I am here for the long haul. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=43.5s)]
*  Senator Brown, I really appreciate you taking time to talk to us tonight. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  I know this is a really busy time for you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=49.46s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. It's wonderful to be back on your show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=52.94s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=54.88s)]
*  It's good to see you, too. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=55.720000000000006s)]
*  What do you think people should understand about the impact of this disaster [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=57.82s)]
*  and the impact on people in East Palestine that's maybe missing from the national coverage [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=63.1s)]
*  and the national discussion about this so far? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  What can you see from up close, from having been there just today, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=69.14s)]
*  that we might not be able to see from a national media point of view? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, your intro into the story was exactly right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=77.94s)]
*  It's what it's doing to people now. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=81.44s)]
*  We did a roundtable of sorts with 15, 20 local people, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=83.14s)]
*  some from the local foundation, city council, sheriff, commissioners, townspeople. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=87.86s)]
*  We did it a woman's woman owns a candle shop. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=97.14s)]
*  And I think three generations, her daughter is helping her run it now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  They four miles away from their shop, they own 40 or 50 beef cattle. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=103.28s)]
*  And what's that mean for them and people buying that? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  So there's all kinds of down the line. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=111.12s)]
*  You know, the water is safe. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=113.56s)]
*  The mayor says that the EPA says that they all are saying the water is safe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=115.68s)]
*  in the in the East Palestine water system. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=119.68s)]
*  But a lot of people have wells. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=123.18s)]
*  We don't know about beyond there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=125.2s)]
*  And we don't know, as you say, generation after generation, what this means. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=127.06s)]
*  So the reason I sat on there for the long haul is one, to make Norfolk Southern, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=131.36s)]
*  who, by the way, just announced billions of dollars in more stock options. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=135.96s)]
*  For their stockholders, especially their executives, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=141.32s)]
*  that's how they give them such extravagant pay. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  They were about to announce they announced that the day before, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=146.0s)]
*  said they were about to the day before the derailment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=148.6s)]
*  So we're holding them accountable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=151.16s)]
*  That's my biggest job. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=152.96s)]
*  But also, what do you do with the second generation and third generation? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=154.96s)]
*  So that's why I'm there for the long haul. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=158.44s)]
*  I was interested today to see a letter that you co-signed today [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=161.6s)]
*  with the junior senator from Ohio, the new senator, Republican J.D. Vance. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=166.76s)]
*  Now, you and Senator Vance obviously come from very different parts of the ideological number line. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=170.64s)]
*  And you're very different men and have very different approaches to things. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  But that makes it all the more interesting to see both your signatures on this letter [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=178.0s)]
*  to the EPA and the CDC saying, hey, we need to get out there right now and get a medical baseline. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=183.04s)]
*  Do voluntary collection of health indicators from people in this community [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  so that if there is a health impact over time, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=194.6s)]
*  we have baseline data that everybody agrees is good data that we can use [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=198.72s)]
*  so that any health problems in the long run can be incontrovertible. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=202.96s)]
*  I have to ask you about the substance of that request, if I have it correct, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=207.28s)]
*  and also what it's been like to to work with Senator Vance on this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=211.16s)]
*  I don't know Senator Vance well, but he's seeing the same things I'm seeing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=216.24s)]
*  He's talking to a lot of the same people I'm talking to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=219.6s)]
*  He realizes the severity and the seriousness of this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=222.8s)]
*  So we're teaming up, even though we don't know each other very well. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=226.16s)]
*  We are very different. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=229.24s)]
*  We have very different ideologies about government, the approach to government. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  But we both see this is really important. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  Bill Johnson, a local, very conservative Republican congressman, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=237.28s)]
*  represents most of the river counties. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=241.44s)]
*  He and I have teamed up on a number of things, too, on this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=243.36s)]
*  And, you know, Rachel, when you were talking, my mind goes on this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=246.12s)]
*  When you think about long term impact to a bill that Senator Chester and I wrote, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=250.24s)]
*  a bipartisan bill and passed what was called the PACT Act. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=255.04s)]
*  And those those soldiers, hundreds of thousands of our soldiers in Iraq [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=258.24s)]
*  and Afghanistan were exposed to these football field size burn pits [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=261.8s)]
*  in those countries and are beginning to develop all kinds of illnesses. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=266.24s)]
*  We listed 23 illnesses based on medical assistance and medical advice, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=270.24s)]
*  cancers and bronchial illnesses that could come from those burn pits. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=276.68s)]
*  And we're kind of approaching this the same way. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=281.2s)]
*  These can be two years, five years, 10 years down the line. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=283.28s)]
*  And we want to make sure that we've covered those things. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  So I bring sort of that experience of the PACT Act as a member [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  of the Veterans Committee to this and figuring out how do we look at this long term? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, it is really good to see you, Senator. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=298.88s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  Come back to the show soon. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=303.0s)]
*  Keep us updated on the situation in East Palestine [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=305.2s)]
*  and have your office keep us surprised as to what's being done at a concrete level. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  We want to keep it on the air, sir. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=311.36s)]
*  For sure. And I thank you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm planning on another trip in March. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  I they're going to see me a lot there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=317.16s)]
*  And I've got a really good relationship with the mayor and the sheriff [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  and someone consul and some citizens. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  And we'll keep talking by phone and then I keep showing up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=323.88s)]
*  So that's really important that they know somebody's on their side on this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's just my mission and my job. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=331.36s)]
*  Thank you. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=334.6s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZL1_7Y6tDk&t=336.72s)]
