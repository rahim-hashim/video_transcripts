# January 6 Committee Documents Suggest Meadows Involvement In Fake Elector Scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE)
*  By the end of this week, it will be a month exactly since Congress sent to the U.S. Justice Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=0.0s)]
*  a criminal referral recommending federal prosecution of Trump's White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  They are recommending that he be prosecuted for criminal contempt for his refusal to comply with compulsory measures, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=11.0s)]
*  including the subpoenas that he's received from the January 6 investigation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Now, the January 6 investigation and then the full House recommended prosecution for the same reason. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=22.16s)]
*  For Steve Bannon, Trump advisor Steve Bannon, when he defied subpoenas to testify. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  Now, in the Bannon case, it took the U.S. Justice Department just three weeks after they got the referral for him [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=35.64s)]
*  to actually decide that they were going to prosecute him and to obtain the indictment that they obtained against him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=41.12s)]
*  It took three weeks with Bannon. It's been longer than that already for Meadows. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=46.08s)]
*  It's been longer than that already that the U.S. Justice Department, the federal prosecutor's office in D.C. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=51.76s)]
*  has been considering this referral to prosecute Trump's White House Chief of Staff for the same thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=56.0s)]
*  Again, it'll be a month even by the end of this this week. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=61.52s)]
*  But so far, we've heard nothing about what the Justice Department is going to do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=65.28s)]
*  And the reason I say that is increasingly on my mind is because for the last few days here, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=70.08s)]
*  we have been reporting on emerging evidence that in not one, not two, not three, not four, but five, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=76.56s)]
*  in at least five different states, Republicans appear to have forged fake documents [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=84.0s)]
*  purporting to be the electoral slates from these five states. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=89.76s)]
*  They put themselves forward officially as if they were the real duly elected electors to the electoral college from their states, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=94.8s)]
*  when they in fact were not in each of these five states. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  It was Joe Biden who won the election. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  So those states sent Biden electors to cast the state's votes in the electoral college. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=106.56s)]
*  But nevertheless, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, at least Republicans filed fake documents [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  claiming that those states had actually picked Trump electors who were going to cast the state's electoral college votes for Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=119.72000000000001s)]
*  In the last few days here, thanks to reporting from Nicholas Wu at Politico.com and thanks to public records requests [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=127.92000000000002s)]
*  filed by the Watchdog Group American Oversight, we have been able to obtain and show you all five of those forged documents [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=133.0s)]
*  from Republicans in those five states. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=139.96s)]
*  Crucially, what we've noticed is that this doesn't seem to have been an instance in which five disparate groups of people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=142.08s)]
*  in five different states all had the same forgery idea coincidentally at the same time, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=148.84s)]
*  and they just independently all happened to do the same thing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=153.36s)]
*  If you actually look at the false documents that these five states or that Republicans in these five states sent into Congress [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=156.36s)]
*  and sent into the National Archives, the documents match each other exactly. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=162.36s)]
*  Same font, same spacing, same exact wording. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  Because of that, I mean, maybe it all proved to be a coincidence, but it does appear to have been a coordinated effort. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  At the very least, it appears that somebody distributed a template to Republicans in these five states and potentially beyond, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  telling them that this is how they should create these forged documents. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=186.88s)]
*  Well, the whole reason we're on to any of this is because it appears that this is something that the January 6th investigation is looking into. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=190.64s)]
*  We're sort of reverse engineering one of their lines of inquiry as best we can. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=197.64s)]
*  But as such, look at the Mark Meadows connection. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, what I'm about to show you, this doesn't say that the effort to coordinate these forgeries in five states came from the Trump White House. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=208.56s)]
*  But if you look at the contempt report that the January 6th investigation created about Mark Meadows, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=217.6s)]
*  it does seem to indicate that when he was serving as White House chief of staff, he was somehow involved in this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=224.72s)]
*  This is from the contempt referral on Mark Meadows. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=231.04s)]
*  Quote, the select committee seeks information from Mr. Meadows about issues, including the following quote, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Meadows received text messages and emails regarding apparent efforts to encourage Republican legislators to vote. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=239.04s)]
*  And to encourage Republican legislators in certain states to send alternate slates of electors to Congress. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=246.44s)]
*  A plan which one member of Congress acknowledged was, quote, highly controversial and to which Mr. Meadows responded, quote, I love it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Meadows responded to a similar message by saying we are and another such message by saying, quote, yes, have a team on it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=261.96s)]
*  This is also from the letter the January 6th investigation sent to Mark Meadows' lawyer about a month ago now when they were fighting with him about his cooperation just before he was referred for prosecution to the Justice Department. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=272.0s)]
*  That letter told Mr. Meadows' lawyer this quote, Mr. Meadows has also produced documents you apparently agree are relevant and not protected by any privilege at all. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=284.04s)]
*  Those documents include a November 7th, 2020 email discussing the appointment of alternate slates of electors as part of a quote, direct and collateral attack after the election. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=292.4s)]
*  So, again, we have learned recently that one of the things these guys did to try to falsify the election results and keep Trump in power and prevent the newly elected president from assuming office. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  One of the things they did was that they got Republicans in multiple states to create and file forged paperwork pretending to be the real electors from states that actually Biden won. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=320.96s)]
*  We believe now that we've seen the documents from five of the states and they all match almost exactly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=334.44s)]
*  We surmise based on that that this must have been some kind of a coordinated effort that somebody gave all these Republicans and all these states a template for how to do it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=338.96s)]
*  In so doing, incidentally, all those Republicans and all those states who signed their names to these forged documents, they may have opened themselves individually to potential forgery charges or other charges related to falsifying election related documents, which is a state crime in every state in the union and is a federal crime as well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=347.72s)]
*  We know from the January 6 investigation that Trump's White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was apparently involved in multiple communications about such an effort that he said he had a team on it, that we're doing it, that he loved it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=366.56s)]
*  And we know that the Justice Department is currently weighing the possibility of a criminal prosecution against him. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=382.0s)]
*  In part over his refusal to talk about exactly that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=388.12s)]
*  Other than that, how was your day? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkRMEHu-FFE&t=391.2s)]
