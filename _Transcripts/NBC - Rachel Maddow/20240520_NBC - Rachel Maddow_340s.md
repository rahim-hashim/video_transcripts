# Fani Willis blasts 'clown' Jim Jordan and MAGA followers for trying to interfere in Trump case
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk)
*  A man has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly threatening Fulton County [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=0.0s)]
*  District Attorney Fonny Willis. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=4.72s)]
*  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia says the man railed against [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=6.76s)]
*  D.A. Willis' prosecution of former President Donald Trump in YouTube live streams. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=11.24s)]
*  At one point, he's accused of saying D.A. Willis will, quote, be killed like a dog. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=16.68s)]
*  He's set to be formally arraigned in Atlanta next month. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=21.84s)]
*  The man indicted earlier this month is the second person to face federal criminal charges [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=26.08s)]
*  for threatening to kill Fulton County D.A. Fonny Willis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  The first was a man from Alabama. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=33.68s)]
*  Together, they represent a small fraction of the threats that Fonny Willis has received [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=35.64s)]
*  in the nine months since she began prosecuting Donald Trump and in the couple of years since [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=40.16s)]
*  she first started investigating that matter. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=44.42s)]
*  She travels with bodyguards. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  She's been forced to leave her home. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=48.099999999999994s)]
*  All this while former President Trump continues to attack her relentlessly to his supporters. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=49.56s)]
*  And as Republicans at the county, state, and federal level do everything they can to undermine [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  and impugn and stymie her work and smear her personally. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=61.0s)]
*  This level of sustained public attack is not usually the price of entry for doing your [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=65.58s)]
*  job as a district attorney, nor should it be in a country where the rule of law is supposedly [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=69.62s)]
*  the rule. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=75.14s)]
*  The ability of prosecutors and judges to do their jobs without fear is a fundamental test [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=76.82s)]
*  of our democracy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=81.66s)]
*  Whether you like the Georgia criminal case against former President Trump or not, Fonny [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=83.78s)]
*  Willis is one of the bellwethers for the rule of law in this country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=87.38000000000001s)]
*  Back with us now is the Fulton County District Attorney, Ms. Willis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=91.30000000000001s)]
*  Ms. Willis, I was interested to see in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution today there were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=95.06s)]
*  three Democratic state senators who published an opinion piece saying, quote, we are witnessing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=100.14000000000001s)]
*  a concerted effort by Trump and MAGA Republican politicians to cast doubt on the legitimate [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=105.94000000000001s)]
*  and strong Fulton County election interference case by attacking the prosecutor. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=111.06s)]
*  It's an effort that takes advantage of every avenue of government power to which Trump's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=116.14s)]
*  allies have access. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=119.86s)]
*  Their goal, delay accountability for Trump's alleged attempt to illegally overturn a presidential [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=121.26s)]
*  election. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  This strikes me very close to my heart because I feel like this is one of the first times [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=128.26s)]
*  I've seen people standing up for you on this point. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  Wanted to ask how it strikes you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  Do you agree with their assessment of what's going on? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=138.78s)]
*  Well, as you know, let's start with the federal government and Jim Jordan. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=143.22s)]
*  Jim Jordan has time after time after time attacked my office with no legitimate purpose. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=150.46s)]
*  Anyone who knows Jim Jordan's history knows that he only has the purpose of trying to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=157.54s)]
*  interfere in a criminal investigation. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=162.7s)]
*  He has now turned his tricks to he's going to look at grant programs, which I invite [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=165.3s)]
*  him to do. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=170.10000000000002s)]
*  And we have complied with his subpoenas. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  But yet he continues his attacks to try to interfere in a criminal investigation while [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=173.18s)]
*  all while his jurisdiction has one of the worst crime rates, has poverty issues, and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  not one time has he used his position to try to investigate people who are attacking me [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  and attacking others legitimately doing their jobs, making him illegitimate in his position. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=193.62s)]
*  And it's disgusting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=199.86s)]
*  And so I bring that up at the federal level because now at the state level, they've decided [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  to follow this clown's lead and they want to now try to interfere in an investigation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=206.62s)]
*  And it's not legitimate either. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=214.46s)]
*  And so it shall fail and it's not going to go anywhere. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=216.22000000000003s)]
*  But they are trying to attack me at every level. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  As you know, today is an exciting day for me because I'm on a ballot tomorrow and I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=222.7s)]
*  have a Democratic challenger and I plan to win and win big tomorrow. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=226.7s)]
*  But I also have a Republican challenger coming up in November who's unqualified, been practicing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=230.73999999999998s)]
*  law for less than four years, has never practiced criminal law, but has already got PACs supporting [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=237.1s)]
*  her, already has the National Democratic Party, excuse me, the National Republican Party, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  as well as the local Republican Party supporting her. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=249.62s)]
*  And so I am thankful to those three Democrats who stood up for what is right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=252.86s)]
*  But I am at a point where I need Fulton County voters to get out and vote. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=257.66s)]
*  I need people around the country to support me big and small to say that we are going [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=262.5s)]
*  to be a country that still believes in the rule of law. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=267.96s)]
*  We are not going to allow people to be attacked while they do their job. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=271.52s)]
*  Having prosecutors that are free from interference and are allowed to just look at cases, look [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=277.1s)]
*  at the facts, and if people broke the law to bring charges, has to go on for us to live [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=282.86s)]
*  in a free society. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  The sad part, though, for all of them, Ms. Maddow, is it doesn't matter how many times [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  they attack me. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=295.12s)]
*  I am not going to be broken and I am going to still be standing here doing my job lawfully. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=296.12s)]
*  Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis, I know it's a very busy time with the Prime [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=303.3s)]
*  Erie tomorrow and with everything going on in your life and the slings and arrows that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=307.1s)]
*  you are dealing with. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=310.82s)]
*  Thank you for being willing to talk with me and my audience tonight about this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=311.82s)]
*  And good luck to you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=316.34s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=317.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiGyIZT1CZk&t=318.34s)]
