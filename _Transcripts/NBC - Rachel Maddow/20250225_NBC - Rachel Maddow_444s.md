# Democrats not immune from voter wrath as pressure to impede Trump mounts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM)
*  We have to take the gloves off [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Americans pushing Republicans really hard particularly when they try to defend Trump [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  But Americans also really pushing their Democratic members of Congress to do more to fight harder against this White House and what feels like a real [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=8.76s)]
*  crisis in Washington [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=15.74s)]
*  And that's the happening not just to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Democratic members of Congress you're learning about for the first time here because I'm showing you tape from their town hall [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=22.8s)]
*  It's happening to all the Democrats including the Democratic leader in Washington Hakeem Jeffries leader of the house [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=26.8s)]
*  This was outside his office in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday hundreds of people calling on him to be more aggressive toward this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=32.36s)]
*  White House to stand up [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=38.56s)]
*  Faster to stand up more firmly to fight harder against Trump and his top campaign donor [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=40.36s)]
*  It happened to leader Jeffries again the very next day in Oakland, California [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=45.72s)]
*  This was outside an event where congressman Jeffries was giving remarks hundreds of people gathered outside [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=50.16s)]
*  Demanding that he do more [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=55.44s)]
*  And I absolutely understand the sentiment sentiment, but what can he do? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  What does he believe is within his power? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=63.72s)]
*  Joining us now is the man himself Democratic leader in the house Hakeem Jeffries [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=66.92s)]
*  the case that you are making against Republican policies here is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=72.4s)]
*  one that I hear and is cogent and that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=76.6s)]
*  Plays to a greater or lesser extent I think all across this country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  The other thing that Americans are stressed out about though right now is that policy? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=84.88s)]
*  Doesn't feel like it's the main conversation right now [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=90.44s)]
*  It feels like we are in the middle of a ketamine fueled [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=93.28s)]
*  middle-of-the-night [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=98.24s)]
*  Autocratic power grab that is rendering Congress [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=99.96s)]
*  Irrelevant that's rendering policy irrelevant and that's rendering the rule of law an [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=103.52s)]
*  Afterthought if not a joke to those who are planning on staying in power [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=109.32s)]
*  Indefinitely without benefit of further elections. I mean it is not about I mean it is about a bad budget [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  That's one of the things you have to contend with but the fight here feels like it's on a different scale than the kinds of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=119.88s)]
*  Legislative point counterpoint stuff that I think Democrats and Republicans are used to fighting over and I think what? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=127.55999999999999s)]
*  Americans are sort of clamoring for is to hear from you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=133.12s)]
*  Personally as the senior Democrat in Washington in the house where the knit margins are so narrow [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  To hear from you that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=141.28s)]
*  You understand the scale of the threat and you have ideas about how to interrupt what feels like something [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=144.8s)]
*  That we have not experienced since the Civil War in terms of the threat to our Republic [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=151.56s)]
*  Well, certainly the case that we understand the scale of the threat that can't be doubted the CBC [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=156.36s)]
*  Which I'm a part of definitively understands the scale of the threat our communities have been under siege as you pointed out since before [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=161.4s)]
*  The Civil War I'm a direct descendant of those very communities [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  So we understand the struggle the history the strength of people like John Lewis, which we're going to channel. That's my experience [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  That's my personal experience. That's my family's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=180.52s)]
*  Experience and so we understand that and as a caucus, it's definitively the case that we understand it [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=184.56s)]
*  Listen, we we launched the rapid response task force and litigation working group [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=191.28s)]
*  It's going to be led by Jonah goose and of course a brilliant constitutional lawyer [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=196.76s)]
*  Jamie Raskin to be able to respond to and work with our allies like tish James and others in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=201.44s)]
*  Part of what we are responding to listen Elon Musk and Donald Trump [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=208.44s)]
*  They're flooding the zone in part to create distress to create a sense of invincibility and inevitability [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=212.64s)]
*  but the reality is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=220.52s)]
*  There have been more than 75 different lawsuits that have been filed by democracy reform groups civil rights reform [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  groups by attorney generals like tish James and others and we're winning in court they're losing more than 35 different [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=230.88s)]
*  unconstitutional and unlawful executive orders and administrative actions have been challenged and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=240.56s)]
*  They're not winning those cases in terms of the Trump administration [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=245.84s)]
*  They're losing over and over and over again, that's been a forceful [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=249.2s)]
*  Pushback and that of course will continue the congressional battles will continue and the mobilization in the communities [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  Will continue [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=263.84s)]
*  Does it help does it advance? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=265.88s)]
*  Democrats ability to stand up against Trump and what's happening in Washington to have people at these town halls to have people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=269.68s)]
*  protesting in various symbolic and important places either that represent the government or that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=278.16s)]
*  Represents some of the forces that are at work right now within our government [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=282.64s)]
*  Just people showing up and doing direct action peaceful nonviolent direct action to try to put steel in your spine among others [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=285.84s)]
*  Does it does it help or is it more of a hindrance to you? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=293.8s)]
*  Well, listen public sentiment is everything as Abraham Lincoln once said with it nothing can [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=298.0s)]
*  Fail without it. Nothing can succeed. I don't think anyone needs [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=303.56s)]
*  Additional steel put in their spine. Let's be clear about that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=307.16s)]
*  And I think you know the house Democrats under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi during the prior Trump administration [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=310.04s)]
*  Continuing to where we are at this moment are going to continue to push back [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=317.24s)]
*  forcefully using every tool available now [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=323.52s)]
*  I think it does help for instance that our House Republican colleagues are held accountable [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=327.54s)]
*  Rachel you appropriately mentioned we've got the narrowest majority that any party has had in the Congress since before [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  the Great Depression [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=342.73999999999995s)]
*  narrowest majority [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=344.34s)]
*  218 Republicans 215 Democrats the Democrats are holding together [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=346.9s)]
*  we're holding together for instance on this reckless Republican budget, which is a betrayal of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=351.9s)]
*  working-class Americans and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=357.17999999999995s)]
*  Cuts the Medicaid cuts the snap cuts the veterans benefits. That's not theoretical that hurts real people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=359.82s)]
*  That I represent and that every single member of the House Democratic caucus represents. That's not a theoretical fight. That's a real [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=367.58s)]
*  Fight, but here's the thing on any given issue like the budget. We only need three [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=376.06s)]
*  Not all 218 Republicans. We only need three [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=382.62s)]
*  To do the right thing for their constituents [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=387.34s)]
*  And so the activity that we've seen over the last few days of the last week or so [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=391.7s)]
*  I think is going to let the Republicans know that no one is going to remove the spotlight from them [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=396.05999999999995s)]
*  They shouldn't be able to escape accountability and as Democrats, we're going to make sure that they don't [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  Democratic leader in the house Hakeem Jeffries later Jeffries. It is a real honor to have you here [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=411.34s)]
*  I know that your time is valuable come back anytime. Sorry. I'd love to talk to you anytime you can stand it [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=416.38s)]
*  Thank you so much. Thank you so much [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A455tNgeYM&t=421.38s)]
