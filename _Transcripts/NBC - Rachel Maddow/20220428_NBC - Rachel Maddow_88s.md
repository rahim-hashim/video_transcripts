# Legendary Courtroom Artist Art Lien Heads Toward Retirement With Powerful Legacy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc)
*  If you've watched this show, you have seen the work of an artist, a courtroom sketch artist named Art Lien. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=0.0s)]
*  Federal courts don't allow cameras, so we have needed Art Lien to be able to visualize lots of the proceedings we've covered here over the years, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=6.0s)]
*  including lots of Trump-era favorites like Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, the Supreme Court justices themselves at work. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=13.0s)]
*  Arthur Lien started work as a court artist in 1976. He's an unparalleled talent in a very niche and very important part of public life. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=21.0s)]
*  He was the only courtroom artist allowed into the first military tribunals at Guantanamo. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=30.0s)]
*  In the early days of the pandemic, he adapted to virtual Supreme Court proceedings by getting lawyers to send him photos of themselves making their oral arguments. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=35.0s)]
*  He then turned those photos into sketches. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=43.0s)]
*  This sketch captures Stephen Breyer's last case as a Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=46.0s)]
*  It's also Art Lien's final sketch for the Supreme Court because he is also retiring at the end of the Supreme Court term. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=51.0s)]
*  He is retiring at the height of his powers. Art Lien, you have no idea how much we have depended on you all of these years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=58.0s)]
*  Happy retirement, Mr. Lien. Great respect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=65.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unIR8L_BXwc&t=75.0s)]
