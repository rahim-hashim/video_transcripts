# What Ukrainian Refugees Find As They Cross The Border Into Hungary
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY)
*  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees announced today that more than 2 million people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=0.0s)]
*  have fled Ukraine so far in search of safety from Russian attacks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=4.4s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are still trying to make their way out of the country [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  as the fighting intensifies. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=12.56s)]
*  So far, more than 190,000 have crossed the border to where I am, in Hungary. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=14.4s)]
*  Tonight, I'm standing at a refugee shelter set up at a border crossing point in Bergsiran, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=19.28s)]
*  Hungary. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=24.84s)]
*  It's just before 4 a.m. here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=25.84s)]
*  Most people are sleeping. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=27.5s)]
*  Earlier tonight, I was able to walk through a reception area where people who had recently [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=28.58s)]
*  crossed the border, including families with young children, arrived for food, shelter, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  and warmth for the night. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=36.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=38.3s)]
*  So this is the buffet, basically, the place where people who are staying here, people [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=39.3s)]
*  who have come over from Ukraine, can get a little bit of food. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=45.26s)]
*  There's an office in which they run this entire operation at the border out of. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  It's inside a little tent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=52.94s)]
*  You can see some people going in there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=53.94s)]
*  They get registered. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=55.42s)]
*  Their needs are determined. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=58.02s)]
*  Even on the wall of the buffet here, you can see train lines. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=59.7s)]
*  There are routes that indicate where we are and where you can go in Hungary or in Europe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=62.7s)]
*  Now, when the refugees get here, there's a waiting room over here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  And I don't really want to go in right now because it's quite late at night. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  There are children sleeping in there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=75.62s)]
*  But it's a warm space in which people can rest. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=77.18s)]
*  There are beds, twin beds, that are out there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=80.7s)]
*  There are some people who are lying across several chairs that have been put together. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=83.22s)]
*  And then over here are sort of containers that have been made into sleeping spaces. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=87.06s)]
*  These are places where people can rest. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=93.92s)]
*  It's clean. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=95.78s)]
*  It's warm. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=96.78s)]
*  It's a very cold night. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=97.78s)]
*  It's about 26, 27 degrees right now, probably getting colder over the night. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=99.12s)]
*  So that's what this reception center is. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  It's a help center. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=107.76s)]
*  It's a reception center. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=108.76s)]
*  It's not built for people to be staying here for any length of time, but it is meant to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=109.76s)]
*  receive people who are coming over the Hungarian border from Ukraine who then are going to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=113.38s)]
*  go somewhere else. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=118.3s)]
*  In some cases, it's Budapest. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=119.3s)]
*  In some cases, it's other points in both Eastern and Western Europe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=120.3s)]
*  But this is typical of the help centers that are available at the crossings from Ukraine [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=124.1s)]
*  over into countries, either NATO countries like Hungary or other Eastern European countries [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=129.62s)]
*  that are not NATO, but that are a refuge for Ukrainians who need to get out of their country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=135.34s)]
*  This is not a natural disaster. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=143.62s)]
*  None of this needs to be happening. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=145.34s)]
*  It's a tragedy whose purpose is hard to process, that human beings still cause each other this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=146.94s)]
*  kind of suffering in 2022. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEk26dZ_1vY&t=151.34s)]
