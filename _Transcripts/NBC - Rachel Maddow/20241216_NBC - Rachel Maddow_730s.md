# Better for the billionaire: Rachel Maddow on the fallout when the presidency caters to billionaires
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk)
*  So speaking of holidays, two years ago on Thanksgiving Day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=0.0s)]
*  so Thanksgiving Day 2022, the leader of one of the world's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=5.4s)]
*  highest profile car companies made a surprise Thanksgiving [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  Day announcement. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=14.6s)]
*  He told people who owned his company's cars that as of that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=15.8s)]
*  day, they no longer had to drive their cars. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=21.8s)]
*  Starting that day, Thanksgiving Day, the cars would be able [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  to drive themselves from here on out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=29.9s)]
*  Quote, Tesla full self-driving beta is now available to anyone [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=33.1s)]
*  in North America who requests it from their car screen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=39.1s)]
*  Assuming you have bought this option. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=43.4s)]
*  Congratulations to Tesla autopilot slash AI team on [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=45.1s)]
*  achieving a major milestone. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=49.4s)]
*  So this is two years ago again, 2022 Thanksgiving Day, not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=53.4s)]
*  really any warning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=57.099999999999994s)]
*  This was coming in, just coming just hey, hey, if you if you [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=58.0s)]
*  bought a Tesla when you you have the option when you when [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=61.699999999999996s)]
*  you bought it to pay a little bit extra, so it would be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=65.1s)]
*  capable of driving itself someday. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=67.9s)]
*  If that day ever came all that day has come. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=70.6s)]
*  Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=73.0s)]
*  It was Thanksgiving Day. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=75.6s)]
*  The company CEO put out that announcement within a few hours. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=76.6s)]
*  It had led to some news. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=80.6s)]
*  Now with 516 people including eight kids were part of a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=83.0s)]
*  multi-car crash on the Bay Bridge causing some major [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=87.2s)]
*  traffic tie-ups. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=90.4s)]
*  They say it happened so fast a chain reaction crash eastbound [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=91.6s)]
*  on the Bay Bridge and inside the Yerba Buena Tunnel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=96.1s)]
*  I thought I was a goner at first when it happened. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=99.3s)]
*  I mean you see something like that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=101.9s)]
*  It's like coming towards you at full speed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=103.2s)]
*  I thought well, this is it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=105.4s)]
*  That was Thanksgiving Day 2022. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=107.2s)]
*  Just a few months later the news outlet The Intercept [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=110.8s)]
*  obtained video that showed that accident as it happened. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  It turns out it was a Tesla whose owner says the car was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=120.0s)]
*  in full self-driving mode and the car just randomly [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=123.1s)]
*  braked super hard in the middle of the tunnel, which is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  what started that huge pileup of cars in the tunnel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=131.3s)]
*  The one that injured all those people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=135.1s)]
*  Until today, we only saw the aftermath of the chain reaction [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=137.8s)]
*  crash last Thanksgiving Day drive by video of cars stacked [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=142.9s)]
*  up in the Yerba Buena Tunnel eastbound on the Bay Bridge and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  a traffic jam that lasted hours, but Bay Bridge surveillance [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=151.0s)]
*  video now shows how it started. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=155.3s)]
*  A 76 year old lawyer from San Francisco told the CHP his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=157.3s)]
*  white 2021 Tesla Model S was in full self-driving mode when [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=161.70000000000002s)]
*  it suddenly deployed the brakes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=166.7s)]
*  A total of eight vehicles crashed, nine people injured, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  including a two-year-old boy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=172.0s)]
*  Just hours before the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  the launch of the full self-driving beta version, which [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=178.2s)]
*  he called a major milestone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=181.2s)]
*  But there are a growing number of reports of the Tesla [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=183.0s)]
*  technology unexpectedly slamming on the brakes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=186.2s)]
*  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration assigned [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=189.5s)]
*  a special crash investigation team to look into what happened. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  They're already investigating dozens of incidents involving [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=195.4s)]
*  advanced driver assistance systems from Volvos, Cadillacs, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=198.6s)]
*  Hyundai, Genesis and Cruze, but mostly Tesla. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=202.5s)]
*  Mostly Teslas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=205.5s)]
*  And you know, car crashes happen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=207.5s)]
*  We humans aren't all that great at avoiding the problem of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=210.8s)]
*  hurting and killing ourselves and each other with our cars. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=214.8s)]
*  Car crashes are a plague. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=217.3s)]
*  And who among us can say whether robots might be better [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=219.6s)]
*  at driving than us overall, writ large? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=224.6s)]
*  But in a country with more than 280 million cars and trucks [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=227.4s)]
*  on the road, clearly it's worth studying if we're going to make [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=232.2s)]
*  this change, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=234.6s)]
*  It's worth studying whether letting robots drive our cars [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=235.3s)]
*  is going to be more or less safe than having us humans drive the cars. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=238.4s)]
*  Well, the U.S. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=242.6s)]
*  government is doing that studying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=244.8s)]
*  You saw a reference in that news report there to the National [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=246.5s)]
*  Highway Traffic Safety Administration looking at the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=249.7s)]
*  crash and looking into that particular crash and others like it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=254.4s)]
*  Well, the year before that big Thanksgiving Day crash in the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=257.6s)]
*  Bay Area, that government agency started a program where car [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=261.2s)]
*  companies have to report when crashes happen while a car has [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=266.2s)]
*  been in autopilot or in full self-driving mode. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=271.0s)]
*  They have to tell the government when that happens. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=274.0s)]
*  So that means crashes like that one that happened in the tunnel [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=276.8s)]
*  in 2022 in the San Francisco Bay Area, also from this other [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=280.0s)]
*  terrible crash that was right nearby in Contra Costa County in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=284.3s)]
*  California the following year. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=287.1s)]
*  This was a fire truck that got slammed into at speed by a Tesla [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  that was on autopilot. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=292.8s)]
*  The Tesla driver was killed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=293.8s)]
*  Four firefighters were sent to the hospital in that crash. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=295.5s)]
*  Earlier this year, the agency released its report on its [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=298.7s)]
*  findings after collecting all of this data for several years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  It led to headlines like this, quote, Tesla's autopilot and full [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=308.2s)]
*  self-driving linked to hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=312.4s)]
*  Government report described the data about these hundreds of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  crashes, but it also gave the specific details of some of them, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=323.79999999999995s)]
*  including one particularly harrowing one from North Carolina. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=326.9s)]
*  A 10th grader stepped off of a school bus. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=330.9s)]
*  School bus was doing everything right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=334.5s)]
*  It was pulled over. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  It had its lights flashing, had all the warning signals that a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=337.4s)]
*  school bus activates when it's letting off students to let [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=341.0s)]
*  everybody know around there that they need to stop school bus is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=343.5s)]
*  doing everything right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=346.7s)]
*  The kid was doing everything right, but a 2022 Model Y Tesla on [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=347.5s)]
*  autopilot mode nevertheless whipped around the stop school bus [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=351.9s)]
*  and slammed into this kid. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=356.29999999999995s)]
*  This 10th grader had to be medevac to the hospital with life-threatening [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  injuries. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=361.7s)]
*  By the time that government report was issued, not only had individual [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=364.2s)]
*  crashes like that received a lot of local attention in the areas [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=368.1s)]
*  where they happened, but the overall problem was starting to come [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=372.0s)]
*  into focus. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=377.0s)]
*  Reuters, for example, had already reported that criminal a criminal [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  investigation into these matters was underway targeting Tesla. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  Tesla had already disclosed in an SEC filing that it had received [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=386.5s)]
*  federal subpoenas for information about its full self-driving mode [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=390.5s)]
*  and its autopilot mode. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=394.3s)]
*  Then just a few weeks ago the government announced the opening of a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=397.5s)]
*  formal federal investigation of Tesla's full self-driving mode in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=401.6s)]
*  more than 2 million Tesla's more than 2 million cars. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=405.3s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=410.4s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=410.8s)]
*  But you might have noticed that I said that report happened a few [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=413.7s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=416.2s)]
*  To be specific that happened that the announcement of that federal [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=418.1s)]
*  investigation that big potentially very consequential federal [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=420.6s)]
*  investigation the announcement of that happened in mid-October. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=423.5s)]
*  What's happened between mid-October and now since then you might have [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=428.2s)]
*  seen that Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has basically had himself surgically [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=433.3s)]
*  attached to Donald Trump's body. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=438.8s)]
*  I mean, seriously are they stitched together can either one of them [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=440.7s)]
*  get dressed alone at this point? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=444.6s)]
*  And of course Donald Trump won the presidential election last month. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=447.7s)]
*  And so what happens now to anybody who is unsettled by the idea of a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=452.3s)]
*  robot-controlled car driving itself into a nearby fire engine full of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pznmBooVk&t=455.8s)]
