# 'The Republican Party is sick.': Maddow notes atypical nature of current House speaker vacancy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8)
*  So he was speaker of the House of Representatives and he was absolutely over it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He said, quote, as you all know, for something like three years and especially the last 19 [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  and a half months, I have been very closely tied to Washington. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=11.52s)]
*  Although I have enjoyed hugely being here with you, ladies and gentlemen, I do have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=15.52s)]
*  the very great desire for a few days sniffing a different atmosphere. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=20.64s)]
*  This is from the U.S. Speaker of the House at the time, Sam Rayburn, speaking on the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=28.12s)]
*  floor of Congress, August 1941. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=32.76s)]
*  I have a very great desire of sniffing a different atmosphere as opposed to yours, which I am [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=35.4s)]
*  sick of sniffing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=42.04s)]
*  He then just spelled it out even more plainly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  He said, quote, I am homesick. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=45.96s)]
*  I want to go home tomorrow. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=47.84s)]
*  And his colleagues in the House of Representatives let him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=51.96s)]
*  They allowed him to go home, to sniff home. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=55.16s)]
*  They voted in a temporary speaker, a speaker pro tem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=59.0s)]
*  So Mr. Rayburn could go back home for a few days and rest up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  It happens. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=67.44s)]
*  A quarter century later, 1966, similar situation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=68.44s)]
*  Speaker of the House at that time wanted to leave town for a few days. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=71.6s)]
*  He said he wanted to give a speech to the Massachusetts state legislature. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  He said he'd have to be away to go do that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=77.72s)]
*  So please vote in a temporary speaker in my absence to take care of business. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=81.28s)]
*  It was no big deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=85.72s)]
*  People apparently didn't even care that while he was home, supposedly to talk to the state [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=86.72s)]
*  legislature where he turned up in the papers was at the big Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=90.84s)]
*  in South E. So really what he meant to ask for was, hey, do you mind giving us a new [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=96.72s)]
*  speaker for a few days? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=102.12s)]
*  I want to go drink green beer in South Boston. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=103.36s)]
*  He didn't put it that way. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=106.36s)]
*  He asked for a different reason, but it was no big deal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=108.12s)]
*  It happens. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  1939, Speaker William Bankhead told his colleagues he needed a break because he was, quote, a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  little bit tired. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=117.56s)]
*  They said, OK. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=119.44s)]
*  In 1940, he told his fellow lawmakers that a case of the flu was holding him holding [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=120.44s)]
*  on to him, quote, with great tenacity and he needed a few days off to have the flu. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  And yes, for when he was tired and for when he had the flu, we got a temporary speaker [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=131.6s)]
*  of the House. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=135.72s)]
*  It is not uncommon, at least it's not unheard of, to have the U.S. House of Representatives [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=138.16s)]
*  elect a temporary speaker for any number of reasons, even sort of cute reasons, even slightly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=143.4s)]
*  disingenuous reasons about going to parades. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=149.48s)]
*  But now we're looking at a situation where we're getting a speaker pro tem, apparently [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=152.9s)]
*  indefinitely, not because the real speaker is sick, but because the Republican Party [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=157.64s)]
*  is sick and it has no sign of getting better anytime soon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kW3zTR82f8&t=163.08s)]
