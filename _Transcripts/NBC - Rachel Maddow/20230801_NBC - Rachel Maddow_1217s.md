# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 31
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU)
*  Joining us now is Tim Hafe. He's a former lead investigator for the congressional investigation into January 6. Mr. Hafe. Thank you for being with us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for the invitation Rachel [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=7.44s)]
*  So I just wanted to ask you about this this hanging thread [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=9.92s)]
*  From the january 6 investigation which does feel like it's got some resonance with what's going on now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=13.52s)]
*  I know the investigation made criminal referrals for trump for also john eastman [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=18.32s)]
*  That you encourage state bar associations to look further into some of the lawyers involved in this case [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=23.84s)]
*  Including the lawyer who was representing cassidy hutchinson. I know he sued the committee for suggesting that he tried to wrongly influence his client [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=28.64s)]
*  Can you just tell us sort of what became of all that how that all ended up? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, so you mentioned one thread. There are actually two threads that are significant here [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  The first thread is how the money was raised in the first place [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  So as the select committee showed rachel the trump campaign very quickly pivoted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=51.44s)]
*  To a massive fundraising operation essentially peddling [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=57.44s)]
*  Election lies stopped the steel became a cash machine and it raised about 250 million dollars between [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  The election and president biden's inauguration that money the vast majority of it went into [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=70.16s)]
*  The save america pack which we then saw over the course of our investigation as the entity [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=76.16s)]
*  That was paying the fees of witnesses before the select committee the people that gave money to say to this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  In this effort were told that it was going to the election defense fund that it was going to sort of you know fuel and pay for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=89.04s)]
*  Litigation or other efforts to to reverse the the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Result of the election it did not go to any such thing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=99.92s)]
*  There was no election defense fund instead it went to save america pack [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=103.28s)]
*  So the first thread here is essentially the the lies and the grift that the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=105.84s)]
*  Trump folks perpetuated to get the money and then the second thread is the one that you mentioned and that is that money then goes [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  to pay the legal fees [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=116.72s)]
*  Of more than a dozen witnesses not just cassidy hudgeson, but others [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=118.4s)]
*  a lot of those witnesses [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=123.68s)]
*  Uh did not remember very salient things very important conversations that others said they were present for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=125.44s)]
*  Only cassidy really suggested directly that she was coached to lie, you know, she indicated that her first [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  trump funded lawyer [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=141.04s)]
*  Essentially encouraged her to hold information back and said you don't need to tell them about that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  They don't know what you don't know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=147.92s)]
*  But we had the suspicion and we articulate this in our report that a lot of the trump funded lawyers essentially were coaching witnesses [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=149.84s)]
*  To to obscure key facts. So it is seems to be a pattern [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=156.8s)]
*  And it is one that that definitely impacted our investigation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Where we start tonight is now in our current day in the great state of minnesota [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=166.32s)]
*  Where a reporter for the conservative national review magazine recently wrote quote for the price of a new xbox game [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=173.04s)]
*  You too can own your very own state party [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=180.56s)]
*  And it turns out that is sort of true [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=185.92s)]
*  Madden nfl 23 for xbox one is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=188.55999999999997s)]
*  $59.99 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  The game farming simulator 22. That's an xbox game that one costs 49.99 [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=194.0s)]
*  Star wars jedi survivor is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=200.32s)]
*  $52.49 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  If you are willing and able to shell out that kind of money roughly for an xbox xbox game, let me tell you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=206.56s)]
*  National review is right [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=213.28s)]
*  You are right in the ballpark for what it would take to buy out [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=214.64s)]
*  All the cash assets of the republican party of the great state of minnesota [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=218.88s)]
*  The state republican party in minnesota recently reported that its bank accounts are currently flush with a grand total of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  $53.81 [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  So that is a dollar 32 more than the star wars game costs [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=235.04s)]
*  but [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=240.96s)]
*  For farm simulator. It's actually a deal you could cash in all the cash assets of the minnesota republican party [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=242.48s)]
*  And with that money you could get the 49.99 [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=249.2s)]
*  farming simulator game plus almost [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  $4 change which means you in addition to that xbox farming simulator [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=255.66s)]
*  You could buy some cheetos not the big bag of cheetos not party size, but a pretty good size one [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=259.68s)]
*  Especially if it were on sale [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=264.0s)]
*  Why does the republican party of the state of minnesota have less than [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=267.2s)]
*  60 dollars in its bank account [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  I do not know [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  Um, but the daily beast was first to report it and the details actually only get worse from there [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=277.76s)]
*  In addition to having less than 60 bucks to its name the republican party of minnesota also reportedly has over [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  330,000 in debt [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=291.58s)]
*  Which it needs to pay off which it will not be able to pay off with less than 60 bucks cash in its bank account [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  So that does not seem good [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=299.36s)]
*  It also it turns out is not an isolated story [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  The same sort of thing or at least a variation on this sort of thing is happening in a whole bunch [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=303.92s)]
*  Of key states for republicans right now in colorado for example [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=309.2s)]
*  The colorado's son was first to report that that state's republican party was so broke [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=313.04s)]
*  That it has stopped paying its employees [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=319.04s)]
*  And that it is unable to pay rent on its office space [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=322.16s)]
*  The deputy chief of the republic excuse me of the colorado house republican party told the colorado son [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  That the colorado state republican party very simply is bankrupt [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, I don't know if there's a connection [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  But I should also tell you that the colorado republican party is planning to vote next week to simply cancel [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  the 2024 republican primary in colorado [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=346.88s)]
*  If you don't have enough money to pay your rent or your staffers and your bankrupt [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=351.2s)]
*  I guess something's got to go. Why not your basic function as a party? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=354.56s)]
*  In arizona [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  The messenger news outlet was first to report that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  Arizona's state republican party reported in its federal election filings that it has only about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=366.94s)]
*  $23,000 in the bank in total and that might be enough to trade for a new hunday elantra [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=374.06s)]
*  But only as long as you don't want one with cruise control [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=379.44s)]
*  For all the trouble with the Arizona republican party being that broke [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  I should tell you that the party's highest profile trump supporting election denier politician [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=387.7s)]
*  Arizona republican party's failed gubernatorial candidate kerry lake [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=393.54s)]
*  She's heading soon to another state to michigan to help michigan's republican party raise some money [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  You'd think that she might be able to help out at home [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=404.1s)]
*  But no she's going to michigan to help them raise money that was just reported today by the detroit news [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=406.02000000000004s)]
*  That said maybe it's needed help even with arizona being as broke as it is look in michigan. They got trouble, too [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=410.82s)]
*  The michigan state republican party is broke as well. They reported [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=418.34s)]
*  $93,000 total in their bank accounts [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=422.32s)]
*  And that comes in michigan as 16 michigan republicans including the former former state party co-chair [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=426.02s)]
*  Are now facing multiple felony charges for having submitted themselves as four days in a row [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=432.74s)]
*  Submitted themselves as forged electors as michigan electors in the presidential race in 2020 [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=439.38s)]
*  Even though they really weren't because joe biden won that state not donald trump [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=445.06s)]
*  We don't yet know if other people who participated in the fake electors scheme for trump in other states [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=451.14s)]
*  Are going to be charged as well the way they've been charged in michigan [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=457.06s)]
*  But george is one of the states where that is a possibility in georgia [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=460.98s)]
*  We know that a bunch of republicans who participated in the fake electors scheme [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=464.34s)]
*  They receive target letters from the prosecutor's office in that state fanny willis's office as she investigates [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=469.38s)]
*  Various efforts to throw out georgia's election results and falsely proclaim trump the winner [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=475.7s)]
*  The atlanta journal constitution was first to report that this is also turning out to be an expensive prospect for the state republican party in georgia [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=480.9s)]
*  georgia state republican party [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=489.54s)]
*  Agreed to pay the legal bills for those fake electors and in so doing [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=491.7s)]
*  Georgia state republican party saddled themselves with a remarkable financial burden already in the first half of this year the party spent like [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=495.85999999999996s)]
*  over a half million dollars on this [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=504.5s)]
*  It spent five times what it spent on all the party's annual legal expenses combined as recently as 2021 [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=506.9s)]
*  And we're only halfway through the year thus far [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=514.66s)]
*  In the first half of 2023 they've spent five times what they spent [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  On all legal expenses for everything as recently as 2021 and that was for the whole year [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  That's a lot of states with a lot of financial drama and these are not state republican parties in like [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=530.66s)]
*  Forgive me sort of you know obscure states where things are never going to be contested [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=536.82s)]
*  I mean minnesota [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=541.94s)]
*  colorado [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=543.52s)]
*  Arizona michigan georgia that's like the table of contents for places republicans want to show what they can do in this next election cycle [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  And the one after that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=552.18s)]
*  But all all of them in all those states they're broke or they're spending themselves into oblivion [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=554.82s)]
*  I started by saying that the the national review compared the assets of the minnesota state republican party to the price of a single [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=561.62s)]
*  xbox game [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=568.64s)]
*  That same conservative publication recently looked at this dire financial picture in multiple states and said this [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=570.5s)]
*  I said quote if republicans are disappointed with the results of the 2024 elections for the fourth straight cycle mind you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=577.46s)]
*  A key factor will be the replacement of competent boring regular state party officials [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=585.0600000000001s)]

*  Successfully managing a state party or the basic blocking and tackling involved in helping gop candidates win elections [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=596.72s)]
*  Quite exciting blustering nut jobs couldn't have said it better myself [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=603.5400000000001s)]
*  But that's where we are [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=609.78s)]
*  With the state republican parties in five more or less crucial states either in dire financial straits or with crippling financial [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=612.58s)]
*  Commitments to people charged with trump related crimes or just outright bankrupt [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=619.86s)]
*  We've got a republican presidential primary that mathematically isn't even worth watching let alone polling at this point at a california state [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=624.02s)]
*  Republican party meeting this weekend the la times reports that police had to be called in to avert fistfights between two different republican factions [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=631.94s)]
*  What's adorable about this story is the nature of the fight at the behest of the trump campaign the california republican party [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=640.5s)]
*  Tried to change the rules of its presidential primary [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=647.46s)]
*  to benefit trump [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=651.38s)]
*  Trump's campaign basically told the california republican party to change the change the rules of its primary [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=654.34s)]
*  So that trump would be all but guaranteed to get every single one of the delegates out of california [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=660.74s)]
*  The california republican party asked to do this by the trump campaign said yes, sir. Absolutely. How high [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=666.3399999999999s)]
*  But some of the even more radical trump supporters in that party convinced themselves that in the various scheme must be afoot to trick them [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=672.5s)]
*  That of course, that's what they want you to think and so they you know put on their tinfoil hats and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=680.42s)]
*  Made their little signs about the illuminati or whatever and marched on the meeting [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=686.42s)]
*  And fights broke out and the cops had to be called to break it up [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=691.54s)]
*  What was it the national review said [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=698.1s)]
*  quite exciting blustering net jobs [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=700.66s)]
*  So depending on where you are in the country [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=703.9399999999999s)]
*  If you're a republican, this is your republican party [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=707.3s)]
*  Party financial assets equal to one perhaps discounted mid-level xbox game in one key state [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=710.02s)]
*  Fist fights among the republican faithful in another state only because they are so q anon addled [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=715.94s)]
*  They cannot even understand when they are getting what they want a biden economy that everyone begrudgingly admits [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=721.0600000000001s)]
*  Is working for everyone even if no one's willing to credit joe biden for it [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=728.1800000000001s)]
*  And an accused felon promising to destroy the country as the only challenger [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=732.26s)]
*  They're able to put forward to run against president biden [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=736.98s)]
*  Morning consult recently did a public approval [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=743.78s)]
*  poll [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=746.74s)]
*  Um in all 50 states and it was public approval polling in all 50 states about the governors of all 50 states [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=747.7s)]
*  And this generated a bunch of local headlines state headlines that you'd expect most of those headlines were about like [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=756.82s)]
*  You know the relative standing of the most and least popular governors in the country and [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=762.6600000000001s)]
*  For governors who are up for reelection this morning consult polling helped [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=767.94s)]
*  various local publications get a handle on whether the that governor's approval rating was going up or going down with voters as they [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=772.34s)]
*  You know head toward trying to hold on to their seat next year that kind of local interest in state interest [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=778.9000000000001s)]
*  Here's my interest though [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=784.1s)]
*  Look at this stuff overall however interested you might be in who's slightly more or less popular among the governors [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=786.26s)]
*  There is one big overarching story here [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  which is that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=796.26s)]
*  All of the governors are popular [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=797.94s)]
*  All of them in all 50 states [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=800.9s)]
*  There is not a single governor in any state in the country right now who has a higher disapproval than approval rating [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=803.14s)]
*  Not a single governor in the entire country is underwater [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=810.58s)]
*  They're all more positively viewed by their constituents than they are negatively viewed [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=813.86s)]
*  And again, you can maybe tell a story of local interest about any one governor who finds himself or herself in that position [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=820.82s)]
*  But when it's all 50 governors who are in that position, that's a bigger story [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=827.38s)]
*  That's a national story hiding in plain sight [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=832.18s)]
*  which is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=835.46s)]
*  that americans [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=837.22s)]
*  Broadly are not that unhappy with how things are being run right now [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=838.58s)]
*  And yes, you ask people about national political figures and national political institutions and americans say like [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=844.9000000000001s)]
*  Basically broadly americans say oh, yeah, I hate them. I hate the congress. I hate the supreme court [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=853.7s)]
*  I don't like the president and honestly americans unless they're kind of culty about it [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=858.6600000000001s)]
*  They don't really like any of the other presidential candidates who want to run against the president either [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=863.22s)]
*  So if you ask about like how things are going governance wise nationally people are like, oh, i'm sure that things are absolutely terrible [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=868.58s)]
*  But if you ask americans about something that doesn't really have national political conversation around it if you ask [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=874.9000000000001s)]
*  Hey, how are things actually running? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=880.74s)]
*  Government wise as you see it [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=883.2800000000001s)]
*  More or less the answer in every state in the country is yeah things are okay [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=887.38s)]
*  Everybody's pretty happy everybody's at least more happy than not [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=892.82s)]
*  In all 50 states [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=897.3s)]
*  Every single governor in the country is above water [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=900.9s)]
*  And if you put a political science lens on that [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=904.02s)]
*  So that you stop trying to parse that in terms of the individual performance of each of those 50 governors [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=906.9799999999999s)]
*  If you put a political science lens on that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=911.86s)]
*  I mean it basically means if you strip away [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  nationalized partisan political combat and nationalized partisan tribalism [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=917.68s)]
*  The fundamentals in the country as viewed by the american people are pretty good [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  And the fundamentals are almost always about the economy [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=928.36s)]
*  So yeah, you look at that chart of every governor in america being above water [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=933.32s)]
*  Maybe what that has something to do with is the beating all expectations economic growth [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=938.2s)]
*  And personal income rising and inflation flattening out and an infrastructure surge and record job growth [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  And the lowest sustained unemployment we have had in decades [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=951.32s)]
*  And no one apparently wants to credit joe biden and the biden administration for that [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=956.2800000000001s)]
*  So they credit their governor [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=962.2s)]
*  They credit the governor in each of the 50 states [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=964.84s)]
*  But that's okay, you know we can read we know basic political science [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=972.0400000000001s)]
*  We also know basic polling [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  Where if the country really was over president joe biden and really wanted him out of there and everybody was really ready for somebody new [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=979.4799999999999s)]
*  Then the opposing party republicans would be falling all over themselves to ride that train [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=986.92s)]
*  Right to become one of the immensely popular candidates ready to take on this unpopular president joe biden [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=992.5999999999999s)]
*  Who everybody agrees is doing such a bad job, right? That is not what's happening [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=999.56s)]
*  So here's an update for you sort of a provocative one [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1004.5999999999999s)]
*  You may remember that earlier this year in a country called uganda [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1007.4s)]
*  They passed a kill the gays law a law that among other things imposes the death penalty for something called aggravated homosexuality [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1011.88s)]
*  When that was signed the biden administration said they were revolted. They very forcefully came out against it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  They said the white house would reevaluate the way the u.s engages with that country because of it [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1026.12s)]
*  Well the big high dollar way that our country engages with them [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1031.32s)]
*  Is a universally respected american program called pepfar. It's a huge sustained initiative to fight aids [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  And save lives is one of the unilaterally [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1043.24s)]
*  Uncomplicated good things the united states has ever done in africa pepfar absolutely works [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1045.86s)]
*  But in may in light of the new [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1052.52s)]
*  Law with the death penalty for being gay the biden administration said it would reassess its funding of that program [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1055.24s)]
*  It has not played out that way so far the white house has made no changes [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1062.68s)]
*  A senior administration official told nbc news last week that for now the program will continue as is [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  That the administration will quote reassess on an ongoing basis [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1071.96s)]
*  The ability to deliver the pepfar funding and how but again no changes for now [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1076.3600000000001s)]
*  Now the people who support pepfar the people who have been champions of it many of whom also work with african human rights groups [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1082.6000000000001s)]
*  They're calling on the biden administration [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1088.84s)]
*  To change things to change the way they provide this funding [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1091.0s)]
*  This is hundreds of millions of dollars in this one program each year. It's a ton of money [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1094.1999999999998s)]
*  And if nothing changes that funding will go specifically to officials who have led and championed this new law [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1100.76s)]
*  Which promotes the extermination of gay people in africa? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1107.4799999999998s)]
*  Which is which the biden administration has says has said it is furious about [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1110.84s)]
*  This also comes at a time when this may spread beyond beyond uganda [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1116.04s)]
*  Kenya and gana and tanzania and a number of other african countries are looking to adopt similar kill the gays laws [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  targeting their country's lgbtq citizens [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1127.32s)]
*  The other context here is that uganda has tried something like this before they passed legislation similar to this in 2014 [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1131.48s)]
*  It was met with massive resistance within the country itself [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1137.6399999999999s)]
*  But also from the obama administration at the time and under pressure from the obama administration at the time [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1141.64s)]
*  uganda back in 2014 back down [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1148.04s)]
*  This time uganda is going ahead and they think the biden administration is going to let them and that they're going to keep getting [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1151.3200000000002s)]
*  All the assistance they've ever had from the united states with no changes and no strings attached [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1157.16s)]
*  The biden administration said it would reassess this relationship [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1162.68s)]
*  So far they're not [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1166.76s)]
*  What will the consequences be if any this time around will they keep their word? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1168.92s)]
*  Confounding situation here watch this space [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1174.58s)]
*  You [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X22DmleyogU&t=1198.76s)]
