# Republican Smear Operation Exposed In New Report
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk)
*  There's a website out there that you might have come across called bidennomz.com. When I first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=0.0s)]
*  found out there was this Biden Noms website, I of course thought it was about the snacks that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=6.48s)]
*  President Biden is nomming on. It was like an ice cream tribute site. But it's actually bidennomz.com [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=10.72s)]
*  is about Biden nominees for government posts. It's the website of a right-wing group called [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=16.96s)]
*  the American Accountability Foundation. And it's not shy about what the group is setting out to do. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=22.8s)]
*  They say at bidennomz.com, quote, personnel is policy. We are working to ensure that leaders [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  within the federal government reflect the values and concerns of the American people, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=34.08s)]
*  not the liberal coastal elites and their woke allies in corporate America. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=37.76s)]
*  And then just like they're sort of hunting trophies, the site has headshot after headshot [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=43.76s)]
*  of headshot after headshot of Biden nominees. Some of them famous ones for sure, but some of them [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=48.32s)]
*  you've definitely never heard of. The thing that's unique about this group is that they're not [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=53.44s)]
*  sort of trying to keep one person who they don't like or two people who they don't like out of the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=59.68s)]
*  job. They're trying to keep every single Biden nominee out of the job, or at least to dirty them [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=63.28s)]
*  all up along the way. Everybody Biden nominated who's going through the confirmation process, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=68.32s)]
*  they're going after them simply because Biden nominated them, all of them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=73.6s)]
*  Now, opposition research isn't new. It's a sort of gross part of how Washington operates, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=77.83999999999999s)]
*  but it has always been thus. This group, though, is different. An investigative reporter, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  Jane Mayer at the New Yorker has been busy sort of finding them out. Quote, the American [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Accountability Foundation's approach represents a new escalation in partisan warfare. Rather than [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  attack a single candidate or nominee, the group aims to thwart the entire Biden slate, meaning [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  every Biden nominee full stop. They claim to have successfully derailed nominations like Biden's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=106.8s)]
*  nominee for Comptroller of the Currency by ginning up a fake narrative that she was somehow a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=112.32s)]
*  communist, an actual communist. Also the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin for position at the Federal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=117.44s)]
*  Reserve Board. They claimed falsely that a delay in her disclosure of a stock trade was because she [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=123.28s)]
*  had somehow abused her position as a previous government employee to obtain some sort of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=130.0s)]
*  secret financial benefit for herself. It was completely false. There's mudslinging, but then [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=136.32s)]
*  there's this. What's different about this is the wholesale approach to every nominee of the Biden [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=143.6s)]
*  administration and the willingness to levy these attacks, not only sort of separate from the facts, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  but separate in many cases from common decency at a wholesale level. Joining us now is Jane Mayer. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=157.44s)]
*  She's chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. She's also the author of Dark Money, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=163.04s)]
*  The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right. Ms. Mayer, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=166.64s)]
*  it's a pleasure to have you here. Thank you for making time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=170.88s)]
*  Great to be with you. Welcome back. And that was a fantastic introduction. I had never heard the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  phrase, eliminationist rhetoric before, but it's perfect in describing what this group tries to do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=179.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=186.08s)]
*  Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say. But I mean, when I was watching the Judge Jackson [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=187.28s)]
*  confirmation hearings and Senator Hawley and Senator Blackburn and conservative media started [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  going down this line with her, it was shocking because the allegation they were making against [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=199.84s)]
*  her saying that she was, you know, soft on sexual abuse of children was so divorced from the facts [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  and was felt so wrong. But it also does dovetail with these other political tactics that we see in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=212.4s)]
*  dictatorships and that we sort of started to see in the Trump era, the Republican Party. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=218.4s)]
*  And it really had me wondering who cooked this up because I didn't think Josh Hawley made it up [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=221.68s)]
*  himself. It seems like you've discovered that this group was the origin story for that false attack. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=225.52s)]
*  Yeah, Hawley had some little helping hands. And it was this group, the American Accountability [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=232.56s)]
*  Foundation, which, believe it or not, is a tax exempt organization. You can give money to it and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=240.4s)]
*  get a tax deduction while it smears everybody in sight. And it does, you know, sort of phony [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=247.52s)]
*  research, basically, and a pretty sloppy job if you really look into it. Most of the mud that it's slunk [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  has dissolved when you take a really close look. But the problem is for a lot of the lesser [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=263.52s)]
*  nominees, people aren't really looking very carefully. What caught my eye about it was [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=269.67999999999995s)]
*  that I was writing a little bit about the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to become [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  the vice chairman of the Fed for supervision. She's incredibly well qualified, I mean, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=281.76s)]
*  and very well liked by the banking world also and had been confirmed twice before [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=288.08s)]
*  to very senior positions at the Fed and at the Treasury Department with bipartisan unanimous [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=296.0s)]
*  support. And suddenly there were these allegations that were pre-taxed, basically, that had nothing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=302.56s)]
*  to do with reality, that was kind of a made-up story claiming that she had an ethical problem. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=308.48s)]
*  And they didn't really go after her for what I think is the real beef that they had with her, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=315.44s)]
*  which was that she had said a few things about climate change and how it posed a risk to the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  economy. So I started looking at this group, trying to figure out who are these people? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=326.0s)]
*  And of course, it turned out that a lot of the senators were getting their research from this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=330.55999999999995s)]
*  group and the senators were getting their money from the fossil fuel industry, and they needed [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  a pre-tax to take her down in order to stop the Fed from including climate change as one of the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=338.96s)]
*  things that it might consider as an important economic risk. So anyway, I started trying to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=345.36s)]
*  find out who these people were. You also write about the expensive lengths to which this group [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=352.64s)]
*  appears to have gone to come up with these smears for some other nominees, including a woman who was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=359.92s)]
*  put forward to be comptroller of the currency, the one who was denounced as a communist. When [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  you describe them like sending people all over the world to try to dig stuff up that they could [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=370.32s)]
*  mischaracterize and take out of context and use against her, and then senators avidly digested it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  and threw it at her during that hearing, it raises this question of where they're getting all the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  funding to do this. And Jane, you've been so good at untangling how dark money works. What were you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=389.44s)]
*  able to find out about where the funding for this group comes from and who's doing it? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=395.6s)]
*  Well, surprisingly, the financial trail goes back to Donald Trump. He has a leadership pack [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  with hundreds of over a hundred million dollars in it. And one of those million dollars went from [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  his e-Leadership pack to the Conservative Partnership Institute, which is an organization [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=420.32s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. It's kind of like an island of Elba for the Trump administration. You've got [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=426.79999999999995s)]
*  Mark Meadows working there and a number of other people from the Trump world up there, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=432.64s)]
*  Cleta Mitchell. And it's bond to this other little sort of group, which is the American [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  Accountability Foundation. So it really is an offshoot of the Trump world and being funded [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=444.8s)]
*  in part by the Trump world. Jane Mayer, Chief Washington Correspondent for The New Yorker [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=451.92s)]
*  Magazine, untangling these knots one at a time for us. Thank you, Jane. I appreciate your reporting. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for talking to us about it tonight. Thanks for having me. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApYCgAneYuk&t=464.72s)]
