# Putin Manipulates Russians' Memory Of World War II To Shape False Ukraine Narrative
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs)
*  So now that the Russian troops are gone, the press can finally get a closer look. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=0.0s)]
*  But no matter what the Western press finds, Russian press is likely ready to say that [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=3.88s)]
*  what we see was either staged or carried out by an extremist Nazi faction within Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=8.6s)]
*  So how does the West help tackle this problem? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=14.48s)]
*  Especially if Russia can just create its own reality out of whole cloth and tell their [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=17.52s)]
*  people whatever they want. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=22.1s)]
*  Joining us now is Alana Minkovsky. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=24.8s)]
*  She's a Russian-American journalist who worked at the Russian state-run news agency RT America [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=26.76s)]
*  from 2009 to 2012. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=31.8s)]
*  She also brings a unique insight into what's going on in Russia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Her mother is currently a member of the Duma, the Russian parliament. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=37.92s)]
*  Alana, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=41.32s)]
*  Talk to me about this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  Do you think the Russian people are going to buy the idea that neo-Nazi Ukrainians are [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  trying to enact some sort of anti-Russian holocaust? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=49.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Oli. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, of course, not all Russian people are going to buy this, are buying it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=56.48s)]
*  You do see small little moments of people still trying to protest in the quietest, most [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  brave ways that they can, considering how dangerous it is to do there in that society. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=67.52s)]
*  Right now, we've seen people putting crosses out there in order to honor the people that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=72.36s)]
*  were massacred in Buche. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=76.88s)]
*  But at the same time, you have to realize that there is an informational vacuum in Russia [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=79.52s)]
*  right now that the only real news that most Russians are seeing, except for those who [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=85.36s)]
*  go out of their way to get a VPN, who are seeking out that information, is coming from [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=90.84s)]
*  the official channels on TV, on radio. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=95.24s)]
*  And those are the channels that are spreading these stories that you're showing that are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=98.44s)]
*  terrifying and also baffling in how outrageous and outlandish the lies are getting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=102.8s)]
*  And yet these are coming from the official channels from the government. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=108.8s)]
*  And so, you know, a lot of Russian people will believe them and will buy into them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=113.32s)]
*  And you know, the other thing is, the more and more you hear something repeated, no matter [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  how untrue it is, you might start to buy it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=121.74s)]
*  So help me understand this, because certainly in America, we know no matter what type of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=127.08s)]
*  news you consume or where it is on the political spectrum, you're aware that there's news from [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=131.42s)]
*  somewhere else on the political spectrum. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  And I'm assuming that's similar in Russia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=139.24s)]
*  So how are Russian people being sold on the idea that there was an independent press that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=141.8s)]
*  just up and vanished? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=147.44s)]
*  Well, I think everything that you're seeing here has been part of a years long effort, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=149.44s)]
*  you know, within Russia by Putin's regime to kind of normalize and prime the Russian [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=157.72s)]
*  public for what's happening right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  It starts with just this nostalgia for World War Two, patriotism and bravery in Russia. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=165.12s)]
*  That's something that has been nurtured. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=171.6s)]
*  There have been these Victory Day parades. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=172.92s)]
*  One is coming up on May 9th in Russia, you know, that has kind of sparned the collective [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=175.32s)]
*  memory of what it was that the Soviet people did during World War Two to fight back Nazis. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=181.18s)]
*  And don't forget, 27 million Soviet Union residents or people were estimated to have [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=186.6s)]
*  died during that conflict. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=192.84s)]
*  My grandparents took part in it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=195.4s)]
*  You know, every Russian has some relative family member. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=197.16s)]
*  They can relate to their so it's a real manipulation of this kind of collective memory to use that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  and then now start building this narrative of Nazism within the Ukrainian government. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=207.32s)]
*  And so, you know, it's just these kind of slow drips of information of resentment against [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=214.88s)]
*  the West that I think have primed people to slowly start normalizing, accepting the dehumanizing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=219.12s)]
*  and an increasingly radical information that they're starting to get there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=226.68s)]
*  I don't know how you necessarily break through it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  As I mentioned, there are still people who don't believe this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=233.84s)]
*  Perhaps it's a scary environment for them to talk about it, but they're using VPNs or [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=237.52s)]
*  accessing other information. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=242.68s)]
*  You know, so many young people that have grown up in Russia with access to the Internet, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=245.08s)]
*  with access to an independent media. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=249.8s)]
*  I don't think that they're just going to forget that that existed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=251.96s)]
*  How to create a political environment where Putin's regime can still can be stopped in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  that way by those people? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=264.64s)]
*  I think that's the bigger question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=266.4s)]
*  Alana, it is a big question and we thank you for helping us at least get started in this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=270.92s)]
*  discussion. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=274.44s)]
*  Alana Minkovsky, Alana Miskat Minkovsky is a Russian-American journalist and we thank [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=274.96s)]
*  you for your time tonight. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPJ3uNiuELs&t=279.08s)]
