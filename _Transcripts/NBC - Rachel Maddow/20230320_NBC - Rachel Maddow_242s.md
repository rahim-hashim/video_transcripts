# Trump's life-long record would make an indictment unsurprising
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8)
*  There's nothing technically improper or rule breaking or illegal about a former president facing charges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=0.0s)]
*  Even if it hasn't happened before, it doesn't break any rules. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=9.0s)]
*  But why has it never happened before? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=14.0s)]
*  Why has no one else before now considered a criminal indictment against a former president? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=17.0s)]
*  Is it because it's so dangerous? It's so unwise? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=24.0s)]
*  It's so somehow against our system to prosecute a former president? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=28.0s)]
*  Or is it just because there's never been one before who has lived this way? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=33.0s)]
*  Yes, from a historical perspective, an indictment against a former president is unprecedented. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=39.0s)]
*  But given that we're talking about this particular former president, Donald J. Trump, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=44.0s)]
*  can you honestly say to yourself that an indictment is a surprise? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=49.0s)]
*  The first thing anyone ever knew about his business practices was when he and his father [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=54.0s)]
*  had to settle with the Justice Department decades ago [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=59.0s)]
*  over accusations that they illegally refused to rent apartments to black people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=62.0s)]
*  Then by the time he was entering politics, he was paying another gigantic settlement, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=68.0s)]
*  a $25 million settlement, over fraud claims involving his fake university that he put his name on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=73.0s)]
*  Then his family charity was shut down and fined millions of dollars as a fraud. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=81.0s)]
*  Then his national security adviser pled guilty to lying to the FBI twice. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=87.0s)]
*  Then his campaign chairman went to federal prison on fraud charges. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=92.0s)]
*  Then his deputy campaign chairman went to federal prison as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=95.0s)]
*  Then his personal lawyer went to federal prison on fraud and campaign finance charges. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=98.0s)]
*  Then his other personal lawyer had his law license suspended on his way to potential disbarment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=102.0s)]
*  And his longest-serving political adviser was convicted on multiple felony counts [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=107.0s)]
*  and sentenced to federal prison for, among other things, witness intimidation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=111.0s)]
*  And his White House senior adviser was arrested on the yacht of a Chinese billionaire, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=115.0s)]
*  picked up on fraud charges. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=121.0s)]
*  And it turns out that preceded the Chinese billionaire himself being arrested on fraud charges. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=123.0s)]
*  And as president, he himself was impeached twice, which is a record, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=129.0s)]
*  with more impeachment votes against him from members of his own party than any other president in history. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=133.0s)]
*  And even since then, his company, which is literally called the Trump Organization, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=138.0s)]
*  was convicted on multiple felony fraud charges. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=143.0s)]
*  And his longtime CFO is in Rikers as we speak. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=147.0s)]
*  And when it comes to playing the odds and wondering what the stakes are for our country [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=154.0s)]
*  if an indictment, in fact, comes down for this former president, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=159.0s)]
*  we literally have to disambiguate the question so as to clarify which of the three known jurisdictions [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=162.0s)]
*  in which he's under criminal investigation are likely to go first. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=167.0s)]
*  So really, is this a surprise? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=171.0s)]
*  It's not like this is a normal former president. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=174.0s)]
*  Not just because he's provocative or extreme or speaks in a way that other... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=178.0s)]
*  You elect a guy with this kind of a life record. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=184.0s)]
*  Why would you expect all the criminal justice system activity that has surrounded him his entire life [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=188.0s)]
*  to suddenly evaporate when he entered this new phase of his post-public office life? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=193.0s)]
*  No, America has never before seen the indictment of a former president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=200.0s)]
*  But we did elect Donald Trump to be president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=205.0s)]
*  And his life, business and political milieu are a place in which handcuffs are like seasonal decorations. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=208.0s)]
*  Happy Equinox. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t_0qQ6aES8&t=217.0s)]
