# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 8
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI)
*  We'll give you a sense of what the Kramatorsk train station was like before the attack. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to show you the video that he made from the station just yesterday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=4.4s)]
*  Hey guys, this is Nate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=8.92s)]
*  I'm here at the Kramatorsk railway station. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=11.56s)]
*  There are thousands of people here that are waiting to get on trains to flee the city. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=14.92s)]
*  The trains are free for everybody, but there's no guarantee about when you get on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=19.76s)]
*  Today they've been prioritizing seniors and women and children to make sure that they [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=24.2s)]
*  can get out first. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=28.4s)]
*  There's multiple trains to different cities throughout the day, so if people can't get [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  on an earlier train, they can get on a later train. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=35.96s)]
*  The World Central Kitchen team is going to be setting up a tent here to support with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=39.76s)]
*  coffee, tea, some pastries as people are waiting quite a while. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  This is on the inside near the tracks, but back through the station on the outside of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=48.68s)]
*  the train station, there are hundreds and hundreds of people that are waiting just to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  get into this area. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=57.92s)]
*  Despite the thousands of people that are here, it's actually pretty amazingly well organized [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=59.72s)]
*  and controlled. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=64.44s)]
*  People are mostly remaining calm, although everybody is tense right now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=66.44s)]
*  There are rumors of attacks that are happening outside of the city, so people are rightfully [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=71.36s)]
*  nervous and they're trying to get out. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=76.84s)]
*  I've been to a train station in every city from which I've reported over the last five [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=81.28s)]
*  weeks, and they are all hubs of activity in a way that a typical rail station in America [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=85.32s)]
*  or Europe isn't. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  There are places where you see organizations like World Central Kitchen, Red Cross, UNICEF, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  UNHCR. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=96.44s)]
*  They feel like safe havens in a way. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=97.64s)]
*  They're the modern day village square. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=99.56s)]
*  I think it's really important to keep in mind, it's important to not just show pictures of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=102.0s)]
*  the destruction, but what was there before the attack, to give you some perspective on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  the scale and the horror of what took place. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=110.72s)]
*  Before, during, and after this attack on the civilian train station in Kramatorsk, World [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=114.96s)]
*  Central Kitchen was there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=120.24s)]
*  Now to tell us his firsthand account, we're joined by Nate Mook. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=121.64s)]
*  He's the CEO of World Central Kitchen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  He's a vital witness to what took place in Kramatorsk. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  Nate, thank you for being with us again. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  You, as we just showed, were at the station before the attack. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=133.72s)]
*  You were nearby when the attack happened, and then you went to the station literally [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=136.62s)]
*  to bear witness. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=142.0s)]
*  Tell us more about the people who were in the background of the video that you shot, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=143.72s)]
*  who've been at the station over the past few days while you were there, and the very same [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=148.8s)]
*  people who were likely there when this missile hit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=153.48s)]
*  Yeah, we had spent quite a bit of time at the railway station over the last few days [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  that we've been here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=161.92s)]
*  Thousands of people are at that station getting on these amazing evacuation trains that are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=163.56s)]
*  run by the railways to get people out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=168.32s)]
*  It is mostly mothers, their young children, infants, people in strollers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=171.52s)]
*  There's a lot of seniors there as well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=177.88s)]
*  People with wheelchairs, people with disabilities. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=180.92s)]
*  We saw railway workers helping people on their wheelchair up onto the trains as well. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=184.54s)]
*  I mean, those are the people that were at this station. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=190.28s)]
*  There were no other military people there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=193.84s)]
*  This was not a strategic location to strike. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=197.98s)]
*  This was a strike solely on innocent civilians, women, children, grandparents. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=201.38s)]
*  On both sides of the station, on the platform waiting and also out front, and what was so [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=209.74s)]
*  horrific about this attack was the scale at which the impact was hit. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=215.22s)]
*  This was not one isolated area. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=220.18s)]
*  The entirety of the station was hit. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=222.62s)]
*  People waiting in front, people along, waiting in an area on the platform where there were [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=226.62s)]
*  chairs for seniors and a tent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=232.22s)]
*  When we showed up, the fire department had just been putting out fires in burning cars. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  There were people still in those cars as they were burning. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  In the seating area, it was just complete devastation and carnage. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=245.89999999999998s)]
*  The amazing rescue services here, the emergency services here in Krematoresk moved very quickly. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  They got people to the hospitals. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=255.9s)]
*  But of course, just the scale of destruction by these missiles was just astounding. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=257.98s)]
*  Nate, I sort of alluded to this at the beginning, but I've been in train stations across Eastern [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=263.66s)]
*  and Central Europe and in Ukraine, and I've seen World Central Kitchen and almost all [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=271.86s)]
*  of them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=275.98s)]
*  But they're not what our viewers would expect a train station to look like. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=277.06s)]
*  the building and the platform and the trains, and then there are tents and humanitarian [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=280.42s)]
*  aid and translators and all sorts of things going on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  Give us a sense of the importance of a train station like this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  It's not simply a place to get on a train these days. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=293.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=296.3s)]
*  I mean, these train stations really are central hubs for the cities and for the country as [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=297.3s)]
*  well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the railway has been serving continuously and in many ways, they had been a bit of a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  refuge for families. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=310.54s)]
*  People have been living at the station as they either leave or they come in. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=313.74s)]
*  I was just up in Kharkiv, which is in a bit north of Krematoresk, the big city in the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=318.7s)]
*  east. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=323.5s)]
*  And although it is under constant shelling, the railway station has not been attacked. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=324.5s)]
*  There is sort of this, you know, acceptance that these are places filled with innocent [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=328.7s)]
*  civilians and Krematoresk was no different. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=333.58s)]
*  I mean, it was filled with families. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=336.46s)]
*  It was filled with people providing different services. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=338.1s)]
*  There were, of course, people, a lot of volunteers. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=342.22s)]
*  One of the volunteers that works closely with our lead on the ground here was killed today. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=346.34s)]
*  You know, these are really innocent, you know, just in just tragic, tragic situation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  Railway workers as well, the incredible heroic railway workers that are there helping out [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=358.82s)]
*  families are also there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=362.58s)]
*  And as we arrived, you know, luggage was strewn about. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=364.98s)]
*  I mean, it was a scene just cannot be put into words how horrific it was. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=368.06s)]
*  If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=385.58000000000004s)]
*  questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=394.94s)]
*  It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=400.9s)]
*  election, at this defining moment, change has come to America. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=411.26s)]
*  On the night of November 4th, 2008, Barack Obama became the first black person elected [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=416.7s)]
*  to the highest office in the land. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=429.82s)]
*  He reminded the country and the world of what democracy makes possible because of the people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=431.78s)]
*  who got out the vote, who organized registration drives, stood in line for hours to cast their [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=436.86s)]
*  ballots because of them, change arrived. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=442.38s)]
*  The following year, President Obama nominated Katanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Sentencing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=446.32s)]
*  Commission. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=451.28s)]
*  Three years later, he nominated her to the federal bench. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=452.52s)]
*  And today on the White House South Lawn, Judge Jackson reminded us of that history, which, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=456.08s)]
*  along with many others, many other building blocks helped lay the foundation for her Supreme [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=460.76s)]
*  Court confirmation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=465.94s)]
*  I am also ever buoyed by the leadership of generations past who helped to light the way, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=470.0s)]
*  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Justice Thurgood Marshall, and my personal heroine, Judge Constance [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=476.4s)]
*  Baker Motley. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=483.96s)]
*  They and so many others did the heavy lifting that made this day possible. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=484.96s)]
*  And for all of the talk of this historic nomination and now confirmation, I think of them as the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=491.8s)]
*  true path breakers. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=499.44s)]
*  I am just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=501.32s)]
*  No one does this on their own. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  The path was cleared for me so that I might rise to this occasion. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=513.74s)]
*  And in the poetic words of Dr. Maya Angelou, I do so now while bringing the gifts my ancestors [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=520.48s)]
*  gave. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=531.0s)]
*  I am the dream and the hope of the slave. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=533.0s)]
*  Judge Jackson worked hard for this moment. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=550.08s)]
*  She graduated from Harvard with honors twice. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=552.08s)]
*  Clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer worked as a public defender and served as a judge for [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=555.24s)]
*  ten years, but she credited the path breakers who came before her because their contributions [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  to this moment are a matter of fact. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=564.62s)]
*  Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to sit on the federal judiciary. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=567.64s)]
*  Motley worked on civil rights cases alongside Thurgood Marshall at the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=571.64s)]
*  Fund. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=576.6s)]

*  anything is possible. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  We've talked a lot on this show about the fact that Vladimir Putin's government is hiding [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  the truth of what's going on here in Ukraine from everyday Russian citizens. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=706.72s)]
*  Just yesterday we heard the Kremlin spokesman say that the photos and the videos of the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  atrocities in Bukha and other Ukrainian cities were all fake, staged by Ukraine and the West [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=715.48s)]
*  to make Russia look bad. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=722.2s)]
*  We also know that independent journalists within Russia cannot even call this war a [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=724.0s)]
*  war without fear of potentially facing up to 15 years in prison. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=729.04s)]
*  So what does that all mean for people in Ukraine who have family back in Russia or in Russian-occupied [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=734.2s)]
*  Crimea? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=740.6s)]
*  Their loved ones are hearing things from the Kremlin and state-run media that simply don't [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=741.64s)]
*  line up with the reality of what they're living through in real time. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=745.16s)]
*  I spoke to a few young people in this country about how the facts of this war are affecting [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=749.48s)]
*  their relationships with their immediate family. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=753.92s)]
*  You're living in a war. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=756.68s)]
*  And you talk to your mother, who's not here, and you have difficulty having this conversation [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  with her. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  She lives in Russia and she watches Russian TV and she says that she doesn't believe that [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=767.2s)]
*  it's Russian troops are here and that they are bombing our cities and killing our people. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=781.32s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=793.84s)]
*  So what does she believe? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=794.84s)]
*  What does she think is bombing? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=797.04s)]
*  I think she doesn't know where is the truth. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=798.88s)]
*  How do those conversations go with you? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=806.56s)]
*  Because you're in this war, you're frightened, she doesn't really believe that what's going [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=808.7199999999999s)]
*  on is happening. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=814.36s)]
*  So what do you talk about? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=815.56s)]
*  She tries to talk about something else, not about war. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  She tries to ask me about my health, about our weather and other stuff. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=823.48s)]
*  And I don't like it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=830.5200000000001s)]
*  Who have you got in your family who sees this differently? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=834.6800000000001s)]
*  So the war started in 2014. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=838.48s)]
*  And we have our relatives from here who moved to Russia, who lived in Russia, but they were [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=842.5200000000001s)]
*  living and studying here. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=850.2800000000001s)]
*  They're mixed, so the part of the family is from Russia, part of the family who is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=852.96s)]
*  here but they now live in Russia. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=857.84s)]
*  So in 2014 and 2015, where all of the war started, they were calling us asking what's [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=860.72s)]
*  happening. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=867.8000000000001s)]
*  So we told them about the revolution, that we would like to be in the EU, that we don't [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  want to be part of Russia, we are not one nation. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=872.9200000000001s)]
*  And then we just had a conversation, very impolite way, they are telling us that we [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=876.76s)]
*  are stupid, that you are idiots, what are you doing, how much the US paid you to vote [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=881.68s)]
*  for Poroshenko. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=888.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=889.4s)]
*  In 2014. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=890.4s)]
*  And has anything improved in terms of those relationships since 2014 or has it gotten [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=893.0799999999999s)]
*  worse now? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  It's gotten worse. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  We don't talk to them. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=900.3599999999999s)]
*  Where are your parents right now? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=901.8s)]
*  Our parents are in Simferopol, Crimea. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=903.7199999999999s)]
*  Tell me about how this conversation about this war goes with your parents. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=906.84s)]
*  Yeah, so we have difficult conversations since 2014. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=911.7600000000001s)]
*  We disagree on a lot of things. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=918.36s)]
*  But at that point, we could tell them more of a political debate because none of us was [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=923.7600000000001s)]
*  directly impacted by the war. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=929.0600000000001s)]
*  So we can just like, okay, we have different opinions. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=932.0200000000001s)]
*  We just have to accept this. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=935.4s)]
*  So we have sort of taboo on certain topics, not to raise them. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=937.24s)]
*  It not always worked. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=945.3199999999999s)]
*  We had many fights and argued a lot. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  And on 24th of February this year, when the full scale invasion started, we just received [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=951.52s)]
*  a text from mom, like, if how's it going, if we are alive. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=957.76s)]
*  We were really busy fleeing from Kiev at the time. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  Then once we arrived, I have never had a real conversation with my mom. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=966.52s)]
*  She is the most pro-Putin in our family. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=970.86s)]
*  And she, I think she also understands that like the conversation now can harm both of [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=974.28s)]
*  us. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=981.6s)]
*  Speaking about my father, who is more, who has more moderate views, and he is somehow [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=982.6s)]
*  able to de-escalate the situation. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=987.8000000000001s)]
*  He is able to accept multiple points of view. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=989.52s)]
*  But he again, as Christina mentioned, tries to avoid any like hot topics. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=993.3199999999999s)]
*  Difficult conversations and a reminder of why it's so important that the rest of the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  world sees what is truly happening here in Ukraine. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1008.64s)]
*  This is my last show with you for a while. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1013.84s)]
*  I leave Ukraine in a couple of days and I do so with a heavy heart. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1016.04s)]
*  Largely because of the suffering I've witnessed here and on the part of the refugees I met [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1020.04s)]
*  in Poland and Hungary before I got here. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1024.04s)]
*  But also because I've come to know a tiny percentage of the people of this nation and [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1027.08s)]
*  I'm deeply inspired by them. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1031.24s)]
*  They are showing the world what an existential fight for democracy looks like. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1033.48s)]
*  This show decided when the war began that it was important to concentrate on the many [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1038.7s)]
*  aspects of this horror. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1042.16s)]
*  And that has meant less coverage of some very important U.S. stories, which my MSNBC colleagues [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1044.64s)]
*  have done an incredible job of staying on top of and holding power to account. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  Those stories like the continued attacks on voting rights and abortion rights and gay [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1055.48s)]
*  rights and trans rights and the ongoing brazen attempts to subvert American democracy are [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1059.48s)]
*  not unrelated to the struggle for basic rights in this fledgling democracy of Ukraine. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1065.72s)]
*  There just aren't bombs and tanks and missiles and rockets involved at home. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1071.44s)]
*  But the fundamental urges are the same. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1075.88s)]
*  People yearn to be free, to love who they want and live where they want, free of threat. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1079.04s)]
*  The other lesson with which I leave is that in the face of growing atrocities against [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1084.3s)]
*  innocent civilians here, war crimes and what many in this country, including its president, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1088.72s)]
*  are calling an attempted genocide, the world needs to do better. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1093.8s)]
*  If it's tough for NATO and the U.N. to prevent one country from actually invading another [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1099.24s)]
*  and subverting its population, imagine the struggle our world order has with those countries [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1106.84s)]
*  in which portions of the population are persecuted by their own governments. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1112.4s)]
*  Afghanistan, Syria, China, Myanmar, Israel, India, to name just a few, and there are many [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  more. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  And we, meaning the media, have to do better at covering vulnerable populations all over [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1125.08s)]
*  the world. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1130.08s)]
*  We've given Ukraine and its four million refugees our full attention, as we should. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1131.08s)]
*  But we owe similar attention to the nearly 27 million other refugees in the world. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1137.0s)]
*  We are worried for the six and a half million Ukrainians who've not fled the country but [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1143.0s)]
*  have been forced or scared out of their homes to elsewhere in Ukraine. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1146.6799999999998s)]
*  Unbelievably, there are 48 million more such internally displaced people in the world. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnyiCJfJxI&t=1151.36s)]
