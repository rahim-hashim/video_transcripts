# Federal judges order Trump to rehire thousands of fired probationary federal employees
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w)
*  All right, update. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=0.0s)]
*  As we reported at the top of the show, federal judge in California today issued a blistering [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=2.44s)]
*  ruling from the bench in which he ordered the Trump administration to rehire thousands [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=7.44s)]
*  of people they had fired from the federal government at USDA, Defense Department, Energy [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=12.74s)]
*  Department, Department of the Interior, the Treasury and the VA. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=16.6s)]
*  Well, I got two updates for you because tonight, just as we are coming on the air, the plaintiffs [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=19.72s)]
*  in that case, the California federal case, the plaintiffs are the union representing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=24.64s)]
*  government workers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=29.64s)]
*  Plaintiffs went back to that same judge in California and essentially said, thank you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  for this ruling today, Your Honor. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=35.6s)]
*  Can you please make it so it applies to even more agencies? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=38.16s)]
*  They have now formally asked the judge to expand that order today to also order the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=41.24s)]
*  reinstatement of fired employees at the Commerce Department, Education Department, Health and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Justice Department, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=50.8s)]
*  Department of Transportation, the EPA, NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Small [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=55.32s)]
*  Business Administration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=59.5s)]
*  Update one. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=61.64s)]
*  Here's update two. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=62.64s)]
*  Just minutes after those plaintiffs asked the California federal judge to expand his [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=64.24s)]
*  ruling and order even more agencies to rehire even more people, a second federal judge across [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=68.6s)]
*  the country in Maryland issued a ruling, an entirely separate case, ordering the federal [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=75.64s)]
*  government also to rehire thousands of fired federal employees. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  This federal judge in Maryland tonight has just ordered that thousands of fired probationary [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  employees must now be reinstated at, ready for the list, Department of Agriculture, Department [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Health [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=100.88s)]
*  and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Interior, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Department of Labor, Department of Transportation, the Treasury Department, VA, USAID, the Consumer [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=109.04s)]
*  Financial Protection Bureau, the EPA, the FDIC, the General Services Administration, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=114.72s)]
*  the Office of Personnel Management, the Small Business Administration and the National Archives [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=119.64s)]
*  and Records Administration. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=124.62s)]
*  All of them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=126.64s)]
*  Reinstate all of your fired probationary employees. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=128.36s)]
*  And if it seems like there's overlap between the list in those two cases, you are correct. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=131.8s)]
*  As of tonight, just in today's news, we've got overlapping federal rulings ordering [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=136.8s)]
*  the immediate reinstatement of thousands of employees at multiple federal agencies. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you, the Maryland judge writes in this new order that's just out tonight, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  quote, the law is clear that when dismissing an employee due to unsatisfactory performance, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  the employer must honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer's conduct or performance [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=159.24s)]
*  after giving him a fair trial on the job. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=164.96s)]
*  Again, two federal judges tonight with equally sweeping rulings, both in the same direction, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  both telling Trump when you fired those people, you had no right, give them back their jobs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=175.44s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3A_nbdo2w&t=181.16000000000003s)]
