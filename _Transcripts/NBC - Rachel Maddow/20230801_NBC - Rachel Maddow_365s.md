# 'They knew to count on violence': Trump indictment shows willingness to seize power by force
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA)
*  I just want to note for the record that when you at home have a chance to read this thing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=0.0s)]
*  and you should, just to page through it when you have a quiet moment, trust me, you have [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=7.48s)]
*  read things longer than 45 pages, this is double-spaced, you'll get through it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=11.36s)]
*  If you have a quiet moment to read this, and I hope you do, if you are like me, I think [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=16.22s)]
*  the thing that will jump out at you is the violence. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=21.26s)]
*  Not descriptions of violence on January 6th, but the way Trump and his alleged co-conspirators [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=26.08s)]
*  talked about how violence was going to be part of this, how that was factored in to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  this alleged conspiracy in a way that these folks seem to expect. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=39.16s)]
*  They're not charged with riot. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=46.08s)]
*  They're not charged with sedition. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=48.32s)]
*  They are charged with exploiting the disturbance that they apparently, allegedly, intentionally [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=50.76s)]
*  caused. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=57.8s)]
*  They knew to count on violence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=59.56s)]
*  They factored it into their planning. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=62.48s)]
*  That comes out in the indictment in a way that will keep you up. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=65.12s)]
*  It comes up, for example, in the section on trying to decapitate the Justice Department [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=70.2s)]
*  and then put in this guy, Jeff Clark, and use the authority of the Justice Department [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=75.56s)]
*  to tell the states that they should throw out election results. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=81.16s)]
*  This is just something I want to show you here from page 30 of the indictment. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=85.44s)]
*  The alleged co-conspirator that's being described here is Jeffrey Bossert Clark. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=89.76s)]
*  He's the guy who Trump tried to put in charge of the Justice Department, apparently named [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=93.76s)]
*  him acting attorney general, so that Clark could carry out this plot there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=97.68s)]
*  Just look at this. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=102.08s)]
*  On the afternoon of January 3, co-conspirator four, who we believe to be Jeff Clark, spoke [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=103.96s)]
*  with the Deputy White House counsel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=109.32s)]
*  The previous month, the Deputy White House counsel had informed defendant Trump that, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=111.55999999999999s)]
*  quote, there is no world, there is no option in which you do not leave the White House [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=115.52s)]
*  on January 20th. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=119.96s)]
*  Now, the same Deputy White House counsel tried to dissuade Jeff Clark from assuming the role [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=121.6s)]
*  of acting attorney general. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  The Deputy White House counsel reiterated to Clark that there had not been outcome determinative [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=128.54s)]
*  fraud in the election and that if defendant Trump remained in office nonetheless, there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=133.24s)]
*  would be, quote, riots in every major city in the United States. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  Jeff Clark responded, well, that's why there's an insurrection act. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  The indictment continues. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  Also that afternoon, Clark met with the acting attorney general and told him that defendant [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  Trump had decided to put Jeff Clark in charge of the Justice Department. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=155.4s)]
*  That same afternoon, Trump decides to put Clark in charge of the Justice Department [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=161.52s)]
*  after Clark says that day, oh, the country is going to rise up in every city in the country [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  because we're going to try to hold power by force. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, we'll use the Insurrection Act. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=176.08s)]
*  That's what the Insurrection Act is for. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=178.0s)]
*  What does the Insurrection Act do? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  It allows the president to call up the U.S. military and use the army to take over American [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=181.68s)]
*  streets and use military force against the American people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=187.8s)]
*  That's what the Insurrection Act is for. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  That's why there's an Insurrection Act. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=194.36s)]
*  Now look, a few pages later, in part of the indictment that's about pressuring Vice President [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=199.44s)]
*  Mike Pence, we're still on January 4th at this point, so it's still in advance of January [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  6th. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=207.96s)]
*  And look at this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=208.96s)]
*  Also on January 4th, when co-conspirator to Trump lawyer John Eastman acknowledged to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump's senior advisor that no court would support his proposal for overturning the election [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  results, Trump's senior advisor told John Eastman, quote, You're going to cause riots [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  in the streets. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  Eastman responded that there had previously been points in the nation's history where [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  violence was necessary to protect the republic. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=233.16s)]
*  On the morning of January 5th, at defendant Trump's direction, Vice President's chief [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  of staff and the vice president's counsel met again with Eastman. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=241.54s)]
*  Eastman now advocated that Vice President Pence do what defendant Trump had said he [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=244.48s)]
*  preferred the day before, that Pence should unilaterally reject electors from the targeted [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=248.2s)]
*  states. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  During this meeting, Eastman privately acknowledged to the vice president's counsel he hoped to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  prevent judicial review of this proposal because he understood it would be unanimously rejected [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=259.36s)]
*  by the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=264.08s)]
*  The vice president's counsel expressed to Eastman that following through with the proposal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=266.0s)]
*  results in a quote disastrous situation where the election might have to be decided in the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=270.24s)]
*  streets. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=275.04s)]
*  Decided in the streets. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=278.36s)]
*  The indictment continues, quote, That same day, defendant Trump encouraged supporters [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=281.48s)]
*  to travel to Washington on January 6th and he set the false expectation that the vice [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=285.36s)]
*  president had the authority and might to use his ceremonial role at the certification proceeding [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=290.16s)]
*  to reverse the election outcome in the defendant's favor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=295.64s)]
*  John Eastman saying, Sometimes we need violence. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=300.4s)]
*  Hey, this might be decided in the streets. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=302.84s)]
*  Trump says, Let's get him in the streets. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=305.08s)]
*  He is innocent until proven guilty. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  This will be an adversarial process and the country for the sake of history and for the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=311.84s)]
*  sake of the country has to hope that he has an excellent defense and that this is well [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=317.24s)]
*  fought and fair. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  He is innocent until proven guilty. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=323.72s)]
*  But if the allegations made by the Justice Department in this indictment are proven, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=325.24s)]
*  history will not ask how we got to the point where they had to indict a former president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=329.04s)]
*  History will ask how did a person like this get elected to the U.S. presidency? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=333.16s)]
*  Where these actions could be carried out from the Oval Office directed by an American president. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=338.0s)]
*  . [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLR1F7kJJA&t=353.72s)]
