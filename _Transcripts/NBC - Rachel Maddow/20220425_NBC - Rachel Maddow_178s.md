# While U.S. Invests In Electric Vehicle Chargers, Elon Musk Has ...Other Priorities
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM)
*  The Biden infrastructure bill allocated $7.5 billion to build electric vehicle charging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=0.0s)]
*  stations all around the country. They have just started spending that money from the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=6.24s)]
*  bipartisan infrastructure bill. And $7.5 billion on that, $7.5 billion on new charging stations, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=9.6s)]
*  should make a noticeable difference. It should make electric vehicles [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=17.36s)]
*  the smarter choice for millions of Americans. That will really help. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=21.92s)]
*  But this, I mean, all this to say, it's sort of really finally happening. When it comes to trying [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=25.52s)]
*  to get America to transition away from gas-powered vehicles, we know what Ford is up to with the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=31.28s)]
*  largest selling vehicle in America. That's going to be a big day for that tomorrow. We know what the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=37.6s)]
*  Biden administration is up to with those infrastructure dollars already starting to flow. But what about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=41.6s)]
*  the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer? What are they up to right now? Oh, right. They are [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=47.68s)]
*  eccentric. CEO is shelling out an ungodly amount of money to buy a social media website. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=55.68s)]
*  That seems like a great use of $44 billion. Tesla CEO, world's richest man, Elon Musk, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=62.8s)]
*  has reportedly inked a deal to purchase the social media company Twitter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=70.8s)]
*  He's going to spend $44 billion to do it, and then he will own it privately. I know that when [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=74.96s)]
*  people start throwing around big numbers, like numbers with three commas in them, it can be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=81.36s)]
*  hard to keep track of what any of it really means. But just consider this just in in this context. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=85.2s)]
*  I mentioned the bipartisan infrastructure bill allocated $7.5 billion for EV charging stations [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=90.72s)]
*  for the entire country. Elon Musk is spending nearly six times that amount [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  to buy a website where people can write stuff in 280 characters. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk buying Twitter says a lot about the priorities of people at the highest levels [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  making decisions that could affect the fate of the planet. But of course, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=114.8s)]
*  it also raises a lot of questions about what will happen to what is perhaps the most influential [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=119.28s)]
*  social media company in the world at a time when authoritarians, insurrectionists, and rogue petro [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=123.52s)]
*  states are weaponizing disinformation online in a way they've never done so before. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=128.56s)]
*  Elon Musk says he is buying Twitter to save free speech online. And what he means by that is he [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=133.84s)]
*  wants to push back on efforts to moderate content on these websites. Why do these websites moderate [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  content? And what does he want to do instead? What will it mean for our society and our democracy [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=146.16s)]
*  that one of the biggest social media companies in the world will only be accountable to that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  one guy and what he considers free speech? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zboaVgjI6hM&t=154.88s)]
