# Judge sets deadline to decide on protective order restraining Trump on evidence, witnesses
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ)
*  So there's some breaking news tonight in the latest federal criminal case against former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=3.5s)]
*  We knew we were going to get something in that case this afternoon or this evening. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=4.84s)]
*  We didn't know we were going to get this other thing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=8.48s)]
*  Here's the situation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=11.84s)]
*  Let me explain it in layman's terms as I, not a lawyer, understand them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=12.84s)]
*  On Friday night, special counsel Jack Smith asked the judge in this case for a protective [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=17.6s)]
*  order, which basically means when the government hands evidence over to Trump's defense team [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=22.38s)]
*  for use in the trial, the judge should order Trump and his lawyers to not release any of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=26.979999999999997s)]
*  that evidence publicly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=32.1s)]
*  In making that request, Jack Smith's team pointed the judge to this social media post [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=34.3s)]
*  from Trump last week. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=40.1s)]
*  If you go after me, I'm coming after you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=41.339999999999996s)]
*  By putting this in there, filing, requesting the protective order, they were basically [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=43.66s)]
*  alerting the judge to the presence of this posting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=47.58s)]
*  The implication was, hey, if this is the kind of thing this guy is saying publicly at this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=51.68s)]
*  stage, there's no telling what else he would post when we start giving him stuff that's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=55.14s)]
*  really sensitive. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=58.34s)]
*  So on Friday, prosecutors asked the judge for this protective order. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  They cited that troubling posting by Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=64.14s)]
*  Today, this afternoon, we knew that Trump's defense team had to file its reply. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=67.1s)]
*  They did almost as if they were confirming the contentions from the prosecutors in their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=72.86s)]
*  filing with the judge. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=78.7s)]
*  They took this proposed protective order, the things that prosecutors said Trump and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=80.26s)]
*  his team should be barred from releasing to the public. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=84.5s)]
*  And they said that a whole bunch of stuff should be crossed off that list. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=87.3s)]
*  They specified recordings, transcripts, interview reports, related exhibits of witness interviews. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=90.9s)]
*  Trump's team said tonight, we ought to be able to do whatever we want with all of that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=99.06s)]
*  stuff, including making all that stuff available to the public. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  So that filing from Trump's team saying, no, no protective order is necessary. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=107.28s)]
*  You should much more narrowly tailor it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=112.92s)]
*  We should be able to do whatever we want with all the evidence that we get. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=114.72s)]
*  That was the filing we were expecting tonight from Trump's team. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=118.04s)]
*  What we didn't expect was for Jack Smith's prosecutors to come back within just a couple [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=121.16s)]
*  of hours with a big, hard-nosed response, pushing back hard on Trump's proposal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=126.04s)]
*  This is from the new filing from prosecutors that came in just within the last hour. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=133.28s)]
*  Quote, the defendant, Trump, proposed an order designed to allow him to try this case in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=137.6s)]
*  the media rather than in the courtroom. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=142.84s)]
*  The defendant's principal objection to our proposed protective order is that it would [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  not permit him or his counsel to publicly disseminate and publicize in the media various [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  materials obtained from the government in discovery. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  They also say they want to make sure Trump is not allowed to personally write down any [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=157.56s)]
*  personally identifying information, such as addresses and phone numbers of witnesses. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=161.4s)]
*  They say that, quote, is particularly important here because of the defendant and his co-conspirators [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=166.74s)]
*  practice, as described in the indictment, of publicly targeting individuals. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=172.12s)]
*  In their filing, Jack Smith's prosecutors urged the judge to implement the protective [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=177.68s)]
*  order that they proposed in order to safeguard witness privacy and the integrity of these [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  proceedings. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=187.6s)]
*  In other words, hey, judge, you know what this guy is like. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=188.6s)]
*  You know he has a habit of publicly targeting witnesses against him and anybody else who [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=192.0s)]
*  goes up against him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=196.54000000000002s)]
*  Now he's saying he wants to be able to publicize evidence and things about witnesses that we [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=197.92s)]
*  give him as part of this trial. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=202.96s)]
*  Don't let him do that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=204.88s)]
*  Again, protective order was requested on Friday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=206.68s)]
*  Trump's defense team had to file its response by five o'clock today. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=210.12s)]
*  They did so right before five o'clock. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=213.04s)]
*  Then Jack Smith's prosecutors came back just a couple of hours after Trump's team handed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=215.24s)]
*  in their filing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=220.7s)]
*  When prosecutors say they want these proceedings to go speedily, this is what they mean. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=222.24s)]
*  They are apparently not kidding around. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=226.24s)]
*  And the judge appears to be on the same page because just in the last few minutes, oh wait, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  there's more. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  Just in the last few minutes, the judge has ordered a hearing on the issue of this protective [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  order to take place no later than this Friday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=238.84s)]
*  Again, this minute, the minute order from Judge Chutkin just handed down saying no [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=242.28s)]
*  dawdling people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=248.52s)]
*  We are going to do this this week. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=249.52s)]
*  We are holding a hearing on it no later than the end of this week. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp525wsXHvQ&t=250.76000000000002s)]
