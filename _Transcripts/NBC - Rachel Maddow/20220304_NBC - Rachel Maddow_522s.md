# Putin Cracks Down On News That Threatens His War Narrative; Outlaws Contradiction
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg)
*  This is Alexandra. She is 25 years old. She lives in Kharkiv, Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=0.0s)]
*  And today she actually spoke to the BBC about her mother. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Her mother actually lives in Moscow, Russia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=10.72s)]
*  And she was telling the BBC that her own mother did not believe her [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=13.24s)]
*  when she said that her city in Kharkiv, Ukraine was being shelled by Russian forces. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=18.48s)]
*  She said, I didn't want to scare my parents, but I started telling them directly [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=24.12s)]
*  that civilians and children are dying. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=27.88s)]
*  And her parents, to her surprise, responded by saying that the Russian army would never target civilians, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=30.32s)]
*  that it's Ukrainians who are killing their own people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=35.64s)]
*  And to her shock, Alexandra says that her mother just repeated the narrative of what she heard on Russian state TV. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=38.76s)]
*  Russian state media, of course, has sought to obscure the reality of what is happening in Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=45.8s)]
*  There are no reports of missiles hitting residential districts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=51.44s)]
*  There is no coverage of Russian casualties or the ongoing protests that are taking place inside of Russia. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=54.44s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, Russia's last independent radio station, Echo Moskva, was shut down [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=60.12s)]
*  and Russia's last independent TV station, TV RAIN, broadcast its final news update. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=65.32s)]
*  And this morning, Russia blocked the sites of Russian language, Western media like Radio Free Europe, Voice of America, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=70.96s)]
*  Deutsche Welle and, of course, the BBC. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=76.36s)]
*  All while the audience for the BBC's Russian language news site alone reached 10.7 million people last week alone, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  more than triple its usual average. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Now today, Russia went even further, blocking access to both Facebook and Twitter. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=89.12s)]
*  And this morning, the Russian Duma, their parliament, made it illegal and punishable by 15 years in prison [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  to report anything the Russian government deems to be false information about the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=100.48s)]
*  Oh, by the way, Russia doesn't call it a war and neither can the reporters there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=105.8s)]
*  They are calling it a special military operation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=110.96s)]
*  So all of the news that you see coming out of Russia has to come from the government itself. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=114.16s)]
*  The BBC announced today that this law basically left them no other option than to temporarily suspend the work [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  of BBC news journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=126.6s)]
*  Other outlets started following suit. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  So while we have had footage to show of some of the more than 8,000 anti-war protesters that have been arrested in Russia, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  that kind of reporting, that kind of journalism just became a lot more risky. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=139.28s)]
*  In fact, it is now punishable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  And this crackdown comes as imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is calling for more mass protests [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  inside Russia and around the world this coming Sunday. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  Today, four major Russian independent news outlets, including the Novaya Gazeta, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  the newspaper whose editor just won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=162.32s)]
*  decided that this new law actually made it impossible for them to report on the war truthfully [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=166.2s)]
*  without their reporters being thrown in prison. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  So now they aren't reporting on it at all. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=175.6s)]
*  The independent news site Medusa was also blocked by the Russian government today, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  but they have experience working around the Russian government because Medusa has always reported on Russia, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  in Russian, but they have done it from Latvia, outside of Russia's borders, to stay as independent as possible. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=187.88s)]
*  So even though their site was blocked inside of Russia, they have not stopped reporting. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=196.28s)]
*  Joining us now from Latvia is Alexei Kovalev, the investigations editor at Medusa. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=201.64s)]
*  Mr. Kovalev, thank you so much for being with us tonight. I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=207.24s)]
*  Let's start with the development today. Now that the Russian government has blocked your website in Russia, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=211.6s)]
*  how do you expect, how do you plan on getting your news, your information, your reporting accessible to people inside of Russia? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  Morning, Eamon, and thank you for having me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=225.88s)]
*  Well, we've been waiting for this. We've been anticipating this for quite some time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=228.36s)]
*  So we've been educating our audience, our followers, to use different means of circumventing these bans. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=235.16s)]
*  And, you know, over the past few years, Russians have become quite adept to using all kinds of VPNs and proxies [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=243.04s)]
*  because more and more huge swathes of Russian Internet are becoming inaccessible to Russians for, you know, carpet bans of sorts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=249.36s)]
*  So, yeah, we had some contingency plans and we're continuing to broadcast on our app, on our Telegram channel. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=260.48s)]
*  And hopefully we'll recover some of our website audience as well as people, as more and more people adopt VPNs and proxies [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=267.48s)]
*  and all kinds of different anti-Internet blockage devices. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=275.2s)]
*  Yeah, incredible defiance on your part. I'm curious to get your thoughts on what will this media crackdown [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=281.24s)]
*  that we have seen intensify on independent media inside actually mean for the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=286.24s)]
*  Do you think it will have any impact what Russia has done today on the information flow? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=292.52s)]
*  Well, it's crucial that the Russian public understands what's going on. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  And this is the motivation behind such a precedent and assault on the media in the country. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't think it has any precedent in Russia's history, even in the Soviet times. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=311.08s)]
*  But, you know, what you said earlier about the BBC report, it's actually real and it's happening in many Russian families too, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=316.84s)]
*  because like many Russian families, mine also has relatives in Ukraine, different parts of my family, my wife's family. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=324.44s)]
*  Well, we all have Ukrainian relatives and it's happening all across that spectrum that Ukrainian relatives saying, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=331.23999999999995s)]
*  hey, look, your army is bombing our cities. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, the Russian relatives are saying, no, that's not true because they told us on the television [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=341.56s)]
*  that the Russian army is not bombing any civilian infrastructure. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=347.68s)]
*  It's only striking military targets. And that's it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=352.68s)]
*  It's just so hard to convince people because you're not just, you know, it's hard enough to make people admit a simple, honest mistake. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=355.96s)]
*  But you're actually asking them to admit complicity in war crimes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=365.28s)]
*  So which their television, which is on for most of the time in most Russian households, has been telling them nonstop that it's simply not happening, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=370.36s)]
*  that it couldn't be happening just because. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=379.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty hard to challenge that narrative. And that's what we're doing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=381.36s)]
*  So let me ask you then go back to the point that you were talking about some of the stories or anecdotes you've been hearing from, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=385.04s)]
*  you know, Russian family members being told about what's happening inside of Ukraine by other Ukrainian family members. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=389.8s)]
*  How does one approach trying to deprogram the chunk of the Russian population that fully believes that state TV tells them? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=396.16s)]
*  I mean, how can, you know, we and your news organization combat that level of misinformation? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=403.48s)]
*  Well, I'll be honest. You know, this this is this looks like this looks like an insurmountable problem [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=410.92s)]
*  because there is simply it's simply the economies of scale. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=420.08s)]
*  I mean, dozens of millions of people are tuned into Russian TV and fewer and fewer are going to have access to independent media like ours. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's not doesn't mean we're we're just, you know, ceasing to do our jobs because if not for now, we're doing this for the historical record. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=433.2s)]
*  Because, you know, as I said before, my job is now basically documenting my country's war crimes for any future international tribunals. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=442.36s)]
*  So, yeah, we're doing as much as we can to convince people to educate people about what's going on now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think we've we've made some some progress because people are now sharing links to Medusa and other few remaining independent video news websites in Russia. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=458.88s)]
*  You know, like Secret Pamphlets, because what we have now is is as close as we get to martial law with all the civil liberties and, you know, free free press suspended. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=469.04s)]
*  Yeah, the information space in Russia continues to shrink by the day. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=481.68s)]
*  Alexei Kovalev, sir, thank you so much to you and your entire staff. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=484.72s)]
*  You are the investigations editor at the Russian language news site Medusa. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  Greatly appreciate the work all of you are doing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=492.56s)]
*  Thank you for your time tonight. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=494.68s)]
*  This past week, Rachel and our team here have been periodically checking in on a man named. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA3AuoFTIwg&t=496.64s)]
