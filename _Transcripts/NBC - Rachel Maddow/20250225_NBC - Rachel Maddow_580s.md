# 'Rogue president': Trump removal of senior military leaders, military lawyers raises alarm
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0)
*  Senior U.S. military officers and senior civilians in the Defense Department, really senior, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=0.0s)]
*  like people who serve on the Joint Chiefs, people who are secretaries of the various [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  branches of the military, I have been able to meet and interview and get to know more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=9.08s)]
*  of them than you'd think. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=13.9s)]
*  I wrote a book about the military a decade or so ago, and that started a process in which [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I met a lot of these folks, and it's been an honor. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=20.04s)]
*  And while folks at that very senior level come from all sorts of different backgrounds, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=24.36s)]
*  they come to those leadership positions through all sorts of different routes, by the time [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=28.8s)]
*  any of them have served at the most senior ranks of the military in the Defense Department, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=33.2s)]
*  I think one of the things you can say about all of them in unison is that they are measured. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=38.0s)]
*  They are calm. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=45.68s)]
*  The word unflappable is almost right, but it feels like it needs a more worrying root [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=47.8s)]
*  word than flap. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=52.2s)]
*  These are people who are like epically even keeled. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=54.2s)]
*  And that is why I asked to be on the show tonight, the man who, until last month, served [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=59.64s)]
*  as Secretary of the United States Air Force. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=64.0s)]
*  His name is Frank Kendall. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  He is a West Point graduate, an Army veteran, a former Undersecretary of Defense, and for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  the last four years he was Secretary of the United States Air Force. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=72.48s)]
*  He is not a flappable man. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=76.88s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=80.92s)]
*  Friday night, President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the sudden [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=83.4s)]
*  and unexplained removal of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest ranking [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=87.68s)]
*  officer in the United States Navy, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and the senior [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=92.16s)]
*  lawyers, the senior legal officers in the Air Force and the Army and the Navy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Now Frank Kendall responded to that in writing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=103.76s)]
*  And what he wrote to me is the unflappable veteran defense official version of an air [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=110.4s)]
*  raid siren. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  Just listen to this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Quote, President Trump's decision to fire senior military leaders without cause is foolish [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  and a disgrace. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  It politicizes our professional military in a dangerous and debilitating way. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=126.42s)]
*  What frightens me most is the removal of three judge advocates general, the most senior uniformed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  legal authorities in the Defense Department. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=137.32s)]
*  Their removal is one more element of this administration's attack on the rule of law [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=139.96s)]
*  and an especially disturbing part. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  The military's top judge advocates general are the senior military professionals who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  interpret and enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the rules that guide troops [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=150.56s)]
*  in the field. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=154.56s)]
*  They have the independent legal authority to tell any military commander or political [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=155.72s)]
*  appointee that an order from the president or the secretary of defense is unlawful, cannot [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=160.0s)]
*  be given and should not be obeyed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=165.24s)]
*  Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth will now get to choose the JAG leadership for all three military [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=168.24s)]
*  departments. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=173.0s)]
*  One has to ask why JAG leadership was singled out for replacement. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=174.44s)]
*  This is part of a much larger pattern of disrespect, even disdain for the rule of law. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=178.68s)]
*  If there is one characteristic of this president and this administration, it is the utter lack [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=183.0s)]
*  of respect for legal constraints. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=187.12s)]
*  Kendall says, quote, we are in danger when the legal constraints on how the president [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=189.72s)]
*  uses the military, including within the United States, are ignored or brushed aside. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=193.8s)]
*  Our country is in uncharted territory. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  We have an administration that is waging war against the rule of law. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=202.28s)]
*  The evidence is everywhere. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=205.44s)]
*  We don't yet know how far it will go as it seeks to control, reinterpret, rewrite, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=206.96s)]
*  ignore or defy legal constraints, including the Constitution itself. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  He concludes with this. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  The replacement of the military JAG leadership is one skirmish in that war, but it is time [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  for the American people across the political spectrum to recognize what is happening. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=222.58s)]
*  Quote, America has a rogue president and a rogue administration, and we need to acknowledge [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=227.66000000000003s)]
*  that and respond. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=234.34s)]
*  Joining us now is Frank Kendall, who until last month was Secretary of the United States [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  Air Force. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=242.62s)]
*  Secretary Kendall, it is a real honor to have some time with you tonight. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=243.62s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=246.34s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=247.34s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=248.34s)]
*  Am I right to read this as you essentially sending an alert that although, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=250.82s)]
*  to civilians this might not have registered at first glance, like the biggest deal, given [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=255.66s)]
*  everything else, you're essentially telling the public this is a very big deal and one [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=260.02s)]
*  that needs a response? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=265.38s)]
*  It is a big deal, and I chose my words carefully and very thoughtfully. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=268.26s)]
*  I felt that in the announcements about the people being replaced that the removal of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=272.98s)]
*  Judge Advocate Generals, the head lawyers for each of the services, was not getting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=278.42s)]
*  the attention that it deserved. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  And I really wanted to call some attention to that because of the implications that could [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=283.7s)]
*  possibly have. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=287.18s)]
*  In terms of the removal of those legal officers, I found it striking that in the announcement [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  about their removal they weren't even named, implying that they were removed as a class [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=294.22s)]
*  of people rather than as individual public servants and officers who were removed for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=298.62s)]
*  some specific reason as to how they were doing their job. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=303.94s)]
*  What is the thing you most worry about in terms of replacing senior legal military officers [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=307.82s)]
*  at this level and doing so as a group? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  First of all, I have a lot of confidence in our Judge Advocate General. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=319.5s)]
*  This is a class of very professional people. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=323.58s)]
*  I've worked with them over most of my career in a number of different capacities, and I've [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=325.58s)]
*  seen what they can do. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=329.9s)]
*  What I'm concerned about though here is that there'll be some effort to find people who [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=331.42s)]
*  are going to be very compliant with whatever the administration wants to do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=335.54s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth has made some public comments about this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=340.98s)]
*  He's talked about, you know, JAGs constraining operators excessively when they're engaged [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=343.42s)]
*  in combat. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=349.82000000000005s)]
*  That's a concern that lower ranking people might have about not being allowed to use [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=350.82000000000005s)]
*  as much firepower as they'd like, for example. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  But the rules of engagement, the rules of armed conflict and so on are there for a reason, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=358.42s)]
*  and they have to be followed by people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  And we use the JAGs to help enforce that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=364.74s)]
*  That's one aspect of it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=367.34s)]
*  But there are a number of other things that the JAGs would be able to pronounce judgments [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=368.46s)]
*  on and again have legal authority over people in uniform. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=371.38s)]
*  And that includes, as you mentioned, use of the military within the United States against [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=375.06s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  There are legal constraints on how the military can be used. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=380.74s)]
*  But as with all laws, they're subject to interpretation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=384.44s)]
*  So I'm concerned about the direction in which this is heading. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=388.14s)]
*  This wasn't part of the DEI, you know, war against DEI that's being waged. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=391.78s)]
*  The JAGs really have no role in that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  These are not people who have, you know, other than fairly neural responsibilities, well [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=398.73999999999995s)]
*  down within the structure of each of the services. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=403.05999999999995s)]
*  So it really struck me as unusual and hard to understand why these particular people [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=406.26s)]
*  would be single out for replacement. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=411.26s)]
*  When you said America has a rogue president and a rogue administration, I'd like to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=415.14s)]
*  hear how you define those terms and what you mean by that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=421.54s)]
*  I take you at your word that you chose those words very carefully. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=425.18s)]
*  But you followed that assertion immediately with we need to acknowledge that and respond. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=428.82s)]
*  So I'd also like to hear from you what you think the appropriate response is. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=433.5s)]
*  First of all, we're seeing a number of behaviors, and not just these of the military and so [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=438.26s)]
*  on, but we're seeing the use of a non-government employee, a billionaire to come in and pretty [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=442.94s)]
*  much wreak havoc with the with the entire federal government apparatus. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=448.70000000000005s)]
*  We're seeing declarations of things like birthright citizenship no longer being valid [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  under the Constitution. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=457.42s)]
*  And so there's a large range of things not following the law and relieving the inspector [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=458.42s)]
*  generals that were relieved. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=462.62s)]
*  I think your previous guest mentioned that there are 75 lawsuits going on right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=465.26000000000005s)]
*  President Trump made the comment recently that, you know, if you're saving the nation, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  you're above the law, in words to that effect. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=476.06s)]
*  These are dangerous things to hear from an American president, and the conduct has been [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=478.94s)]
*  very consistent. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=482.18s)]
*  So I think rogue is a reasonable description. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=483.62s)]
*  I think it's an apt description. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=486.29999999999995s)]
*  And I think it should make us all concerned as citizens. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=488.78s)]
*  Whatever our views on various issues, we all should believe in the rule of law. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=492.18s)]
*  It's the most fundamental American principle. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=496.29999999999995s)]
*  It distinguishes us from, you know, almost any totalitarian state, certainly. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=498.41999999999996s)]
*  And so we should all be united in saying, no, wait a minute, whatever our differences [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=504.42s)]
*  may be, if we're going to work, we can pursue those, we can debate, we can we can have processes [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=507.74s)]
*  play out to try to resolve those differences. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=512.66s)]
*  But we have to do that within the within the law. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=515.38s)]
*  That is so fundamental to the existence of our democracy and to our freedom as citizens [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=518.66s)]
*  that I think every American should should recognize that that's a concern. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=522.9399999999999s)]

*  Thank you for helping us understand this time. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=537.22s)]
*  And thank you for writing this in the blunt terms that you did, at least for me. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=538.78s)]
*  It really broke through and it made me understand this in a way that I didn't previously. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=543.62s)]
*  And it's scary to me, but I appreciate your expertise. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDd-OPYJUc0&t=548.14s)]
