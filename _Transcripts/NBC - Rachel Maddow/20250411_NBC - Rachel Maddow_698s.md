# 'How is it possible that you have this job?': RFK Jr.'s incompetence becomes too glaring to overlook
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0)
*  Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have fired 10,000 people from the nation's health [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=0.0s)]
*  agencies in the last couple of weeks. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=4.72s)]
*  They have cut billions and billions and billions of dollars in health research and health programs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=6.44s)]
*  But apparently, somebody forgot to tell Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that that's what he was doing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=12.36s)]
*  You proposed more than $11 billion in cuts to local and state programs addressing things [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=18.28s)]
*  like infectious disease, mental health, addiction and childhood vaccination. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=23.84s)]
*  Did you personally approve those cuts? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=28.34s)]
*  I'm not familiar with those cuts. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=30.18s)]
*  I mean, we'd have to go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=32.74s)]
*  We'd have to go. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  There's like more than 50 pages of, you know, of cuts that I actually went through. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  The cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=41.46s)]
*  There were a lot, but I'll give you, for example, about $750,000 of a University of Michigan [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=44.06s)]
*  grant into adolescent diabetes was cut. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=48.9s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=52.18s)]
*  I didn't know that, and that's something that we'll look at. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=53.18s)]
*  I'm not familiar with those cuts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=59.34s)]
*  I'm not familiar with those cuts. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=63.34s)]
*  Those cuts are mainly DEI cuts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=64.66s)]
*  We cut infectious disease and mental health and addiction. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=66.94s)]
*  That sounds like a terrible idea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=69.58s)]
*  We cut adolescent diabetes stuff? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=70.98s)]
*  Well, that's something that we'll look at. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=73.06s)]
*  I thought these were all DEI cuts. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  How is it possible you have this job? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  But while Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims to know nothing about the massive cuts, he [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=83.38s)]
*  has made at the various agencies he runs. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=88.34s)]
*  Or maybe it wasn't him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=91.78s)]
*  Hey, if it wasn't you, who did them? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=92.78s)]
*  One thing he does claim to be very engaged on is the ongoing measles outbreak in West [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=95.3s)]
*  Texas, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=99.66s)]
*  One of the worst measles outbreaks this country has seen in decades. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=100.66s)]
*  In fact, Kennedy this week personally visited the epicenter of the outbreak. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=102.66s)]
*  He attended the funeral of an eight-year-old child who's died of measles there, a second [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=106.22s)]
*  kid that this measles outbreak has killed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=110.94s)]
*  Kennedy then posted to social media photos of him visiting with the families who lost [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=113.5s)]
*  children to the measles, as well as two of the doctors who had been treating them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=118.38s)]
*  He called those doctors, quote, extraordinary healers. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=123.26s)]
*  He claimed they had, quote, treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken children using steroids [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=126.74s)]
*  and an antibiotic. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=134.38s)]
*  One of those doctors had touted the same steroid as a cure for COVID-19. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=138.5s)]
*  He said he had realized the steroid's life-saving potential thanks to divine intervention. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=143.5s)]
*  He discovered that this steroid was a cure for COVID-19. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=153.1s)]
*  He said, quote, while I was asleep, an answer to prayer came to me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=155.94s)]
*  Well, he thinks it cures COVID-19. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=159.62s)]
*  He now also thinks it cures measles. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=161.66s)]
*  It's the same medication. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=164.02s)]
*  I don't know if it was the same dream or whatever, but it's basically an asthma inhaler [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=165.78s)]
*  that he says cures COVID and cures measles. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=172.5s)]
*  And not to state the obvious, but asthma inhalers do not cure COVID-19 or the measles. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=175.38s)]
*  Dr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=180.18s)]
*  Philadelphia. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=184.58s)]
*  He tells NBC News that, in fact, steroids should not be given early in the course of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=185.62s)]
*  a viral infection like measles because steroids inhibit the immune system. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=189.66000000000003s)]
*  Quote, that's not what you want to do. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=193.82s)]
*  Your immune system works for you to fight measles. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=195.82s)]
*  But the I think that inhaled steroids from an asthma inhaler cure COVID and cure the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=200.9s)]
*  measles, that's one of the two doctors our nation's health secretary is endorsing for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=205.62s)]
*  his miracle working in this out-of-control measles outbreak. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=210.38s)]
*  The other doctor he's endorsing is a sort of rising star in the anti-vaccine movement [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=214.6s)]
*  mass infection with measles of the kind that we're seeing in this out-of-control outbreak [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=219.22s)]
*  in Texas is quote, God's version of measles immunization. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=224.06s)]
*  From an NBC News report this week, quote, Dr. Ben Edwards, a conventionally trained [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=229.18s)]
*  doctor who has shifted to promoting natural remedies and prayer, has been operating a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=232.78s)]
*  makeshift clinic in Seminole, Texas, offering children unproven treatments, including, according [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=237.56s)]
*  to a video posted by an anti-vaccine group, quote, while he himself said he was sick with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=243.38s)]
*  measles. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=249.22s)]
*  So just, I know I've just said the word measles a lot, but just focus in on this for a second. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=250.22s)]
*  What I'm saying here is actually what you think you heard. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=256.42s)]
*  This is a doctor who advises against the measles vaccine and who is promoting these quack treatments. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=259.26s)]
*  There is no treatment for measles, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=264.54s)]
*  There's supportive care so that you hopefully don't die from it, but there's no cure for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=266.06s)]
*  measles. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=270.86s)]
*  Antibiotics and steroids aren't a cure for measles. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=271.86s)]
*  But he's saying they're not promoting vaccination, instead promoting these quack treatments, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=275.94s)]
*  and he is treating patients in this largely unvaccinated community in Texas, and he is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=281.5s)]
*  doing so while he himself has the measles. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=286.7s)]
*  Activists from RFK Junior's anti-vaccine group, the one that he founded, went to this doctor's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  makeshift clinic in the middle of this measles outbreak, and standing there in his clinic [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  where he was seeing patients and their families, he told them on camera that he himself was [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=301.5s)]
*  in the midst of a measles infection. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=306.78s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=308.5s)]
*  You've got some measles to set? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=309.5s)]
*  Yeah, I was pretty anky yesterday. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=310.5s)]
*  Did you ever not have measles as a child? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=311.5s)]
*  No, I didn't have any more. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=312.5s)]
*  How many MMRs do you have? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=313.5s)]
*  I'd have to go back and look. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=314.5s)]
*  That doesn't work then, does it? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=315.5s)]
*  No, apparently not. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=316.5s)]
*  I'm just waiting for the vaccine to be approved. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=317.5s)]
*  I'm just waiting for the vaccine to be approved. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=318.5s)]
*  I'm just waiting for the vaccine to be approved. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=319.5s)]
*  I'm just waiting for the vaccine to be approved. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=320.5s)]
*  I'm just waiting for the vaccine to be approved. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=321.5s)]
*  You're an amazing human being, you know that? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=322.5s)]
*  You should know that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=323.5s)]
*  Thank God for you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=324.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=325.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=326.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=327.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=328.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=329.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=330.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=331.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=332.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=333.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=334.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=335.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=336.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=337.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=338.5s)]
*  I'm just a little bit of a wimp. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=339.5s)]
*  Just doing what any doctor should be doing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=340.5s)]
*  Again, that's a video from R.F.K. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=363.14s)]
*  Jr.'s anti-vaccine group that he founded. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=365.14s)]
*  I'll tell you, this is what the CDC says about the contagiousness of measles. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=369.9s)]
*  The CDC is an agency now run by R.F.K. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=374.9s)]
*  Jr. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  But if you ask them what about the contagiousness of measles, they will tell you, quote, if [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  you have measles, up to 90% of the people close to you who are not immune will also [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=381.7s)]
*  become infected. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=386.46s)]
*  You can spread measles to others from four days before through four days after the rash [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=387.46s)]
*  appears. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=393.08s)]
*  So there is this doctor in Texas who has active measles infection, who has spots on his face. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=395.28s)]
*  He has just come down with the rash, he says, the day before. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=401.2s)]
*  He is asking people in this highly unvaccinated community to bring themselves and their family [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  members in to see him while he himself has just sprung his own measles rash. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=408.52s)]
*  So you've got a guy who is basically a drinking fountain of measles in that very vulnerable [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=413.38s)]

*  Dr. Edwards declined comment to NBC News, but our nation's new Health and Human Services [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=423.5s)]
*  Secretary, he says that that Texas doctor, those two Texas doctors are, quote, extraordinary [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  healers. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=433.88s)]
*  This is unfolding as Secretary Kennedy has forced out the nation's top vaccine regulator. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  You may recall that when Dr. Peter Marx quit a couple of weeks ago, he submitted a resignation [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=441.76s)]
*  letter that called out what he called R.F.K.'s misinformation and lies. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=446.14s)]
*  In an interview with the Associated Press this week, Dr. Marx was more specific about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=450.88s)]
*  the reason he left. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=454.56s)]
*  There was a confrontation, quote, shortly before he was forced to resign, the nation's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=456.08s)]
*  top vaccine regulator says he refused to grant Health Secretary Kennedy's team unrestricted [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=460.0s)]
*  access to a tightly held vaccine safety database, fearing that the information might be manipulated [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=466.0s)]
*  or even deleted. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=471.04s)]
*  Dr. Marx agreed to give Kennedy's associates the ability to read thousands of reports of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=472.04s)]
*  potential vaccine-related issues sent to the government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=477.48s)]
*  System, but he would not allow them to directly edit the data. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=482.6s)]
*  Marx telling the Associated Press, quote, why wouldn't we? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=486.8s)]
*  Because frankly, we don't trust them, he said, using a profanity. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=489.72s)]
*  He said, quote, they'd write it over or erase the whole database. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=493.12s)]
*  So the nation's top vaccine expert says he was pushed out of the U.S. government because [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=497.44s)]
*  to stop RFK and his allies from corrupting the nation's database on vaccine safety. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=503.72s)]
*  And now at an all-for-show cabinet meeting in the White House this week, RFK told the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=512.96s)]
*  cameras and told President Trump that he's going to announce to the nation the cause [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=517.76s)]
*  of autism by September of this year. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=523.6s)]
*  Now that he's pushed out the vaccine expert and gotten access to the vaccine safety database, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=527.58s)]
*  oh, and put an anti-vaccine crank in charge of the, quote, unquote, study he's going to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=532.24s)]
*  do on the totally repeatedly debunked supposed link between vaccines and autism. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=537.52s)]
*  I wonder what he's going to say causes autism. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=543.36s)]
*  As for Kennedy's claim that he is going to have this whole autism thing sorted out in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  just a few months, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network says in a statement that it, quote, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  demonstrates his disregard for scientific studies as, quote, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=557.28s)]
*  As for the people who do remain at HHS now, how are things going for them? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  Quote, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  Last color comments about children with developmental disabilities. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=586.8s)]
*  FDA employees gathered at the agency's headquarters for a viewing party to watch the FDA commissioner [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=589.92s)]
*  and HHS secretary who spoke from a separate room in the same building. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=596.24s)]
*  The meeting quickly turned to warnings of the deep state and the influence of the CIA, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  according to audio and transcripts obtained by Bloomberg News. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=605.28s)]
*  Kennedy told HHS staff, quote, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=608.56s)]
*  supposed to regulate. He said, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=616.8s)]
*  Like, say, people who discover miraculous cures for pandemics in their dreams, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=624.16s)]
*  and then it turns out they think it's the cure to everything. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  Or people who say that instead of the historic public health victory that we've had off mass [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=634.88s)]
*  measles vaccination, we should instead go with God's version of measles immunization, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=639.52s)]
*  which is just everybody gets measles. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=644.24s)]
*  People like, you know, the guys who set up clinics for unvaccinated measles patients [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=648.32s)]
*  and their families and then treat them while they themselves are infected with measles, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=653.84s)]
*  one of the most contagious viruses on the planet. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=660.32s)]
*  Yeah, for too long, such people have been turned away by America's health agencies, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=664.16s)]
*  but not anymore. Apparently now they get to destroy the U.S. government's health agencies [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=668.72s)]
*  and take over themselves. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJQUQJnUOI0&t=675.28s)]
