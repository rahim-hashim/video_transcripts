# 'Kill the gays' law in Uganda tests Biden admin with huge amounts of aid money at stake
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4)
*  So here's an update for you, sort of a provocative one. You may remember that earlier this year, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=0.0s)]
*  in a country called Uganda, they passed a kill the gays law, a law that among other things imposes [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=4.64s)]
*  the death penalty for something called aggravated homosexuality. When that was signed, the Biden [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=11.36s)]
*  administration said they were revolted. They very forcefully came out against it. They said the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=17.12s)]
*  White House would reevaluate the way the U.S. engages with that country because of it. Well, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=21.92s)]
*  the big high dollar way that our country engages with them is a universally respected American [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=27.44s)]
*  program called PEPFAR. It's a huge sustained initiative to fight AIDS and save lives. It's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=33.68s)]
*  one of the unilaterally uncomplicated good things the United States has ever done in Africa. PEPFAR [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=39.6s)]
*  absolutely works. But in May, in light of the new law with the death penalty for being gay, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=45.6s)]
*  the Biden administration said it would reassess its funding of that program. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=53.2s)]
*  It has not played out that way. So far, the White House has made no changes. A senior administration [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  official told NBC News last week that for now, the program will continue as is, that the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  administration will, quote, reassess on an ongoing basis the ability to deliver the PEPFAR funding [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=67.68s)]
*  and how, but again, no changes for now. Now, the people who support PEPFAR, the people who have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=74.0s)]
*  been champions of it, many of whom also work with African human rights groups, they're calling on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=80.32s)]
*  the Biden administration to change things, to change the way they provide this funding. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=84.88s)]
*  This is hundreds of millions of dollars in this one program each year. It's a ton of money. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  And if nothing changes, that funding will go specifically to officials who have led and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=96.16s)]
*  championed this new law, which promotes the extermination of gay people in Africa, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  which is, which the Biden administration has said it is furious about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  This also comes at a time when this may spread beyond Uganda. Kenya and Ghana and Tanzania and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=112.64s)]
*  a number of other African countries are looking to adopt similar kill the gays laws targeting [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=118.48s)]
*  their country's LGBTQ citizens. The other context here is that Uganda has tried something like this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  before. They passed legislation similar to this in 2014. It was met with massive resistance within [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=130.8s)]
*  the country itself, but also from the Obama administration at the time and under pressure [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=136.4s)]
*  from the Obama administration at the time, Uganda back in 2014 back down. This time, Uganda is going [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  ahead and they think the Biden administration is going to let them and that they're going to keep [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=148.0s)]
*  getting all the assistance they've ever had from the United States with no changes and no strings [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  attached. The Biden administration said it would reassess this relationship. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=157.44s)]
*  So far, they're not. What will the consequences be? If any, this time around, will they keep their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=162.16s)]
*  word? Confounding situation here. Watch this space. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWL7Hq-sCm4&t=168.24s)]
