# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 5
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo)
*  BJ Pack, in his first lengthy interview since resigning a year ago, says that he had never [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=0.0s)]
*  been a fearful fellow. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Quote, but I figured if they're storming the Capitol, Lord knows what people will do. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=7.12s)]
*  Mr. Pack testified in August before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the atmosphere surrounding [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  the White House at the time and about the unrelenting pressure from Trump's team. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=16.5s)]
*  Pack recalled telling the acting Deputy Attorney General at the time, quote, well, that seems, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=20.8s)]
*  that's very, that's crazy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  That's just highly crazy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=28.46s)]
*  The Deputy Attorney General agreed saying it was bat shoot crazy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=30.62s)]
*  I don't think he said bat shoot, but it's a family paper. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=35.02s)]
*  What was so crazy? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=39.22s)]
*  Well, it was during a phone call December 30th or 31st, 2020, when the Deputy Attorney [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=40.22s)]
*  General told BJ Pack that a Trump loyalist in the Justice Department wanted to enlist [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=46.28s)]
*  DOJ's help to overthrow the election in Georgia. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=51.14s)]
*  The official wanted to send a letter to Georgia's legislators urging them to throw out the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=54.66s)]
*  presidential electors and consider installing a new slate citing significant concerns about [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  the election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=64.3s)]
*  Among those significant concerns were allegations of fraud that had already been debunked, like [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=65.3s)]
*  the so-called suitcases of illegal votes found election night in Fulton County, Georgia. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=70.06s)]
*  BJ Pack knew state election officials and the FBI had already shot down that claim of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  fraud. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=80.44s)]
*  In fact, as U.S. Attorney, he knew of no confirmed fraud in the state. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=81.64s)]
*  At that moment, BJ Pack told me, quote, excuse me, at that moment, BJ Pack told me, meaning [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=86.88s)]
*  the columnist writing this article, the scary reality of the situation sank in, quote, one [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  thing I wasn't aware of until then was how far along they were with this plan and how [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=96.88s)]
*  far they were trying to go. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=102.2s)]
*  BJ Pack resigned because he was basically forced to because the plan from the Trump [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=106.84s)]
*  White House, from President Trump himself, was to use fake, made-up fraud claims in Georgia [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=113.16s)]
*  that BJ Pack had investigated and knew were false. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=119.36s)]
*  The plan was to use those false claims as a pretext to justify having Georgia recall [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  its electors and declare that Trump had won that state instead. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=127.36s)]
*  One year ago in Georgia, as Georgia voters went to the polls in those two crucial U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=132.5s)]
*  Senate races, the day before the U.S. Capitol attack, we now know that's what was happening [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=136.82s)]
*  behind the scenes in Georgia, precipitating, among other things, the dramatic and at that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=142.38s)]
*  time unexplained resignation of that state's U.S. Attorney. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=148.34s)]
*  Here's the question, though. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=152.86s)]
*  How illegal was all that? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=154.7s)]
*  Again, this was before the January 6th attack. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=156.62s)]
*  How illegal was that other part of it, separate and apart from the violent attack on the U.S. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=160.62s)]
*  Capitol January 6th? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=165.94s)]
*  I mean, there is a criminal investigation underway by state prosecutors in Georgia investigating [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=168.22s)]
*  whether President Trump broke Georgia state law when he called Georgia election officials, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=172.3s)]
*  when he told the Secretary of State to find enough votes in Georgia to declare that Trump [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  was the winner. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=181.46s)]
*  There's some recent sort of murky public reporting about a lower-level Georgia election worker [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=182.46s)]
*  being pressured by people connected to the Trump campaign, pressured that she needed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  to concoct a false confession. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=191.7s)]
*  She needed to falsely confess that she had carried out fraud in the election in Georgia [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  or else she'd find herself and her family in danger. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  Threatening and intimidating election officials, coercing them to try to get them to falsify [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=204.54s)]
*  the election results or pervert the administration of the election, that is a crime under Georgia [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  state law. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=213.26s)]
*  We know there is a Georgia state criminal investigation that's been underway in that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=214.26s)]
*  state in Fulton County for months now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=217.82s)]
*  I should note that threatening and intimidating election officials to try to get them to falsify [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  election results isn't just a state crime in Georgia, it's a crime everywhere. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=225.5s)]
*  It's a federal crime. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  But we don't know about any federal investigation into the actions of former President Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=231.34s)]
*  and the Trump campaign's behavior along those lines in Georgia. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=235.62s)]
*  Maybe there is one, but we don't know about it if there is. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  What about what BJ Pack got roped into? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=244.66s)]
*  The reason he was forced to resign. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=247.42s)]
*  Which he's now describing both in his Senate testimony and to the press. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=251.7s)]
*  What about this effort to use false claims of voter fraud as a pretextual justification [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=255.64s)]
*  for Republican legislatures declaring that the vote in that state didn't count and they [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=260.86s)]
*  were going to invent new election results of their own and say that Trump won? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=264.82s)]
*  Is that a crime? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=268.5s)]
*  Is that criminal? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  It's a conspiracy to overthrow the US government for sure. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=272.5s)]
*  Is that a crime? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=275.36s)]
*  Does anybody get prosecuted for trying that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=277.64s)]
*  And I mean this literally regardless of what happened a year ago tomorrow at the US Capitol. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=281.8s)]
*  Had there not been violence at the US Capitol on that one day on January 6th as part of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=286.72s)]
*  this plan, would the rest of the plan have been okay? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=291.36s)]
*  You know, have fun throwing out the election results you guys. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  Better luck next time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  Get more ducks in a row next time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=298.68s)]
*  Make sure there aren't any guys like BJ Pack around next time who think this is bull bleep. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=300.12s)]
*  You'll need guys who will just go along. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=305.8s)]
*  So make sure you get that in order next time because feel free to try again. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=307.32s)]
*  Is that how we're going to handle what happened in our country last year? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=310.8s)]
*  Peter Navarro, Trump advisor who was so desperate for attention it hurts my mouth to say his [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=316.56s)]
*  name. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  This guy did an interview with my colleague Ari Melber here on MSNBC last night. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  He has done recent interviews along the same lines with the Daily Beast and also with Rolling [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=328.28s)]
*  Stone. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=331.96s)]
*  He's also written a ridiculous new book. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=332.96s)]
*  And in all of those interviews and in his book, he claims credit for all the aspects [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=335.28s)]
*  of the coup they were trying to pull off except for the violence on January 6th. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=339.52s)]
*  He says it was him and Steve Bannon and President Trump. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=343.96s)]
*  And they had this plan to hype these gossamer fantastical claims of supposed fraud in order [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=346.68s)]
*  to create a justification for Republican state legislators to throw out the vote in those [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=353.44s)]
*  states and just proclaim Trump the winner instead. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=357.4s)]
*  That was what they needed Mike Pence to effectuate for them on January 6th. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=360.96s)]
*  Don't count the electoral votes as they have been submitted by the states. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=366.56s)]
*  Instead say you won't count them or throw them out or send it back to the state somehow [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  so we can get different electors. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=374.0s)]
*  Mr. Navarro is publicly making the rounds admitting to this because he says the violence [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=378.44s)]
*  at the Capitol January 6th wasn't part of that plan. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=383.96s)]
*  That was a little blooper. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=386.52s)]
*  That was a little messy overboil on the stove that they didn't intend. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=387.52s)]
*  He's making the public rounds now saying the coup attempt to throw out the election results [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=392.0s)]
*  and thereby keep Trump in power. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  It was for real. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=398.0s)]
*  He says it involved a hundred Republican senators and members of Congress and it absolutely [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=399.0s)]
*  would have worked if it weren't for that pesky riot. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=403.76s)]
*  That was such a distraction from their real effort to overthrow the government of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=409.24s)]
*  United States. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=412.84s)]
*  Is he right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=416.28s)]
*  Is everything except the breaking windows and trashing congressional offices and beating [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  up cops? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=423.17999999999995s)]
*  Is everything except that cool? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=424.28s)]
*  Try again. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  Welcome to it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  That was fine. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Arlen today explaining that 150 misdemeanor cases have already been [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=432.2s)]
*  resolved related to people who took part in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=436.64s)]
*  Those have already been resolved with defendants pleading guilty. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=441.52s)]
*  He said 17 felony defendants are already scheduled for trial. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=443.68s)]
*  More than 300 other people are today stand indicted on felony charges. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=447.32s)]
*  He's laying all that out, as you just heard there, to make the case that small fry defendants [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=452.44s)]
*  always go first. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=457.64s)]
*  That's on purpose. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=458.76s)]
*  People who did worse crimes, less overtly obvious crimes, they come later in part because [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=460.04s)]
*  the easier to prosecute stuff often provides evidence that you can use in other cases. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=465.46000000000004s)]
*  Helpful. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=472.68s)]
*  But still, the basic question remains. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=474.32s)]
*  Is he only talking about crimes that were physically committed at the U.S. Capitol building [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=477.22s)]
*  on January 6th between the hours of 2 p.m. and dinner time that day, a year ago tomorrow? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=481.68s)]
*  Or does this investigation include, is there a criminal investigation into those who hatched [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=488.26s)]
*  the overall plot, not the plot to break windows and smear poop on the walls, the plot to stop [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=494.16s)]
*  the electoral count and keep Trump in power? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=499.64s)]
*  Because that's what all the January 6 folks were doing in Washington. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=502.2s)]
*  They believed they were part of a larger plot, and indeed they were. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=505.64s)]
*  And lots of people are happily confessing now to having been part of that larger plot [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=509.28000000000003s)]
*  or to witnessing it when the president tried to enlist them in it, what B.J. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=513.3s)]
*  Pack saw them try to do in Georgia, what Peter Navarro was happily confessing to live on [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=517.16s)]
*  MSNBC on a Tuesday night, what Trump and his colleagues did to try to get the mob to D.C. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=522.24s)]
*  on January 6th in the first place, because January 6th was the counting of the electoral [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=527.36s)]
*  votes and they needed to stop that count so the electors could be switched in the states, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=531.68s)]
*  which was the rest of the plan. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=536.04s)]
*  What about that rest of the plan? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=538.76s)]
*  Was that cool? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=540.22s)]
*  Getting Republican state legislatures whatever gossamer or false pretext they needed to throw [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=542.76s)]
*  out election results and instead replace them with, we're just going to say Trump won. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=548.5799999999999s)]
*  Because that was a real plan and we know a lot more about that plan today than we did [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=554.48s)]
*  a year ago. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=558.24s)]
*  Did Attorney General Merrick Garland today let the country know if that other part of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=561.4s)]
*  it was okay? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=566.48s)]
*  We know they're prosecuting people who broke windows and did bad stuff in the Capitol. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  Did he let the country know today whether the rest of it, the rest of the plot to overthrow [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=573.44s)]
*  the U.S. government was all right and anybody who did that is free to try again? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=578.36s)]
*  And I am phrasing this as a question because I honestly don't know. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=583.28s)]
*  What do you take away from how he said this today? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=589.4s)]
*  As judges have sentenced the first defendants convicted of assaults and related violent [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=593.0799999999999s)]
*  conduct against officers, we have seen significant sentences that reflect the seriousness of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=597.28s)]
*  those offenses, both in terms of the injuries they caused and the serious risk they posed [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=603.56s)]
*  to our democratic institutions. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=610.66s)]
*  The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=614.54s)]
*  The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators at any [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=620.9s)]
*  level accountable under law, whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=628.12s)]
*  responsible for the assault on our democracy. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=635.54s)]
*  We will follow the facts wherever they lead. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=639.46s)]
*  The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators at any [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=644.3s)]
*  level accountable under law, whether they were present that day or otherwise criminally [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=650.46s)]

*  Or does he mean people who are otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=667.46s)]
*  our democracy, as in the assault on the election and its results, the effort to falsify those [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=670.58s)]
*  results and thereby seize power? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=674.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=677.34s)]
*  I don't know what he means. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=679.26s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Senator Chuck Schumer joins us live now. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=682.74s)]
*  Senator Schumer, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=686.62s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=688.5400000000001s)]
*  Good evening, Rachel. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  Good to be back on. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=690.5400000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you, we have a lot to talk about, but let me ask you first about those remarks [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=691.5400000000001s)]
*  today from Attorney General Garland. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  I wanted to just get your response to what he said about the investigation into the crimes [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=698.0s)]
*  that culminated on January 6th at the Capitol and what he said about Congress's need to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=703.4s)]
*  act on voting rights. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=707.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, first, in terms of the invasion of the Capitol, that was one of the darkest moments [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=709.72s)]
*  in American history. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=715.78s)]
*  It was an attempt to actually change the government illegitimately, which we don't see in a democracy, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=716.78s)]
*  using violence. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=723.84s)]
*  And I just hope they throw the book at these people. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=725.36s)]
*  I don't know the specific cases. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=727.76s)]
*  I don't know how the exact law applies to each case. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=729.96s)]
*  But when I read sometimes that they've gotten probation or a short period of time in jail, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=733.6s)]
*  it bothers me a great deal. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  So I believe the Justice Department is ramping it up and they're looking at the perpetrators [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  who led the charges. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=747.38s)]
*  And I hope they will do everything they can to prosecute them to the fullest extent of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=748.64s)]
*  the law. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=752.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, the second question, he's exactly right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=754.68s)]
*  We can prosecute these people, but make no mistake about it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=756.16s)]
*  January 6th was not a one-off. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=759.76s)]
*  It stemmed from the big lie perpetrated by Donald Trump. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=762.12s)]
*  This invasion of the Capitol didn't just come sui generis. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=766.88s)]
*  He urged people to come. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=770.64s)]
*  He urged people to march on the Capitol. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=771.84s)]
*  Many of them who went into the Capitol believed he was urging violence. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=773.84s)]
*  But the same big lie that created January 6th by Donald Trump is also importuning legislatures, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=777.76s)]
*  Republican legislatures throughout the country to dramatically curb the right to vote and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=787.28s)]
*  not just everybody's right to vote, but specifically people who tend to vote Democratic, whether [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=793.08s)]
*  it be people of color or poor people or people who live in big cities or young people, people [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=798.84s)]
*  on campuses. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  So this is a dagger aimed at the heart of our democracy. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=805.22s)]
*  And the two, January 6th and what's going on in the legislatures, are directly related [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=809.62s)]
*  and all stem from Donald Trump's big lie. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  The only way to curb this second perpetuation of the big lie is for Congress to act. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=818.1800000000001s)]
*  He's absolutely right. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=824.9s)]
*  Because of that connection between the pretext for the January 6th attack and the pretext [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=828.1s)]
*  for these voting rights restrictions that you just described, that the attorney general [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=834.74s)]
*  described today, I wonder what you make of the fact that a number of Republican senators [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=838.26s)]
*  voted to impeach Donald Trump for what happened on January 6th, voted to impeach him for his [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=845.02s)]
*  role in inciting that attack on the Capitol and that effort to overthrow the election. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=849.34s)]
*  And yet even those senators will not vote to protect voting rights against attacks that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=853.34s)]
*  are undergirded by the same claims. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=858.98s)]
*  If these things are in fact connected, why are Republicans who recognize one side of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=862.44s)]
*  that not recognizing the other? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=866.6s)]
*  Well, we're in a different Republican Party than we used to be. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, voting rights, Rachel, used to be very bipartisan. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=871.6s)]
*  Ronald Reagan supported extension of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=875.6s)]
*  George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush supported it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=878.8000000000001s)]
*  And when it used to come up in the Congress, it got large margins. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=881.48s)]
*  What's happened is this is a new Republican Party. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=884.9200000000001s)]
*  And this is a fact we're impressing on all of our colleagues, all 50 of our colleagues. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=887.2s)]
*  It's a different Republican Party run by Donald Trump. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=891.96s)]
*  And the fidelity to elections, the fidelity of democracy is no longer there. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=896.2800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump the other day endorsed Orban. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=900.6s)]
*  This man's a dictator who is undoing whatever democracy Hungary had. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=903.32s)]
*  And I believe his beliefs are similar. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=908.52s)]
*  It's his own ego. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=910.48s)]
*  He wants to just dominate. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  And he doesn't care about our democracy, our history, about the rights of people to vote. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=913.72s)]
*  And by the way, so that is all the Republicans, almost every single one of them, even those [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=920.56s)]
*  seven who bravely voted to impeach him, are no longer bucking Donald Trump. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=925.52s)]
*  They've almost all given up. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=930.16s)]
*  The ones the ones who some of them have quit. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=932.04s)]
*  I think five Republicans aren't running again. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=934.6s)]
*  And my guess is more than my guess. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=936.68s)]
*  My understanding is a good number of them quit because they didn't want to serve under [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=938.84s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=942.28s)]
*  But no one no one on that side of the aisle seems to be bucking him on this issue. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=943.28s)]
*  And it's a tragedy. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=947.92s)]
*  One of the things that has emerged in the last few days is that the Republican leader, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=951.48s)]
*  Mr. McConnell, has reportedly suggested that he is open to one small piece of the package [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=957.52s)]
*  of reforms and the package of protections that you and your colleagues in the Biden [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=966.8s)]
*  administration support in terms of protecting voting rights, that he is potentially open [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=970.52s)]
*  to supporting reforms to the Electoral Count Act to try to prevent the limited procedural [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=976.1600000000001s)]
*  shenanigans that gave them their their theory of the case in terms of why the why the Capitol [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=982.0s)]
*  attack happened on January 6th. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  I just wanted to get your reaction to that apparent movement from Senator McConnell just [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=990.36s)]
*  on that one piece of those reforms and protections that you've been pushing for. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=995.52s)]
*  Well, there's no let me say this. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  I think that what they're trying to do is try to substitute that for the very needed [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1001.9200000000001s)]
*  reforms that we have urged undoing what the state legislatures are doing throughout the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1007.48s)]
*  country. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1013.48s)]
*  And so it's sort of like saying, well, I'm going to rig the game, but then I'll make [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1014.48s)]
*  sure you count the score accurately. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1018.72s)]
*  What the hell is the point if you rig the game to count the score accurately? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1020.84s)]
*  So that's point number one. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1024.32s)]
*  Point number two, it doesn't deal with the House or Senate. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1025.96s)]
*  The Electoral College only elects the president. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1028.48s)]
*  So it has nothing to do with any elections in the House and Senate, which are trying [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1031.0s)]
*  which they're trying to rig into jaundice. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1035.52s)]
*  And third, what they're trying to do is accomplish things in a different way. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1038.0s)]
*  Donald Trump wanted Pence to rig the election. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1042.08s)]
*  This law might say, well, let's let the state legislatures rig the election. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1046.6s)]
*  Neither is good. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1051.36s)]
*  So I think this is a fake. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1052.48s)]
*  I think it's a way to try and get the two senators that we have who are not on board [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1054.72s)]
*  to go for something that won't change the horrible, voracious change in the balance [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1060.72s)]
*  of power that will allow elections to slam things in the directions of Republicans in [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1067.84s)]
*  a dramatic way, an unfair way and an unsmoldy democratic way. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1072.44s)]
*  And I'm opposed to it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm opposed to allowing it to be the subject of this conversation. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1078.92s)]
*  I want to talk about that later and reform the Electoral College fine, but it's no substitute [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1082.68s)]
*  for what we have to do. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1087.0800000000002s)]
*  And in terms of what you have to do, you've put a you've put a specific timeline on this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  now. You've said that by the Martin Luther King holiday, by a week from Monday, you want [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1093.6000000000001s)]
*  to vote on potentially changing the Senate rules or carving out some sort of exception [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1098.8s)]
*  from the way the Senate rules are right now in order to be able to pass the voting rights [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1104.28s)]
*  protections that you support. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  Tell me about the decision to to put that specific timeline out there to create that [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1109.76s)]
*  expectation about when this is going to happen. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1114.04s)]
*  Tell me about your confidence that you're going to be able to get the vote that you [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1116.2s)]
*  want. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, first, we're running out of time. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1120.48s)]
*  What these legislatures have done in twenty twenty one and are now beginning to do in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1123.76s)]
*  twenty twenty two. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1128.0s)]
*  If you wait much longer, you won't be able to undo them in time for the twenty twenty [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1129.28s)]
*  two elections, even if the even if the legislation says what they did is wrong. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  The courts may say it's too close to the primary season. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1137.84s)]
*  We can't change it. So we have to move quickly. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1140.68s)]
*  But second, requiring a vote on both rules changes and on the actual legislation, the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1143.56s)]
*  Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act says to each of my 50 senators. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1151.52s)]
*  You are going to have to make a decision. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1158.48s)]
*  The spotlight of history is on you. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1160.9199999999998s)]
*  Are you going to side with the forces that are dramatically undoing our elections, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1163.6799999999998s)]
*  preventing the right to vote a giant step backwards, certainly in the last 50 years, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1168.56s)]
*  maybe even longer in terms of our democracy, or are you going to do the right thing? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1173.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think when the spotlight of history and the weight of history is on the shoulders [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  of all 50 members, the hope is that they do the right thing. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1185.8s)]
*  Is there a guarantee? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1190.12s)]
*  No, but we were going to have to have a vote. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1191.32s)]
*  Have to and we will. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOuGxKqQ8Eo&t=1193.96s)]
