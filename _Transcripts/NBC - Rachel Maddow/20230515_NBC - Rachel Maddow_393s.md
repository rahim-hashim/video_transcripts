# Durham report, long-awaited by Trump supporters, fails to deliver on hype
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM)
*  A second thing we are keeping an eye on tonight is the reaction, particularly the reaction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=0.0s)]
*  on the political right to the long awaited Durham report. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=4.16s)]
*  What? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=9.52s)]
*  The long awaited what? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  Well, the reason we're watching for the right and their reaction to this is because the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=12.32s)]
*  Durham report is only really long awaited by them and they really, really have been [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=16.6s)]
*  awaiting this report. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=21.94s)]
*  A source close to special counsel John Durham's probe tells Fox News things have, quote, accelerated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=25.12s)]
*  I look forward to Bull Durham's report. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=31.8s)]
*  That's the one I look forward to. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=36.56s)]
*  Did you think by now that there would have been more to come out of the Durham investigation? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=39.32s)]
*  What happened to Durham? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=46.1s)]
*  Where's Durham? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=47.36s)]
*  And by the way, where's Durham? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=48.36s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=50.92s)]
*  Where is he? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=51.92s)]
*  He disappeared. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=52.92s)]
*  We do not yet know what the remainder of John Durham's findings are. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=54.24s)]
*  Actually now we finally do know. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=60.28s)]
*  Boy, they have been excited about this for a long time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=61.96s)]
*  Literally for years, former President Trump and his allies have been invoking the name [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=64.76s)]
*  John Durham, or sometimes Bull Durham, as the man who would save them and smite all [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  of Trump's enemies. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=76.48s)]
*  For years they have been heralding the great revelations John Durham would soon reveal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=77.92s)]
*  about Trump's political opponents and the deep state and all their evil ways. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=82.56s)]
*  When that didn't seem to be happening, Trump and his allies started pounding their chests [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=88.08s)]
*  and yelling at the clouds about why Durham hadn't acted yet, why he hadn't yet smote [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=92.64s)]
*  all of Trump's enemies, why, you know, there were Democrats who weren't yet at Guantanamo. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=97.64s)]
*  Durham will do it all. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=104.36s)]
*  John Durham was appointed by Trump Attorney General Bill Barr. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=106.12s)]
*  His assignment from Bill Barr was to prove that when Russia launched its operation to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=109.6s)]
*  intervene in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 to try to help Trump win, Durham was [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  supposed to prove in this investigation that the FBI was wrong to have investigated whether [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=122.28s)]
*  the Trump campaign itself was connected to what Russia was doing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=129.32s)]
*  For four long years, John Durham's supposedly bombshell findings were always tantalizingly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=134.32s)]
*  close. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=140.44s)]
*  The damning evidence was going to come any day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=141.44s)]
*  It has really never worked out the way they hoped. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  In some total, what John Durham got out of his investigation was one guilty plea out [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=148.64s)]
*  of an FBI lawyer, an FBI employee, who admitted he made a misrepresentation in a single email. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=154.4s)]
*  It should also be noted, though, that that lawyer's screw-up was discovered not by John [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  Durham but by an entirely different investigation that had nothing to do with John Durham. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  Nevertheless, that FBI employee did plead guilty to making a misrepresentation in a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  single email, and his punishment was that he had to do some hours of community service. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=177.0s)]
*  But that was kind of it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  Last year, John Durham finally did bring two criminal cases to court stemming from his [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=185.88s)]
*  investigation. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=190.0s)]
*  He lost both of those cases in very quick acquittals. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=191.64s)]
*  In one of those two cases, the forewoman of the jury actually came out of the courtroom [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  after the case and told reporters outside that the trial had not been worth the effort. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=200.0s)]
*  She said, quote, I think we could have spent our time more wisely. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  After the second not guilty verdict, this was the AP's headline, quote, Trump's claim [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=209.98s)]
*  of crime of the century fizzles in three-year probe. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  But that was OK, because that was only year three. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  And the smoking gun was going to be in Durham's report, which we know now would come out in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=222.28s)]
*  year four. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=226.04s)]
*  The report was still coming, right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  John Durham's failed cases in court, they were all just part of the deep state conspiracy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=230.48s)]
*  When he finally put the report out, all would be revealed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=235.64s)]
*  Today at long last, we have the report. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=240.32s)]
*  Here's the AP's headline today, quote, prosecutor ends probe of FBI's Trump, Russia, and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=243.48s)]
*  investigation with harsh criticism, but no new charges. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=249.44s)]
*  Quote, the report Monday from special counsel John Durham represents the long awaited culmination [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  of an investigation that Trump and his allies had claimed would expose massive wrongdoing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=257.4s)]
*  by law enforcement and intelligence officials. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=263.04s)]
*  Instead, Durham's investigation delivered underwhelming results. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=265.8s)]
*  Nearly four years, more than $6 million in taxpayer funds. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=271.6s)]
*  And today's report, now that we've got it, it's 300 plus pages. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=275.52s)]
*  It's just a rehash of stuff we already knew, with Durham criticizing the FBI for launching [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=279.96s)]
*  that investigation, but presenting no new evidence that they actually did anything wrong. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=285.2s)]
*  And so it is worth keeping an eye on the reaction to this report today on the right, because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=293.24s)]
*  who knows how they're going to react. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=298.88s)]
*  They do seem kind of trapped in this hype letdown, hype letdown cycle. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=300.08s)]
*  Just a few days ago, the Republican chairman of the Oversight Committee, you may remember, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=304.12s)]
*  he held this big press conference to announce the bombshell corruption evidence he had turned [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=308.04s)]
*  up about President Biden. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=312.64s)]
*  How did that go? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=315.4s)]
*  Well, this was the headline in the New York Times about that press conference. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=316.56s)]
*  Quote, House Republican report finds no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=320.04s)]
*  After months of investigation and many public accusations of corruption against Mr. Biden [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=324.68s)]
*  and his family, the first report of the premier House Republican inquiry into such matters [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=328.24s)]
*  showed no proof of such misconduct. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=333.52s)]
*  But that's okay. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=337.76s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=338.76s)]
*  There's still more to come. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=339.76s)]
*  This weekend, the same chairman, the House Oversight Committee chairman, said his investigation [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=340.76s)]
*  still has more evidence. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=345.34s)]
*  Okay, there might not have been anything in that report last week, but there's more. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=346.68s)]
*  He said he has an informant on all of Biden's corruption. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=350.24s)]
*  Only he admitted to Fox News this weekend he has temporarily misplaced the informant. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=354.12s)]
*  He cannot find him anymore. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  It's possible he might have left him on the top of the car when he pulled out of the driveway [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=362.48s)]
*  and he just disappeared. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  It's got to be here somewhere. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=367.56s)]
*  Can't find the man anywhere. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehk9JYdhfqM&t=369.32s)]
