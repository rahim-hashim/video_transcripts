# Historic 'Little Rock Nine' school pushes back on Arkansas law limiting race studies
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA)
*  Sarah Huckabee Sanders has been governor of Arkansas for a little more than seven months, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=0.0s)]
*  which is not that long, but boy, she hit the ground running. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=6.16s)]
*  If you think the big problem with America is that we have child labor laws, well, she's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=9.0s)]
*  taking care of that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=13.76s)]
*  Governor Huckabee Sanders immediately got to work as a new governor, getting rid of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  those, making it easier to put Arkansas children to work doing adult jobs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Kids younger than 16 used to need a state permit to verify their age and grant them [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=24.84s)]
*  permission to work. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=29.0s)]
*  The governor now says that permit put an arbitrary burden on parents. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=30.0s)]
*  So that burden is lifted. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=35.56s)]
*  Let's get your 14 year old to work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=37.2s)]
*  Also Governor Huckabee Sanders rolled out an interesting online application for anybody [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=40.6s)]
*  who wanted to be on an Arkansas state board or commission. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=45.46s)]
*  The application to be on a state board or commission included this prompt for a 500 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  word essay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  What is an accomplishment of the governors that you admire the most? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=55.48s)]
*  That's a requirement to be on a official state commission of any kind in Arkansas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=61.8s)]
*  You have to put together 500 words on what you love about the governor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=67.56s)]
*  Governor's office blamed a design error for that essay prompt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=73.4s)]
*  The governor also got right to work, kicking thousands of people off their health insurance [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=78.32s)]
*  in Arkansas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=82.32s)]
*  More than a quarter of the people who were kicked off their health insurance were dropped [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=83.44s)]
*  off of it for procedural reasons, meaning they didn't get their paperwork in time, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=87.08s)]
*  in time or something. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  It means that thousands of families, thousands of kids, all of whom had health insurance [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=93.76s)]
*  before are now kicked off. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=98.12s)]
*  So they now don't have health insurance. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  That said, maybe the kids can get insurance at their new slaughterhouse jobs. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=104.0s)]
*  As for the school part of being a kid in Arkansas, high schoolers in that state are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=109.6s)]
*  now starting to feel the effect of a bill that Governor Huckabee Sanders signed this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  year, which among other things, bars Arkansas teachers from teaching about race and racism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  This law went into effect August 1st. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  Just days later, the Arkansas Department of Education announced that the AP African American [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=129.76s)]
*  Studies course will no longer count toward graduation credits in Arkansas this year because [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=134.67999999999998s)]
*  it might amount to indoctrination. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  Now I should tell you that of the six Arkansas high schools that had planned to offer AP [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=144.32s)]
*  African American Studies, all six of the schools have decided to offer the course anyway, even [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=150.04s)]
*  though the state says it won't count. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=155.27999999999997s)]
*  One of those schools that is defying the governor, defying the state on this is Little Rock Central [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=158.56s)]
*  High, which is going ahead with AP African American Studies. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=163.8s)]
*  And never mind the objections from Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders's office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=167.16s)]
*  Little Rock Central High is, of course, the exact same school where nine brave black students [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=172.32s)]
*  attended class for the first time in 1957. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=177.92s)]
*  This is a time when the country was supposed to have desegregated our schools. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=181.4s)]
*  But boy, they had not in Little Rock. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=184.72s)]
*  And those kids had to be escorted to class, shielded from an angry, violent mob by members [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=186.84s)]
*  of the Army and the National Guard. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=192.52s)]
*  Those nine kids, the Little Rock Nine, hold a signal place in African American history, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=196.0s)]
*  in American history, but particularly in African American history, which will be taught this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  year at the advanced placement level at their high school. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=206.68s)]
*  We often say history rhymes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=211.96s)]
*  We say history repeats, but sometimes history is just a linear, direct rerun. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iFthKBRpfA&t=213.52s)]
