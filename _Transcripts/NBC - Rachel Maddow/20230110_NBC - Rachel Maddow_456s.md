# U.S. far right becomes shameful model for anti-democracy insurrectionists
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA)
*  However surprised we might have been as a country when that happened in January 2021, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=0.0s)]
*  the American right wing had been showing us for months all over the country that that's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=7.08s)]
*  the way they plan to operate from here on out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in 2020, they sent armed mobs out to government sites in Michigan, in Idaho, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=13.16s)]
*  in Pennsylvania, in Oregon, in Arizona, in Georgia, you name it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=21.48s)]
*  And they sent them into state capitals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=25.8s)]
*  They sent them to the offices of statewide officials. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=27.5s)]
*  They sent them to the homes of statewide officials, always with guns, always with force. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=29.64s)]
*  And now, even as the national expression of this tactic in Washington, D.C., January 6, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=39.44s)]
*  2021, even as that has been successfully adjudicated in federal court as an act of sedition, and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  as upwards of a thousand people have been criminally charged for their participation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=52.32s)]
*  And again, the national version of this tactic from January 6, 2021. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=56.32s)]
*  Now we are starting to see how this looks when this American right wing tactic gets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  translated into foreign languages and foreign countries. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=67.56s)]
*  It was only last month when German police arrested more than two dozen people who they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  say were planning a similar armed right wing attack on the German parliament. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=75.72s)]
*  They were well armed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=81.16s)]
*  They were fairly well connected. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=82.16s)]
*  When a former member of parliament from a right wing party was among those arrested, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=83.44s)]
*  it was thought that her access to the parliament building as a former member might have been [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=87.04s)]
*  used to get these armed attackers inside the Reichstag on the day of their planned assault. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=92.64s)]
*  Now this month, it's Brazil, where Trumpy right wing former president Jair Bolsonaro [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=99.64s)]
*  lost his bid for reelection on the last day of October. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=106.28s)]
*  The timeframe is almost exactly the same from when Trump lost reelection in early November [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=110.34s)]
*  2020, and then his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol the first week of January. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=115.58s)]
*  Bolsonaro lost reelection the last day of October, and now his supporters have attacked the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=120.54s)]
*  national Capitol the first week of January as well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  Bolsonaro, like Trump, said in advance of the presidential election that the election [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=128.74s)]
*  was rigged, that the only way he could lose is through fraud. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Like Trump, Bolsonaro said in advance that he would only accept the election's results [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=137.46s)]
*  if he won. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=141.18s)]
*  Like Trump, Bolsonaro then lost, and like Trump, Bolsonaro then refused to concede. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=143.66s)]
*  He also refused to go to his successor's inauguration, just like Trump did. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  When Bolsonaro's supporters attacked their national Capitol yesterday, it was like watching [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=153.82s)]
*  a Southern Hemisphere, Southern performance, Southern Hemisphere summer performance of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=158.9s)]
*  the January 6th attack. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=163.66s)]
*  The images and videos coming out of the Brazilian Capitol were so uncannily similar to what [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=166.7s)]
*  we saw here at home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=171.22s)]
*  And the pro-Bolsonaro mob attacked journalists and stole and smashed journalists' equipment, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=174.06s)]
*  just as the pro-Trump mob did on January 6th. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=180.78s)]
*  The Bolsonaro mob used police barricades as battering rams. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  They attacked police officers in bloody hand-to-hand combat. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=188.42s)]
*  They ransacked the offices of members of the Brazilian government. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=191.94s)]
*  They took selfies and posed in government chambers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=197.18s)]
*  Just like Trump did, Bolsonaro waited silently for hours as the attack was underway. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=202.5s)]
*  He only put out a statement calling for peace once the security forces had regained control [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=207.3s)]
*  of the Capitol and repelled the invasion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=211.78s)]
*  Bolsonaro's family and supporters, just like Trump's, soon started claiming that it wasn't [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=214.14s)]
*  them at all who attacked the Capitol. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=219.34s)]
*  It was bad guys. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=221.22s)]
*  It was left-wingers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=222.22s)]
*  It was Antifa criminals dressed up like Bolsonaro's supporters. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=223.22s)]
*  It wasn't really Bolsonaro supporters who did all of this ransacking and who trashed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=227.58s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=232.82s)]
*  I mean, the parallels are so tight, it's almost stupid. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=233.82s)]
*  It almost just seems like reading the same script in a different language. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=237.54s)]
*  And seeing English language hashtags trending online about the attack, seeing English language [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=245.38s)]
*  signs at the attack in a country where they speak Portuguese, not English. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=253.34s)]
*  I mean, it tells you something about how this may be more than just inspired by what happened [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  here in our own right-wing attempt at a violent government overthrow. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  But there's also some important differences. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=269.34s)]
*  Like, for example, in Brazil, they actually arrested people on the day of the attack. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=271.54s)]
*  More than 1,000 people arrested yesterday, unlike our own Capitol attack on January 6th, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=276.46s)]
*  in which almost no one was arrested until well after it was all over and most of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=281.74s)]
*  attackers had gone home. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=285.54s)]
*  In Brazil's case, they've got more than 1,000 people in custody today from yesterday's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=287.02s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=291.9s)]
*  Also, in Brazil's case, they launched this attack a week after the transfer of power [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=292.9s)]
*  had already happened. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=296.9s)]
*  Not before the transfer of power, like happened with the Trump supporters in D.C. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=298.5s)]
*  Because the new president of Brazil has already been sworn in and Bolsonaro is already an [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=304.5s)]
*  ex-president, that has all sorts of implications for the former president, Bolsonaro, and whether [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=308.34s)]
*  he's going to be held responsible for what his followers just did. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=313.66s)]
*  Bolsonaro, bizarrely, is in Florida right now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=317.46s)]
*  Since the day that he left office, he has been staying at a weird little suburban McMansion [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=321.58s)]
*  near Disney World, which he rented from a mixed martial arts fighter. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=327.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=331.5s)]
*  The State Department spent today fending off requests from reporters about what exactly [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  Bolsonaro is doing here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=337.1s)]
*  Is he here to try to avoid prosecution on the numerous corruption probes and other forms [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=339.3s)]
*  of criminal investigations that he's facing in Brazil? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=344.70000000000005s)]
*  The State Department is fending off questions today about, you know, what kind of visa Bolsonaro's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=348.58000000000004s)]
*  on and what's going to happen if, in fact, he faces charges at home. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=352.54s)]
*  And Brazil asked the United States to extradite him to face trial there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=355.74s)]
*  We're also tonight learning that, even more weirdly, the official in the Brazilian government, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=360.94s)]
*  who is the security chief specifically responsible for security in Brasilia, in their national [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=367.74s)]
*  capital, he was also in Florida at the time the attack on the capital happened this weekend. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=373.74s)]
*  He has since been fired from the Brazilian government, as of today. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=382.1s)]
*  What was he doing in Florida when the attack took place? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=386.98s)]
*  Why is he still there now? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=389.22s)]
*  We have a lot of challenges. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=392.26000000000005s)]
*  But on top of it all, we now need to content with the fact that at least Florida appears [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=394.86s)]
*  to be developing as a refuge for would-be dictators for whom the violent efforts of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=398.62s)]
*  their supporters were not quite enough to keep them in power. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=403.22s)]
*  Florida is apparently lousy with that kind of overripe fruit right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=407.18s)]
*  And we need to contend with the fact that whether or not the world still sees us as [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=412.14s)]
*  a beacon of democracy, a city on the hill, the far right around the world apparently [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=416.02s)]
*  now sees our far right as a model for violent mass attack against the institutions of government. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=421.58s)]
*  I mean, as Americans, we take great pride in leading the world in lots of things. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=428.66s)]
*  We do not take great pride in this. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuEKcnvgeYA&t=433.66s)]
