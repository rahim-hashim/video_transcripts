# Maddow: 'Don't sleep on what is happening in the states'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I)
*  So, like I said, there's lots to watch between the two campaigns. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=0.0s)]
*  And it is understandable in presidential election years that all eyes are on that top-level [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  contest between the two major parties and their presidential candidates. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=9.48s)]
*  But in a presidential election year like this, with just two months to go until the big day, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  may I also suggest that you don't sleep on what is happening in the states? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=21.34s)]
*  Yes, watch the two major parties. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=25.92s)]
*  Yes, watch their two candidates. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Yes, watch the way the presidential campaigns fight each other and the nuances of how they [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=29.08s)]
*  compete. But watch what is happening in the states, because sometimes, even in an election [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=33.36s)]
*  year, what is happening in the states just seems like it can't possibly actually be [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=41.12s)]
*  happening. For example, how is this for a local news lead this weekend in Michigan? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=45.2s)]
*  Things got off to an odd start at the Michigan Republican Party convention in Flint today. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=52.68s)]
*  Former Michigan GOP chair Christina Caramo was escorted out of the event by police. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=60.04s)]
*  Yes, that is an odd start. Things did get off to an odd start. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=66.2s)]
*  You know, even if this weren't the state Republican Party and one of the most important swing states [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  in the country in a presidential election year, yes, that does sound like an odd start for the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=76.72s)]
*  Michigan Republican Party state convention. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=82.16s)]
*  Former Michigan GOP chair Christina Caramo, who was ousted from leadership, made an appearance [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=87.56s)]
*  at the event but was removed by Flint police. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=93.44s)]
*  New chair Pete Hoekstra was greeted by some boos as he took the stage. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=98.88s)]
*  We've had problems in this state party. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=103.4s)]
*  Officials say she was asked to take a seat but refused and was also asked to leave but [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=106.0s)]
*  refused again. That prompted law enforcement to get involved, escorting her out of the building [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=110.88s)]
*  for, quote, causing a disruption and clogging up the floor. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=116.52s)]
*  Causing a disruption and clogging up the floor. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  Detroit news reporter Craig Mauger was able to capture this view of the former state [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Republican Party chair being escorted out of the state Republican Party convention by [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  police. It was followed by some pushing and shoving, maybe even a little punching. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to tell exactly what is going on there, but clearly something that is not politics is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=142.6s)]
*  happening here as police are called in to remove from the state Republican Party convention [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=149.44s)]
*  the woman who claims she still is the chair of the Michigan Republican Party. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=154.56s)]
*  She was elected in 2023. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  She was removed in January 2024 this year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=161.2s)]
*  She then refused to go in February. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=164.28s)]
*  A Michigan court ruled that she had to go. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  As of the summer, she was still trying to get courts to reinstate her as Michigan Party chairman. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  And as of this weekend, the cops were called in to get her out when she appeared on the floor of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=174.12s)]
*  state party convention. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=180.12s)]
*  Did I mention that this is one of the most important states in the country for the presidential [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=182.8s)]
*  race and we're two months out from the presidential election? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=187.36s)]
*  The ostensible state chairman is almost booed off the stage as she tries to convene their state [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=190.04s)]
*  convention and the person who claims she's still the real party chair is escorted out by police. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=195.92s)]
*  I mean, it's been months now that in the Michigan State Republican Party, they've been calling the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=205.48s)]
*  cops on each other and getting in fistfights at their official Republican Party events. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=210.64s)]
*  We pay so much attention to how the two parties presidential campaigns are doing, competing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=216.64s)]
*  against each other in various like swing state polls, you know. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's worth noticing when things are absolutely bananas with one of the parties in those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  states. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=229.88s)]
*  And it is not only happening in one state. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=231.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, not long after the Michigan Republican Party went to war with itself and ousted its chair [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=235.16s)]
*  and she refused to go and she took them to court and nobody knew who was running the place. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=240.44s)]
*  Not long after that, aversion to the same thing also happened in the state of Florida. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=244.36s)]
*  Right after Michigan threw out their state Republican Party chair, Florida threw out theirs too, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=248.36s)]
*  following news reports that he was being investigated by police for allegations of rape. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Police also said they were investigating him for video voyeurism charges for allegedly [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=261.44s)]
*  illegally recording a sexual encounter without consent. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=266.76s)]
*  The Florida Republican Party threw him out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  They police later cleared him of charges in both of those investigations. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=272.76s)]
*  But then right on the heels of that, the state of Arizona lost their state Republican chair to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  that same Republican Senate candidate who awkwardly appeared with with Trump this weekend, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=284.72s)]
*  Carrie Lake. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=289.8s)]
*  She released secretly recorded audio tapes of the Arizona state Republican chairman, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=290.48s)]
*  in which she said he was trying to bribe her to leave the Senate race. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=296.8s)]
*  She also reportedly threatened to release more tapes of him. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  And so he quit as Arizona State Republican Party chairman. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=304.8s)]
*  Then right on the heels of that, the National Republican Party lost its chair to Ronald [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=309.56s)]
*  Romney McDaniel, pushed out or resigned, apparently in order to make room for Donald Trump's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=315.16s)]
*  daughter in law. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=320.68s)]
*  Her experience in the Senate was a little bit more complicated than the rest of the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  her experience for the job included being a singer in addition to being married to one of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=326.24s)]
*  Trump's sons, the blonde one. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=331.44s)]
*  So that seemed like a totally legit, non-controversial meritocratic choice for the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=333.36s)]
*  leadership of the National Republican Party. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=337.76s)]
*  And so Ronald Romney McDaniel had to go. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  But all of that has all happened just this year in twenty twenty four. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=344.16s)]
*  It's only August. But I mean, Michigan, Florida, Arizona, the National Republican [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=348.8s)]
*  Party, they all lost their top leadership under embarrassing, if not terrible [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=354.72s)]
*  circumstances, all in a crucial election year. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  And now it's happened again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=364.44000000000005s)]
*  This time it has happened in Colorado. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=366.48s)]
*  We start tonight with some big news in Colorado politics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=370.8s)]
*  The state's Republican Party chairman is out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  Dave Williams and other party leaders were voted out as leadership of the Colorado GOP [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=377.16s)]
*  today. But those party leaders have said they consider today's meeting and vote fake. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=382.0s)]
*  The meeting started at noon and is still going right now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=387.08s)]
*  Republican Party members are voting on who will now lead the state party. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=389.88s)]
*  Nine News reporter reporter Lawrence Scaffidi has been there all day. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=393.76s)]
*  It's two and a half months until Election Day in Colorado. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=398.4s)]
*  Republican Party members are still fighting their own leader. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=401.12s)]
*  And to those who say, you know, don't change a writer in the middle of a race. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=404.79999999999995s)]
*  That's that's a valid argument, unless, of course, the writer is trying to kill the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=410.24s)]
*  horse. That is a valid argument, unless the writer is trying to kill the horse. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  So that was this weekend, Saturday, as Colorado Republican Party officials met to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=421.8s)]
*  vote out their state party chairman, who they said was destroying the party. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=428.08s)]
*  Now, for his part, it's a little bit like what happened in Michigan. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=432.72s)]
*  The Republican Party chair in Colorado is refusing to recognize the validity of the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=436.64s)]
*  vote to remove him because, of course, he is. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=441.96s)]
*  He says the meeting this Saturday in Brighton, Colorado, where they voted to fire him, he [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=445.52s)]
*  says it was, quote, a sham and illegitimate and illegal. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=450.4s)]
*  As of Sunday, the day after they voted to fire him, he at least still had custody of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=455.55999999999995s)]
*  the state Republican Party letterhead on which to release his statement that said his [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=460.28s)]
*  firing was a sham and so he's still in charge somehow. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=464.44s)]
*  So that's something maybe possession is nine tenths of the law. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=468.68s)]
*  Right. Maybe you still are kind of the state Republican Party chairman if you still [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=471.16s)]
*  possess some eight and a half by eleven letterhead that has your name on it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=476.44s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, who knows? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=480.64s)]
*  One person who says she is still the chair of the Republican Party in Michigan was [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=484.32s)]
*  escorted out of that party state convention by cops this weekend while fists flew. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=489.36s)]
*  Another person who says he is still the chair of the Republican Party in Colorado was [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=494.24s)]
*  voted out by the other Republicans. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=498.64s)]
*  But he says their vote doesn't count and he has the letterhead to prove it and he's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=500.24s)]
*  still the real chair and he'll convene his own meeting this upcoming weekend. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  And then everyone will see who's really in charge. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't it seem like a great idea to put those folks and that party in charge of the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=512.24s)]
*  whole country? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcNrL27KT8I&t=516.72s)]
