# What to expect from the prosecution of Donald Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec)
*  How's this for coincidence? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=0.0s)]
*  The actual arraignment Tuesday afternoon is scheduled to happen in a courtroom on the 15th floor [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=1.6s)]
*  of the criminal court building in lower Manhattan in New York City. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=7.44s)]
*  It will be in a room of that courthouse with a very specific kind of resonance for former president Donald Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Because in 2021, Donald Trump's business was charged with a whole slew of criminal fraud charges. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=17.6s)]
*  And that trial took place not only in the same courthouse where Trump is set to be arraigned, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=25.44s)]
*  but the trial for his organization, the trial for his company, was held literally in the exact same courtroom [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=31.28s)]
*  where we believe Trump is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday. Same room, same place. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  In that trial, Trump's business was found guilty, among other things, of falsifying business records, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=43.52s)]
*  which is at least reportedly one of the same charges that Trump himself is going to face [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=50.32s)]
*  in his criminal trial, which again will happen in the exact same room. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=54.32s)]
*  It's going to be a trip down memory lane for the former president on Tuesday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=59.36s)]
*  He's going to step into that courtroom to face charges of falsifying business records [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=62.64s)]
*  where his own business was just convicted of falsifying business records just a few months ago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=66.88s)]
*  It will also be familiar to his lawyer, Trump's lawyer in this case, Susan Necklis. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  She's the same lawyer who defended Trump's business in that criminal trial last year. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=77.6s)]
*  That did not go well for the defense. There were convictions on all counts. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  But who knows? Maybe that was a dry run for her. Maybe the first Trump business [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=87.52s)]
*  fraud trial helped prepare her for this next Trump fraud trial. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=91.2s)]
*  What kind of defense should we expect to hear, though, against these kinds of charges? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=96.72s)]
*  I suggested yesterday that we should expect this trial, based on what kind of charges we think [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  are going to be brought here, we should expect this trial to be very boring. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=105.52s)]
*  Is that fair? What should we, the public, be paying attention to as this kind of trial plays out? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=109.36s)]
*  Joining us now is a man who knows. His name is Mark Agnifilo. He's a former assistant Manhattan [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  District Attorney, same DA's office bringing these charges against Trump. He's also a former [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=120.4s)]
*  federal prosecutor. And also, he has quite recently defended clients in court who've been [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  charged with falsifying business records. These same charges were expecting to be brought against [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=130.16s)]
*  Mr. Trump. Mr. Agnifilo, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=134.72s)]
*  Oh, thanks for having me, Rachel. I really appreciate it, too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=138.88s)]
*  So I'm not a lawyer, and I know this is not going to be the Gwyneth Paltrow case. I know [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  there's not going to be cameras in the courtroom and us following it in that kind of a way. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=147.04s)]
*  But for those of us, and I think a lot of Americans who are going to be following this case closely, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=151.44s)]
*  should we expect a falsifying business records case, by definition, to be boring and or hard [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=156.48s)]
*  to follow? Or is this the sort of thing that we lay observers are going to be able to understand? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=163.52s)]
*  So the charge itself is really fairly simple. There has to be a business record that's been [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  falsified. For the trial to involve felony charges, there has to be a second intent to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  intend to commit another crime. So the charges are pretty boring. I don't know that any trial [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=181.12s)]
*  with Michael Cohen as a witness is going to be all that boring. But the charges are really [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=186.96s)]
*  fairly pared down. There's not a lot for the DA's office to have to prove. They have to prove that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=191.12s)]
*  there was a business record, it was false, and that there was a secondary intention to commit [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=197.84s)]
*  some other crime. They don't have to prove that another crime was committed or even attempted, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  just that there was an intent to do that. And to be clear, we don't know what the exact [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=210.72s)]
*  charges are. There is reporting about the number of charges. There is some reporting from the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  Associated Press about there being at least one felony charge among the—but again, we don't know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=220.56s)]
*  We'll know for sure when we see the indictment unsealed. But in the absence of that specific [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=226.16s)]
*  information, what do you think that we should expect? If it is something along the lines that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=231.2s)]
*  people are proposing or supposing, that it's going to be somewhere between two dozen and three dozen [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=236.4s)]
*  charges, a single felony or a small number of felonies among a larger number of charges that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=241.84s)]
*  aren't felonies, what would you expect in terms of the kind of timeline for a trial like this to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=247.68s)]
*  spool out? So I've had quite a number of these trials. The DA's office brings these counts all [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  the time. What I tend to see—I don't know if we're going to see this in this case—is there'll be [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=261.52s)]
*  some overarching either conspiracy count or a scheme to defraud count, and then the individual [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  false business record counts would be part and parcel of those larger counts. I don't know that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=274.08s)]
*  that's what they're going to do here. They don't have to do that here. It's unusual, though, in my [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  experience, to see these false business records counts without an overarching, you know, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=286.88s)]
*  usually felony, usually some type of larceny scheme or scheme to defraud or some sort of conspiracy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=294.08s)]
*  and then the business record counts are sort of part of those larger counts. So we'll all have to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=302.56s)]
*  see. You know, we're all speculating, what is that second crime? You know, is it an election-type [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=308.32s)]
*  crime? Is it something else? And we just won't know until the indictment's unsealed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  Mark, let me ask you about one other aspect of this. I was struck—the New York Times has a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  justice correspondent named Charlie Savage who's really smart and I think sees around corners a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  lot of times. I've followed his work for a really long time, and one of the things that he [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=329.36s)]
*  sort of contended and got some expert advice from, got expert advice on today in the Times, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=333.6s)]
*  was the idea that even though this is the first indictment of Donald Trump, there are a couple of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=338.88s)]
*  other active criminal investigations that could result in criminal charges against him in other [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=343.92s)]
*  jurisdictions, including potentially federally. And what Charlie Savage was suggesting at the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=349.68s)]
*  Times is that even though this might be the first indictment, the way the New York courts work, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=354.16s)]
*  particularly around white-collar offenses like this, this might not be the first one that actually [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=360.0s)]
*  ends up in trial in front of a jury because he suggested that in the New York court system, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  the courts are essentially set up to deal with a lot of pre-trial appeals, a lot of pre-trial [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=371.36s)]
*  motions, a lot of things that could delay the actual start of the trial. And if Donald Trump [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=376.48s)]
*  finds himself federally indicted or indicted in Georgia, one of those things might get to trial [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=381.44s)]
*  first. Do you think that seems like a fair contention given your experience in the New [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=385.6s)]
*  York courts with charges like this? It's certainly possible. I mean, one of the things, one of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=389.68s)]
*  features about New York state practice that you don't have federally is you have meaningful motions [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=394.96s)]
*  against the grand jury proceedings themselves. You don't really have that in federal court. So [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=400.96s)]
*  so Trump's lawyer is going to be able to argue to Judge Murchand, hey, the evidence they put in [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  the grand jury is legally insufficient. This indictment should be dismissed. In the federal [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  courts, the grand jury is this black box. You don't get to see into it. In New York state courts, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=417.84s)]
*  you do. And so the motion practice in state courts a little more, a little more important, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=422.4s)]
*  a little more involved. And as a result, it's a longer timeline of motions. So I would expect [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=427.76s)]
*  this trial to be, you know, maybe a year from now. I think it's it's everyone's going to be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=434.88s)]
*  watching it. I think Judge Murchand is is not going to want it to just linger. But a year is [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=441.2s)]
*  probably a safe guess in terms of a timeline. Federal cases very often get to trial sooner [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=447.36s)]
*  than that, sometimes six months, eight months. So if there is a federal indictment of Trump in the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=452.56s)]
*  next, say, month or two, it's possible that case would get the trial before this one. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=459.76s)]
*  You have materially increased my amount of information about this, this and helped me [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=466.0s)]
*  understand it in a way that I did not before. Thank you for that clarity. It's really just [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=471.2s)]
*  invaluable. Mark Agniflo is a former assistant Manhattan District attorney, former assistant [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=475.28s)]
*  U.S. attorney, somebody who's dealt with these types of cases in these courts. Sir, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=480.24s)]
*  thank you so much for being here. It's really helpful. Anytime. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLISKSU0aec&t=484.32s)]
