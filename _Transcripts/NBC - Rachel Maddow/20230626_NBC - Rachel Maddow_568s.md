Video Description: CNN reports it has obtained the audio of the 2021 meeting at Donald Trump's Bedminster club at which Trump makes it seem as though he is sharing secret information that he is aware he cannot declassify as an ex-president. Rachel Maddow shares key pieces of that audio, including some that was not included in the portion transcribed in Trump's indictment. The Rachel Maddow Show has reached out to Trump's legal team and campaign for comment but so far we have heard nothing back.

# Hear audio of Trump discussing classified documents published by CNN
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU)
*  But we actually have to start tonight with some breaking news related to the special counsel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=0.0s)]
*  indictment of Trump on those classified documents charges. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=5.76s)]
*  When special counsel Jack Smith brought those 37 federal criminal charges against Trump earlier [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  this month in the classified documents case, remember these were charges for willful retention [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=16.48s)]
*  of national defense information at his home in Florida, also false statements and obstruction. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=21.84s)]
*  You might remember in the indictment there was sort of at length detail given of a supposed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=28.32s)]
*  audio recording of Donald Trump. Oh lordy, there are tapes. According to the indictment, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=36.08s)]
*  there is a tape from July 2021 when Trump was at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=42.64s)]
*  And according to the indictment, Trump in this recorded conversation, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=49.04s)]
*  he's allegedly speaking with a writer who's working on a book about the Trump administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=53.68s)]
*  And according to the indictment, during that conversation, Trump seems at least to show this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=58.72s)]
*  writer some documents that he says are classified. Now, you can't do that. A, you shouldn't have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=66.72s)]
*  classified documents after you leave the presidency. But B, you shouldn't be able to show them ever to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=74.24s)]
*  somebody who's not got proper security clearances and a need to see them. The indictment quotes from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=80.16s)]
*  this supposed tape. It describes Trump showing the writer a piece of paper and allegedly saying, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=87.28s)]
*  quote, I just found, isn't that amazing? It's like highly confidential secret. This is secret [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=94.16s)]
*  information. As president, I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=100.08s)]
*  secret. It's crazy, right? I mean, if you were inventing, like, cartoon level, you did it wrong [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=106.56s)]
*  allegations for somebody mishandling classified information, you'd like this, you'd dream this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=118.0s)]
*  up as a hypothetical to teach 1L law students, right? Imagine there was a tape in which the, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=123.84s)]
*  which the accused said, no, I'm not supposed to be showing this to you. It's really secret. But look, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=129.76s)]
*  here it is. And it's just a prosecutor's dream to have something like this on tape. But all we could [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=136.56s)]
*  see in the indictment was prosecutors allegation that this tape existed and that on this tape, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=144.4s)]
*  Trump said those things. And, you know, as an allegation, it's damning the special counsel's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=150.96s)]
*  alleging that Trump improperly held on to classified information here, allegedly was this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=158.72s)]
*  description of audio evidence of Trump appearing to admit that he was in possession of secret [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=164.16s)]
*  material, that it's not declassified, it's classified material, and he's nevertheless [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=169.04s)]
*  showing it to people who are absolutely not cleared to see it at this meeting at his golf course. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=173.68s)]
*  Thanks to the indictment, we've all read the transcript of that supposed recording. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=180.0s)]
*  But now tonight, we can all hear it. Because CNN tonight and kudos to them for nailing this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=186.64s)]
*  CNN tonight has obtained the audio recording of Donald Trump, in which he appears to tell [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=194.32s)]
*  a writer that he is knowingly in possession of classified material. Now, I should tell you that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=201.52s)]
*  this is CNN's reporting. NBC News has not authenticated this recording. But if what CNN [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=206.16s)]
*  has obtained is legit, what it appears to be is the tape that's described in the indictment, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=214.4s)]
*  the evidence that helped lay the groundwork for special counsel Jack Smith to indict Donald Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=220.96s)]
*  So here it is. I'm going to play the whole thing for you now. Listen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=228.24s)]
*  Milley, let me see that. I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=250.4s)]
*  Iran. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=258.32s)]
*  This was him. They presented me this. This is off the record. But they presented me this. This was [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=265.52s)]
*  him. This was the Defense Department and him. We looked at some. This was him. This wasn't done by [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=272.16s)]
*  me. This was him. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Let's see here. Isn't that amazing? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=278.72s)]
*  This totally wins my case, you know. Except it is like highly confidential, secret. There's a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  secret information. Look at this. You attack and... Hillary would print that out all the time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=299.12s)]
*  She'd send it to Anthony Weiner, the pervert. By the way, isn't that incredible? I was just saying [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=306.32s)]
*  because we were talking about it. He said he wanted to attack Iran and what. He said it was [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  fake. This was done by the military, given to me. I think we can probably... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=322.48s)]
*  See, as president, I could have declassified. Now I can't, you know. But this is declassifying. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? It's so cool. Look, we heard... And you probably almost didn't believe me, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=341.04s)]
*  but now you believe me. It's incredible, right? Hey, bring some, bring some cokes in, please. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=348.4s)]
*  Bring some cokes in, please. That does give it at least the ring of authenticity, doesn't it? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=355.84s)]
*  I'll show you an example. Look. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Look. This was the Defense [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=362.64s)]
*  Department. All sorts of stuff. Pages long. Look. This is secret information. Look. Look at this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=369.52s)]
*  He wanted to attack Iran. These are the papers. Trump has since tried to say in subsequent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=379.2s)]
*  interviews, there was no document. I wasn't showing anything. It was just newspaper articles [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=385.84s)]
*  and magazine articles. This was the Defense Department. These are the papers. This was done [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=390.0s)]
*  by the military and given to me. I think we can probably write staffer. I don't know. Well, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=396.96s)]
*  we'll have to see. Yeah, we'll have to... Trump, declassify it. Trump. See, as president, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=402.88s)]
*  I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is classified. Isn't that interesting? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=408.32s)]
*  It's so cool. Can we get some cokes? I mean, let's just drill down on the specifics of this for a [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=413.12s)]
*  second. In Jack Smith bringing charges against Donald Trump, the sort of crux of the case, right, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=422.24s)]
*  is that the prosecution has to be able to prove that Trump had classified documents in his [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=430.56s)]
*  possession after he left the presidency, right? That's the illegal activity alleged in the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=437.2s)]
*  indictment. And here in this part of the tape is Donald Trump saying he had possession of classified [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=443.12s)]
*  information after leaving the presidency. Except it is like highly confidential. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  Contradential, secret. This is secret information. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=457.44s)]
*  Highly confidential. This is secret information. This is secret information. Look, look. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  Look at my secret information. It's one thing to sort of read these words as part of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=469.76s)]
*  indictment. It's another thing to hear it. Another key part of Jack Smith's case against Trump is [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=474.4s)]
*  proving not only that Trump had these documents in his possession, but that he knew [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=480.0s)]
*  it was no longer in his power as an ex-president to declassify them, right? So again, part of his [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=487.44s)]
*  sort of purported defense or part of his attempted defense, if you could even call it that, it doesn't [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=495.2s)]
*  even seem that coherent, is to say, yes, these things were classified, but I used my mind [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  to declassify them. Here he is on tape admitting that he does not have the power to declassify [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=507.44s)]
*  these things, and these are still classified. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=513.44s)]
*  As president, I could have declassified it. Now I can't, you know, but this is classified. Isn't [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=525.84s)]
*  that interesting? It's so cool. It's a lot of things. I'm not sure cool is like in the top 6,000, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  but this is definitely the kind of thing that sounds like it should end up in a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=539.28s)]
*  federal criminal indictment. I'll give you that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1smUbV6PvU&t=544.0s)]
