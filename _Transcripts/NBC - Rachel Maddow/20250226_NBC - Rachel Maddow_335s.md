Video Description: Elon Musk, Donald Trump's top campaign contributor, made a lighthearted joke about his federal workforce cuts damaging the U.S. ability to guard against an Ebola outbreak. Despite Musk's assurances that any damage done was quickly remedied, experts insist the cuts continue to leave the U.S. unprepared. Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency room doctor and Ebola survivor, talks with Rachel Maddow about what Musk's cut have really done.

# 'We will regret this': Cuts leave U.S. vulnerable to Ebola, contrary to Musk assurances
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4)
*  We will make mistakes. We won't be perfect. But when we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=0.0s)]
*  So, for example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally cancelled very briefly was Ebola prevention. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=7.0s)]
*  I think we all want Ebola prevention. So we restored the Ebola prevention immediately. And there was no interruption. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=15.0s)]
*  That's not true. Today, Donald Trump's top campaign donor claimed during a weird, like, filmed-for-TV cabinet meeting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=22.0s)]
*  that although he had accidentally, in his role as Donald Trump's top campaign donor, ended all Ebola prevention efforts of the U.S. government, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=31.0s)]
*  after they realized that's what had happened, it was restarted, it was just a very brief interruption, and it all could—or not even an interruption. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=41.0s)]
*  It was very briefly stopped but then restarted without interruption. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=49.0s)]
*  People who actually work on these matters for the U.S. government and in this field say none of this is true. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=53.0s)]
*  Public health experts, including current and former USAID officials, say that the Ebola prevention efforts were hobbled, that they've not been restarted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=59.0s)]
*  In 2014, you might remember, there was an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=71.0s)]
*  Doctors from the United States went to countries like Guinea to go track cases and treat patients. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=75.0s)]
*  A doctor named Craig Spencer was one of those doctors who responded to that outbreak, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=80.0s)]
*  and he became the first person in New York City to test positive himself for Ebola in October 2014, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=85.0s)]
*  after he was abroad treating Ebola patients in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=92.0s)]
*  Ebola has a really high mortality rate. It kills more than half the people it infects. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=98.0s)]
*  In Dr. Spencer's case, he had 19 days in the hospital, but he survived. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=102.0s)]
*  Today, he wrote this in response to Elon Musk's remarks about Ebola prevention being accidentally stopped but then started back up again with no interruption. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=106.0s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=116.0s)]
*  Normally, the U.S. would have helped set up border screening and other measures on the ground, but this time we didn't. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=132.0s)]
*  Normally, we would have spoken with the WHO about helping end the outbreak, but this time we didn't because CDC staff weren't even allowed to talk to them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=138.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Craig Spencer. He's associate professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown University School of Public Health. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=149.0s)]
*  He's also the New York City emergency room doctor who survived Ebola after treating Ebola patients in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders nearly about a decade ago now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=155.0s)]
*  Dr. Spencer, I really appreciate you being here tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=164.0s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=167.0s)]
*  So it's always good to see you because you had Ebola. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=170.0s)]
*  And so anytime that I see you, I feel like I have hope that these sorts of things can be survived. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=173.0s)]
*  These horrific, these horrific diseases. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=179.0s)]
*  I have to ask what your reaction was to seeing Elon Musk today bring up Ebola unprompted, laugh about it and then suggest that while he had accidentally cut off all U.S. government efforts to combat it, everything was fine now because it had all been restarted without interruption. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, Rachel, I was remarkably confused because for the past month I have been talking to people who normally would have responded to this Ebola outbreak in Uganda, the Marburg outbreak in Tanzania. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=199.0s)]
*  And guess what? They didn't. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=210.0s)]
*  For the last decade, I have followed every single outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=212.0s)]
*  I know everyone that is doing this. I know where they're responding. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=217.0s)]
*  I know the people in Uganda at the Ministry of Health. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=220.0s)]
*  I've heard from people who normally would be supported by our country, by our government to set up border screening, to do the contact tracing on the ground. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=224.0s)]
*  They're not getting paid. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=233.0s)]
*  Countries are asking them to work for free because USAID normally would have supported them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=235.0s)]
*  Here in this country alone, we normally would have sent people almost immediately once these outbreaks are declared. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=239.0s)]
*  Guess what? We didn't do this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=245.0s)]
*  And the result is right now people around the world are looking to the United States saying, what are your commitments? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=248.0s)]
*  What is true about your support? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=254.0s)]
*  What Elon Musk said today was just categorically untrue. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=256.0s)]
*  We did not get rid of Ebola prevention and then put it back in place. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=260.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and Doze were responsible for actively and actually stripping off the letters of the USAID, the agency from its headquarters in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=265.0s)]
*  On the first day of this administration, Donald Trump signed an executive order to pull the United States out of the World Health Organization. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=277.0s)]
*  And just very recently, hundreds of CDC workers, those frontline doctors and epidemiologists who would be responding to outbreaks like Ebola abroad, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=285.0s)]
*  Ebola in the United States and other infectious threats that you've just highlighted, 750 of those people were let go. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=295.0s)]
*  Regardless of what Elon Musk and others say, we have set ourselves up to be very sorry for an infectious threat. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=302.0s)]
*  Maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe next year. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=309.0s)]
*  But I've been saying over and over again, we will regret this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=311.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk9igZMaER4&t=315.0s)]
