# Exclusive: Rep. Santos describes assassination attempt, mugging in new video
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE)
*  So at the top of the show, I went through a long but definitely not exhaustive list of the known [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=0.0s)]
*  lies of freshman Republican Congressman George Santos of New York. You're probably familiar with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  some of the greatest hits by now, the volleyball star and Wall Street fortune and all that stuff, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  right? But here's something you have not heard before. Did you know that Congressman George [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=16.72s)]
*  Santos also claims he was the target of an assassination attempt, which required him being [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=21.2s)]
*  put under official police protection? That is what George Santos claimed last month in an interview [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=26.88s)]
*  with a Brazilian podcast. The podcast is called Radio Novello Apresenta. Forgive my pronunciation, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=33.36s)]
*  Radio Novello Apresenta. They shared this video from the interview exclusively with us. So you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  won't see this anywhere else, but I want you to see it. In this interview, then-Congressman-elect [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  George Santos is speaking with the hosts in Portuguese. So we have subtitled it. He starts [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=53.04s)]
*  off talking about an alleged act of vandalism, which he says was targeted at him simply because [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=59.36s)]
*  he's a Republican. But then in the midst of that, he says, oh, also someone tried to murder him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=64.72s)]
*  We have already suffered an attempt on my life, an assassination attempt. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=83.04s)]
*  There was an assassination attempt, really. Then-Congressman-elect George Santos did not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=113.04s)]
*  elaborate on his claim in the interview. We have tonight reached out to Congressman Santos' office [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=119.2s)]
*  to get more information about him saying that he was the victim of an attempted murder, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  getting New York police protection at his home as a result. There ought to be a record of that sort [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=131.44s)]
*  of thing if it happened. We've inquired about this claim from him. We have not heard back. We do live [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=135.44s)]
*  in hope. Mr. Santos did offer more detail about a different act of violence he says was committed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=139.52s)]
*  against him. In this interview with the same Brazilian podcast, he said he was the victim of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=145.44s)]
*  a very, very, very brazen mugging in the middle of the day in the middle of one of New York City's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  busiest thoroughfares. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=158.48s)]
*  It is surreal what we live through here. Yes, surreal is one word for it. I love that the podcast host [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=188.48s)]
*  interrupts him there. Santos says, it was 3 in the afternoon. I was leaving my office, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=216.96s)]
*  going to the garage, getting my car, and I was mugged. They robbed me, took my briefcase, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=221.84s)]
*  took my shoes and my watch. The host then interrupts him and says, they stole your shoes [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=226.16s)]
*  in the middle of Fifth Avenue? Really? The podcast hosts actually say they later asked [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=232.56s)]
*  George Santos for the police report for his mugging on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=239.28s)]
*  Street at 3 p.m. in the middle of the day when they took, among other things, his shoes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=244.88s)]
*  But they say they never heard back from him when they asked for the police report. We have also [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  asked Congressman Santos' office for that police report. We will let you know if we hear anything. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=254.88s)]
*  We've also put in a records request with the NYPD for any police report that matches what Mr. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=261.36s)]
*  Santos described. We live in hope. But perhaps the most magnificent moment of this interview [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  comes when Congressman Santos tries to explain to these podcast hosts why it is that he personally [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=274.8s)]
*  takes such a hard line toward undocumented immigrants when he himself comes from a family [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=281.76s)]
*  of immigrants. Watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=287.36s)]
*  I'm [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=304.8s)]
*  assiduously critical of people who want to start their American dream the wrong way. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=331.52s)]
*  Imagine starting a relationship with a lie. Imagine starting a relationship with a lie. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=337.44s)]
*  Imagine how awful that would be. Because, of course, he would never lie. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=344.88s)]
*  You're Republican congress at work. Republican Congressman George Santos. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V43vAK0TNE&t=349.84s)]
