# 'Back off!': Maddow shames Republicans attacking justice system to protect Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY)
*  The Stormy Daniels pay to cover up the affair hush money case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the only one that's going to go to trial before the election. Really? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Wasn't supposed to be the first one. Remember what was going to be the first one? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=9.6s)]
*  What was going to be the first one was a trial of Donald Trump for the big issue, right? For him [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=14.16s)]
*  trying to throw out the results of the 2020 election so he could stay in power even though he lost. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=20.72s)]
*  Prosecutors asked the judge to start this trial two months ago. The first trial date they asked for [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=26.16s)]
*  was in early March 2024. That was going to be first. What happened to that? Well, when it emerged [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=31.28s)]
*  January 2021 that there was a recording of Trump live on the phone demanding that Georgia officials [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=39.68s)]
*  falsify the election results and declare him the winner. When everybody heard that tape, everybody [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=45.92s)]
*  over the age of zero in this country knew that they were going to be the first one to be in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  the country. They knew that there would have to be a criminal investigation of that. I mean, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=54.08s)]
*  that very much sounded like the commission of a very obvious crime on tape. The district attorney [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=58.4s)]
*  in the county where the phone call took place then opened that criminal investigation. Of course, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=64.24s)]
*  she did. How could she not have? But then what happened, right? They opened the floodgates on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  her in a way that is underappreciated in this country. First thing they did, Republicans in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=76.4s)]
*  the state legislature decided that for the first time in the history of that state, they needed to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=84.0s)]
*  give themselves a new power. They needed to give themselves the power to remove prosecutors from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=88.16s)]
*  their jobs, even in the middle of a case. Now, Republicans in the Georgia state legislature never [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=94.24s)]
*  wanted that power before now in the whole history of the state. But now that Trump's under [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=100.08s)]
*  investigation for a crime, now they want that new power. This new law giving themselves that power, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=104.88s)]
*  they passed it in such a rush. It suffered from what you might charitably call constitutional [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=109.68s)]
*  infirmities. They then had to pass it again. So they did. And in so doing, they created a board [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  with all Republican appointees. It has a brand new power under the laws of the state of Georgia [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=120.48s)]
*  to discipline and remove prosecutors in the middle of their cases, a power they never had before, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=125.84s)]
*  never wanted before, not before Fannie Willis brought a case against Donald Trump. But that was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  only the start. Led by one of the Republicans who served as a fake elector in Georgia, Republicans [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=136.64s)]
*  in that state then formed a Georgia Senate Special Committee on Investigations. Oh, what investigations [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=144.0s)]
*  are they wanting to do? They are specifically investigating Fannie Willis. They formed a new [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=151.2s)]
*  committee just for that purpose. The head of that new committee to investigate Fannie Willis went to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  the Georgia State Republican Convention this weekend to brag about how he's about to subpoena [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  her to testify under oath and force her to hand over evidence to the Republicans in the Georgia [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=165.44s)]
*  State Senate. They're characterizing it as a financial concern, but he's been very explicit [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=171.04s)]
*  that the financial concern he has is that she's expending financial resources on the Trump prosecution. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=177.04s)]
*  Republicans at the county level in Georgia are now saying they want to put her office [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=186.48s)]
*  through an audit. A Republican member of Congress from Georgia has filed an ethics [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=190.8s)]
*  complaint against her. The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, has opened an investigation of her in Washington as well and has [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  subpoenaed her and is now threatening to hold her in contempt of Congress, threatening to put her [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=207.28s)]
*  in jail. And now two Republican U.S. senators are jumping in as well. Senators Ron Johnson and Chuck [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Grassley just announcing a few days ago that they too are going to open a new investigation [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=219.04s)]
*  of this Georgia prosecutor, Fannie Willis, this time opening this investigation in the United States [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=224.16s)]
*  Senate. They have created a maelstrom of political harassment and pressure, bringing it down to bear [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=229.28s)]
*  on this one prosecutor like a laser because she brought this case against someone of their party [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  who has political power. This is Republicans using their political power to try to shut off [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=245.12s)]
*  the legal system, to try to shut off the rule of law here so it cannot be used against their guy, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  against Trump. Let's get real about this and take it seriously because what's going on here is they [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=258.24s)]
*  are taking apart the judicial system. They are fundamentally changing the judiciary in the state [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=266.64s)]
*  in the entire state all to protect this one powerful defendant in their own party [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=274.56s)]
*  whom she had the temerity to charge. Fannie Willis is ably defending herself. She is good at this [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=281.2s)]
*  and she knew what she was walking into. But this story for all of us, this is not a profile in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=290.88s)]
*  courage. This is a profile in cowardice. This is a profile in failure and neglect by us, by the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=297.04s)]
*  country because the reason she is out there defending herself so ably is because nobody [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  else is defending her. She's standing alone against all of this. The rule of law depends on [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=312.56s)]
*  the people who enforce it being able to enforce it even when those who are implicated in a legal [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=321.84000000000003s)]
*  proceeding are powerful people. These are human beings. They are not magic. They are not bullet [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=326.32s)]
*  proof. They are not superhuman. And right now they have no one defending them as they are being asked [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=331.68s)]
*  to bear superhuman pressure and threat. And I get it that there is a sort of good faith instinct [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=338.64s)]
*  against defending these folks, right? For Americans who believe in the independence [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=349.76s)]
*  and professionalism of the judiciary, why step up politically and defend a judge or a prosecutor? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=353.84s)]
*  That's supposed to be a non-political part of our system, right? Right, true. But here, in reality, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  in this era of this Republican party, there is a ton of inappropriate political pressure, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=365.28s)]
*  improper craven pretextual dishonest intimidation being brought to bear on prosecutors and on judges [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=372.32s)]
*  from the right, from the allies of the former president. And it is working. And there has been [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=378.96s)]
*  no significant countervailing pressure defending them. If you go after a judge's family, if you [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=385.44s)]
*  demonize a prosecutor and bring bogus allegations and charges against them, it is you who are [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  breaking the American legal system. And you ought to be the one who pays for that. I mean, thus far, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=397.44s)]
*  what's the price been? Other than getting heckled by fed up New Yorkers on the sidewalks sometimes, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=404.08s)]
*  the Republicans who are waging war on the legal system, proclaiming the illegitimacy of the legal [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=410.4s)]
*  system on behalf of Donald Trump, up until now, they are paying no cost for it. The rule of law [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=417.36s)]
*  in this country, in practical terms, is made up of people doing hard jobs who themselves can break [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  when they are attacked. And right now, you and I, all of us, we are making history in this country. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=427.6s)]
*  And the history that we are making is that there is no one defending Fannie Willis but herself. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=435.36s)]
*  And in the noble alternate version of this history that we'd like to imagine we would be part of, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=441.68s)]
*  the whole country would be up in arms about Georgia and about New York and about all of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=448.16s)]
*  these cases, telling these people to back off the judges, back off the witnesses and the jurors, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=452.16s)]
*  back off the prosecutors, back off Fannie Willis, protect these cases, protect the rule of law. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=457.04s)]
*  We imagine that's who we are as a country, but we are not showing it. We are not standing up [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=465.04s)]
*  to defend these people. At least, not yet. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAV2qRnZ8aY&t=487.04s)]
