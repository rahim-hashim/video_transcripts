Video Description: Rachel Maddow reports on the extreme popularity of allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices that helped the Democrats turn the policy into law. Popularity that makes it hard to understand why Republicans are pushing a bill to reverse the law, effectively raising drug prices in an election year.

# Rubio Backs Bill That Would Raise Drug Prices; Odd Move For An Election Year In Florida
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4)
*  I know it feels like there's nothing we can agree on as Americans in these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=0.0s)]
*  polarized times. Maybe puppies? Ice cream? Obviously Dolly Parton? Yes, but [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=4.28s)]
*  politically, is there anything the vast, vast majority of us agree on? There's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  this. By overwhelming margins, Americans support legislation to lower the price [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=16.8s)]
*  of prescription drugs. A huge margin, Americans are in favor of allowing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=21.68s)]
*  Medicare, which is the health insurance program for seniors, allowing Medicare [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=26.2s)]
*  to negotiate with drug companies to make drugs cheaper. Poll after poll. Americans [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=30.72s)]
*  who support that, it's like 70 to 80 plus percent. It is puppies and ice cream [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=35.16s)]
*  level support. Well, lo and behold, representative democracy has broken out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=39.16s)]
*  Democrats included a provision along those lines when they passed the big [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=44.68s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act this past summer. Voters said it was their favorite part [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  of the bill. Democrats kept the provision in there. They passed the bill. They [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=54.04s)]
*  accomplished this goal they'd been pursuing for a generation when President [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=57.2s)]
*  Biden signed it into law in August, something Americans have wanted by huge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=60.12s)]
*  margins for decades. Medicare negotiating for lower drug prices. It [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=64.12s)]
*  becomes the very, very popular law of the land. Congratulations. Plus same [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=69.0s)]
*  bill put a cap on how much seniors have to pay for drugs overall, including [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=75.6s)]
*  insulin, also hugely popular. And the Democrats got it done. They got it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=81.04s)]
*  passed. And that is how things stand right now in the law. Under the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=85.48s)]
*  legislation, President Biden signed America, seniors will be paying less for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  their prescription drugs. No one will ever have to pay more than $2000 a year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=93.92s)]
*  The price of drugs in general will get negotiated down for everyone. It's done. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  It's in the law. And now, one month out from the elections, Republicans have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  unveiled their own new plan, their own new bill on this issue, a bill that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=107.56s)]
*  would do just one thing. It would undo all that stuff on drug prices. No more [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  price caps on prescription drugs, no more negotiating for lower prices. Get [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=118.4s)]
*  rid of all that. It is literally a bill to make prescription drugs more [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=122.28s)]
*  expensive for senior citizens. That's the only thing it will do. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=126.92s)]
*  Perhaps most astoundingly, one of the co sponsors of this new Republican higher [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=132.68s)]
*  drug prices for old people bill is Republican Senator Marco Rubio of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=137.36s)]
*  Florida, who happens to be in the midst of a competitive race against a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=141.52s)]
*  formidable challenger. Democratic Congresswoman, the former Orlando [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  police chief Val Demings is running against him. And did I mention this is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=148.68s)]
*  a Senate race in Florida? You may have heard Florida has a sizable population [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  of the olds who vote. Florida has the second highest number of Medicare [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=157.84s)]
*  recipients of any state in the country. So you're running for Senate in Florida [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=162.32s)]
*  and you're going to sponsor legislation to raise drug prices for all senior [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=168.12s)]
*  citizens right now, a month out from the election. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=172.44s)]
*  That is an amazing closing argument. I mean, between [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Biden pardoning everybody for pot possession, unemployment below 4%, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=181.12s)]
*  Republicans literally pursuing a national abortion ban and a bill designed [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  to raise the cost of prescriptions for old people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=190.52s)]
*  How are we doing this right now? How is this the closing argument? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=194.52s)]
*  But it is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQAIzMH_Rm4&t=199.12s)]
