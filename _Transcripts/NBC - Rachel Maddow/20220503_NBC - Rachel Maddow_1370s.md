# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 2
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io)
*  Our friend Dahlia Lithwick joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=0.0s)]
*  She's a senior editor at Slate Magazine. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=2.02s)]
*  She writes about the courts. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=3.7s)]
*  She's the host of their Amicus podcast. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=4.66s)]
*  Dahlia, I want you to tell me [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  if I have said anything wrong thus far, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=9.72s)]
*  and I want you to tell me what you're thinking. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=11.84s)]
*  No, I think you've said it right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=15.9s)]
*  I think Josh used swing for the fences, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=18.02s)]
*  and this is both a swing for the fences [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=20.96s)]
*  in terms of Justice Alito's rhetoric and language. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=23.06s)]
*  As you noted, this is not a milk toast opinion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=27.18s)]
*  This is just going for broke. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=31.62s)]
*  It's also a swing for the fences [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=34.42s)]
*  in terms of the way this happened. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  We have never, ever, ever seen a 98 page draft opinion [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=39.66s)]
*  or heard about deliberations, who's writing dissents. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=45.36s)]
*  Every piece of this, Rachel, is astonishing, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=49.9s)]
*  and you almost can't let the one astonishing thing, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=53.18s)]
*  which is the substance of this draft opinion, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=56.8s)]
*  overmaster the other astonishing thing, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=60.36s)]
*  which is that I guess all bets are off now at the court, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=63.04s)]
*  and norms and traditions that have stood intact [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=67.16s)]
*  for centuries, if not for decades, are gone, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=70.92s)]
*  and now we just leak opinions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=74.32s)]
*  Well, let me ask you about the substance of that, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=77.52s)]
*  because I think a lot of Americans [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=79.2s)]
*  hearing this news right now, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  maybe even watching this show right now, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=81.6s)]
*  are gobsmacked by the revelation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=83.96s)]
*  that yeah, we might have heard it was coming, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  we might have heard the warnings, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  but this means that the government's going to force women [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  to give birth now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=91.77999999999999s)]
*  This is going to make abortion illegal [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  in most of the country, in much of the country instantly, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=95.24s)]
*  and potentially in all of the country soon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  I think most people are very gobsmacked by that, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=101.1s)]
*  but I think you rightfully point out [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=103.32s)]
*  that this means something important [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=105.35999999999999s)]
*  in terms of the rule of law, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  in terms of our system of government. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  We've got the executive branch, the legislative branch, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=109.6s)]
*  and the judicial branch, and the judicial branch [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=112.16s)]
*  is headed by the Supreme Court, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=114.8s)]
*  which is a self-governing institution [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=117.0s)]
*  which does not have external ethics rules, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  for example, that apply to them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=120.84s)]
*  This justices police themselves, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=122.02s)]
*  they set their own mores and traditions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  It's a somewhat secretive body, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  it's certainly a very small one, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=128.0s)]
*  it's the smallest of all branches. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=129.56s)]
*  If, like you say, all bets are off [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=132.34s)]
*  and draft opinions get leaked now, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=134.84s)]
*  and the procedural shock that we've got tonight [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=137.44s)]
*  also takes hold, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=141.88s)]
*  what's consequential about that to us as Americans? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=143.64s)]
*  I mean, I just think this is a last bastion [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  of how the court, as you said, polices itself. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=152.28s)]
*  I mean, we did not see leaked drafts in Bush v. Gore, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=156.56s)]
*  we did not see leaked drafts in the first Obamacare, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=160.04s)]
*  I mean, not in Heller, it's just not done. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=164.6s)]
*  We certainly heard whispers occasionally, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=168.32s)]
*  but even that, I think, was never reliable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=170.84s)]
*  And so when you're getting, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=174.08s)]
*  I think it's important to say this is a first draft, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=176.88s)]
*  and it's important to think of that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=179.52s)]
*  as sort of a first bid, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=180.68s)]
*  This is presumably gonna get honed and refined, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=182.8s)]
*  people may be put off by some of the sharp language in here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=186.88s)]
*  This is clearly Justice Alito [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  giving a little something to Justice Barrett, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=194.44s)]
*  giving her the sort of safe haven concerns she had [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=197.52s)]
*  about dropping babies off at fire stations, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=201.6s)]
*  the eugenics claims that those are very near and dear [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=203.28s)]
*  to Justice Thomas's heart. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=206.92s)]
*  So he's dumped it all in here, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=208.64s)]
*  and presumably not all of the justices, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=210.48s)]
*  we again don't know what Chief Justice Roberts is thinking, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=214.32s)]
*  there's a huge John Roberts shaped hole [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=217.72s)]
*  in this draft opinion, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=220.64s)]
*  but I think this presumably gets buffed down somewhat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=222.12s)]
*  But I think that if it is in fact the case [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=226.68s)]
*  that the long standing norm governing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=229.52s)]
*  how clerks conduct themselves and justices conduct themselves, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=233.72s)]
*  which is that we don't have leaks at the US Supreme Court, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=237.0s)]
*  if that's gone, then it's really, really very hard to see [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=240.4s)]
*  what other rules they will be using to conduct themselves, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=245.08s)]
*  because this is just, as you said, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=250.52s)]
*  a gobsmacking, gobsmacking turn of events. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  And it's very, very clear to me [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=256.88s)]
*  that it's not just the leak that people are talking, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=260.48s)]
*  and that this is clearly being done, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=263.20000000000005s)]
*  we don't know by who, to either soften the blow [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=265.68s)]
*  or kind of inflate the blow of what's coming in June, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  and so it's, I think, being done for purely political reasons, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=273.76s)]
*  which also goes to your question about rule of law, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=277.44s)]
*  a court that cares about its appearance [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  as a institution that is above politics, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  just threw caution to the wind and made a determination [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=287.8s)]
*  to do the most brazen political act that I've ever seen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=292.12s)]
*  I keep thinking about a recent article [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=298.44s)]
*  that was published about the kind of new, new right [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=302.56s)]
*  and what's happening in terms of like, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  eccentric right-wing sort of fascist-friendly billionaire, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=307.24s)]
*  Peter Thiel funding new kinds of Republican candidates. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=311.48s)]
*  So thinking about that article recently [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=315.44s)]
*  in The Atlantic and the moment where J.D. Vance, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  whose Ohio Senate primary is tomorrow, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  is speaking on a podcast, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=325.8s)]
*  talking about what kind of politician he wants to be, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=327.64s)]
*  why he wants to join the Senate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  And he says, at one point, he says that part of the reason [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  he wants Trump to win, run again and win again in 2024 [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  is that he thinks that if Trump gets in there, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=337.36s)]
*  he should fire every single federal government employee [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  in the entire country and just fire them all at once. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  And he acknowledges that there are legal protections [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=345.32s)]
*  for a lot of people in those jobs. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=348.84s)]
*  And so that sort of a mass firing, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=350.44s)]
*  which has been a right-wing fantasy for a long time, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  that would be illegal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=356.11999999999995s)]
*  And J.D. Vance sort of speculates that, you know, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=357.32s)]
*  and of course that would go to the courts [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=359.64s)]
*  and it would get to the Supreme Court [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=361.11999999999995s)]
*  and they'd rule against him, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=362.28s)]
*  but then he should pull on Andrew Jackson and just say, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=363.44s)]
*  well, the chief justice has made his ruling, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=365.52s)]
*  now let him enforce it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=368.52s)]
*  And that is again, like sort of a right-wing, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  you know, man on a white horse fantasy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=374.64s)]
*  about the kind of government [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=376.44s)]
*  and the kind of governing that they want. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=378.32s)]
*  But it also shows that the court isn't in a safe position [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  from the right right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=384.32s)]
*  And it's, I think, come under really serious scrutiny [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=386.52s)]
*  from the left in terms of the ethics issues [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=389.88s)]
*  surrounding particular Clarence Thomas, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=391.96s)]
*  Justice Thomas and his wife and her involvement [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=393.84s)]
*  in political issues related to cases before Trump. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=396.24s)]
*  And I think that that's a very, very important point [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  that the court has to make [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=403.0s)]
*  to make sure that the justice system [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=404.44s)]
*  is within the limits of her husband and the court. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=406.4s)]
*  The legitimacy of the court is just an academic thing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a question as to whether or not [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=413.52s)]
*  their rulings are followed, and if they're not, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=414.96s)]
*  they don't have an army, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=417.0s)]
*  they don't have a police force to implement these things. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=418.0s)]
*  It does feel like this gets us closer to that edge, too. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=422.08s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=427.08s)]
*  I think that the court has been in a very difficult [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  and very difficult position [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=431.04s)]
*  in terms of the political ratings [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=432.92s)]
*  since Gallup has been polling, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=435.24s)]
*  So depending on the poll, it was the high 30s, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=437.88s)]
*  the low 40s. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=440.32s)]
*  I know that seems astronomically high [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  compared to other branches of government, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  but it's catastrophically low for the court, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  and it's dropped substantially [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  in a really compressed amount of time. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think the thing we have to think about [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=452.68s)]
*  is that when Justice Alito or Justice Vorsach [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=454.72s)]
*  and when you hear the court say, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=458.76s)]
*  don't impose ethics rules and standards on us, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  don't force us to have meaningful recusal rules, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=462.2s)]
*  what they're saying is don't criticize the court [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  because you're undermining the court. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=468.64s)]
*  And I think your point here is so important, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=470.56s)]
*  which is that the court is undermining the court, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=473.0s)]
*  whether it's the shadow docket, as you said, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=475.67999999999995s)]
*  the ethics violations, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=477.64s)]
*  whether it's reaching out to take cases [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  that are not before it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=481.4s)]
*  There's a whole litany of things that the court has done [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=482.67999999999995s)]
*  in a really short amount of time [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  that is horrifying objectively [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=488.04s)]
*  to anybody who cares about the court. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=489.64s)]
*  And maybe I would just end with this [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=492.52s)]
*  because I think it's really important. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=493.92s)]
*  There is a non-trivial chance [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=495.76s)]
*  that the 2024 election goes to the court. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=497.6s)]
*  And the idea that progressives and Democrats [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=501.08s)]
*  want to undermine the court [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=504.28s)]
*  because they want the court to come down [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=505.84s)]
*  with a decision we can all ignore is chilling. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=508.08s)]
*  Because as I've said many times, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=511.48s)]
*  there's no plan B if we ignore the court. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=513.72s)]
*  Plan B is the army, it's not good. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=516.28s)]
*  And so we want to have a court [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=518.72s)]
*  that has neither the purse nor the sword, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=520.64s)]
*  That's the Federalist Papers, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=523.08s)]
*  but that has public respect in regard. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=524.44s)]
*  And when the court itself is really working [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=527.2s)]
*  very, very hard to undermine that, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=530.84s)]
*  it's awfully hard to say that this is anything [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=533.32s)]
*  other than A, a self-inflicted wound, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=535.8s)]
*  and B, a self-inflicted wound [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=538.6s)]
*  that is going to redound to the benefit of absolutely nobody [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=540.36s)]
*  when the rubber hits the road [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=544.44s)]
*  and we need a legitimate court. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=547.0s)]
*  Dahlia Lithwick, Senior Editor at Slate Magazine. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=549.48s)]
*  Thank you for your time tonight, Dahlia, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=551.6s)]
*  as we continue to respond to this breaking news. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=552.92s)]
*  I know it's hard to talk about something [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=554.64s)]
*  while we are still absorbing it, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=556.68s)]
*  and none of us had time to read 98 pages of this opinion, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=557.92s)]
*  let alone the 30-something page appendix [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=560.28s)]
*  before getting on the air. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=562.0s)]
*  Thank you for helping us as we're learning it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=563.36s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=566.36s)]
*  I want to bring into the conversation now [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=568.64s)]
*  one of the members of Congress [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=570.92s)]
*  who is most qualified to talk about this matter, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=572.52s)]
*  specifically because he is an esteemed [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=575.52s)]
*  constitutional scholar. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=577.64s)]
*  Maryland Congressman, member of the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=579.44s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, was booked to be here tonight [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  to talk about the January 6th investigation [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  and other matters before Congress. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=586.32s)]
*  But, Congressman, I have to start tonight, at least, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=588.52s)]
*  by talking to you about this breaking news. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=591.04s)]
*  Thanks very much for joining us. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=592.84s)]
*  Sure, I'm delighted to be with you, Rachel. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=594.36s)]
*  Have you had a chance to look at Mr. Gerstein's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  reporting at Politico or at all at the ruling [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=598.72s)]
*  that has been published tonight from the court? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=601.64s)]
*  Yes, I just sped-read the decision. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=603.48s)]
*  I found it astonishing and appalling. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=606.6400000000001s)]
*  The basic legal claim here is that the word abortion [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=610.84s)]
*  doesn't appear in the Constitution, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=615.5200000000001s)]
*  and of course it doesn't appear in the Constitution, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=617.5600000000001s)]
*  but the Supreme Court in 1973 in Roe v. Wade [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=620.24s)]
*  hinged its reasoning on Griswold v. Connecticut, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=624.2s)]
*  which was a 1965 decision by the Supreme Court [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=628.08s)]
*  striking down a law banning birth control, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=633.6400000000001s)]
*  even for married couples in Connecticut, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=636.5200000000001s)]
*  and the Supreme Court said that the due process [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=638.6s)]
*  liberty clause includes a right to privacy [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=641.6s)]
*  over intimate decision-making. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=645.24s)]
*  So the point is that Justice Alito's decision [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=647.6400000000001s)]
*  would apply also, presumably, to the right to privacy [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=651.96s)]
*  in contraception, and we know, of course, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  there is a right-wing war on contraception now, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  but if Casey is to fall, if Roe v. Wade is to fall, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=661.08s)]
*  then Griswold v. Connecticut, presumably, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=665.08s)]
*  is to fall as well because the word contraception [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=667.76s)]
*  or birth control doesn't appear in the Constitution. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=670.44s)]
*  Indeed, the phrase right to privacy [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=673.48s)]
*  doesn't appear in the Constitution, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=676.1600000000001s)]
*  so this would appear to be an invitation [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=678.88s)]
*  to have a handmaid's-tail type anti-feminist regulation [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=681.0s)]
*  and legislation all over the country [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=688.24s)]
*  and all of that is perfectly in keeping [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=690.76s)]
*  with Justice Alito's opinion, which admittedly, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  I just read in like the last 20 minutes, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=695.52s)]
*  but to my mind, it situates the trajectory [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=697.8000000000001s)]
*  of the American right in where Fox News [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=703.6s)]
*  and Tucker Carlson wanna go, which is to make us [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=708.36s)]
*  in the image of Hungarian illiberal democracy now [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=711.4s)]
*  to keep elections going where people can be whipped up [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=716.9200000000001s)]
*  about various scapegoats, but to carve out [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=720.7199999999999s)]
*  and destroy the freedoms and the rights of the people [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=723.68s)]
*  and that's where the right-wing seems to be going [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=726.92s)]
*  with this decision and the Supreme Court [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=729.68s)]
*  if it actually goes through with this majority draft opinion [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=732.68s)]
*  which somehow is leaked out and which does look, to me, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=736.8s)]
*  completely real or at least an extraordinary forgery [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  of what a Supreme Court decision by Justice Alito [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=744.0s)]
*  looks like and sounds like, but if it does go forward [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=746.3599999999999s)]
*  with it, I believe that the court will have returned [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=748.68s)]
*  to its historic baseline of being a reactionary [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=753.2399999999999s)]
*  conservative institution to the far right of everything else [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=758.56s)]
*  at the federal level in the government [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=762.88s)]
*  and it's still got this lingering faint halo around it [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=765.64s)]
*  from the Warren Court period with Brown versus Board [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=769.56s)]
*  and Roe versus Wade, Griswold versus Connecticut, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=772.4399999999999s)]
*  Miranda versus Arizona, but for most of our history, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=775.44s)]
*  take all the way up to the Civil War, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=779.48s)]
*  the Supreme Court, for example, never did anything [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=781.1400000000001s)]
*  for enslaved Americans other than to cement [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=783.7600000000001s)]
*  and constitutionalize the system of slavery [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  in the Dred Scott decision and to declare [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=789.6800000000001s)]
*  that African Americans have no rights [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=792.0400000000001s)]
*  that the white man is bound to respect [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  and to declare that the Constitution [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=796.2s)]
*  is indeed a white man's compact [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=798.0400000000001s)]
*  and then even after the Civil War [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=799.8800000000001s)]
*  and the Reconstruction Amendments, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  the court articulated American apartheid [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=803.12s)]
*  in Plessy versus Ferguson approving Jim Crow arrangements [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=806.0s)]
*  throughout most of the country. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=811.92s)]
*  So there was that brief few decade period [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=813.16s)]
*  with the Warren Court, but then with the Burger Court, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=815.84s)]
*  the Rehnquist Court and now the Roberts Court, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=818.32s)]
*  the Supreme Court has returned to that traditional baseline [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=820.2s)]
*  and all it means to me, at least in my mind, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=824.04s)]
*  and admittedly I was speaking as a person in politics, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=827.36s)]
*  but we need to turn out the vote [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=830.86s)]
*  like we've never turned out the vote before. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=833.74s)]
*  The people need to stand up and defend [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=835.02s)]
*  democratic institutions and the rights of the people [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=837.78s)]
*  because the Supreme Court [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=840.54s)]
*  is certainly not doing anything for us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=841.9s)]
*  Congressman Raskin, let me ask you a question [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=845.12s)]
*  that I posed to Josh Gerstein, the reporter [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=846.64s)]
*  who broke this story at the top of the hour. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=849.04s)]
*  From the ruling, the way that it is written, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=851.5799999999999s)]
*  and again, with the caveat that this is a, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=854.36s)]
*  what appears to be a first draft opinion [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=857.22s)]
*  and it will likely go through many other iterations [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=860.3s)]
*  and lots of changes before we ultimately get the ruling, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=862.9399999999999s)]
*  but based on what we've got, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=865.42s)]
*  this remarkable leak of a first draft [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  and the way that Justice Alito [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=869.9s)]
*  has constructed this argument, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=872.0s)]
*  if this survives in, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=873.66s)]
*  if this mostly survives intact, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=877.3399999999999s)]
*  is there anything here that would prevent [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=880.38s)]
*  Republican controlled states [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=884.5s)]
*  or indeed a Republican controlled Congress [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=886.04s)]
*  and a Republican president [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=888.18s)]
*  from outlawing abortion full stop in every instance, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=890.56s)]
*  making it a crime that put doctors in prison, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=894.0s)]
*  potentially put women in prison, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=897.1999999999999s)]
*  is there any new restriction [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=899.36s)]
*  on the ability of the government [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=901.9599999999999s)]
*  to force women to give birth that is recognized here [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=904.0799999999999s)]
*  or is it an elimination entirely of that restriction? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=908.04s)]
*  It is an elimination entirely as I read it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=912.28s)]
*  I mean, the good thing about Roe versus Wade [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  or Planned Parenthood versus Casey, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=918.32s)]
*  which was that it established a balance [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=920.08s)]
*  between the liberty of the woman [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=922.0600000000001s)]
*  to seek reproductive healthcare [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  in consultation with her physician and her family. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=926.6600000000001s)]
*  It was a private choice. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=929.34s)]
*  It was not up to state legislators [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  and to members of Congress, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=932.6600000000001s)]
*  but there was a balancing test [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  against the developing fetus [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=936.8000000000001s)]
*  and so that at a certain point under Roe versus Wade, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=940.2s)]
*  for example, in the third trimester, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=942.96s)]
*  it could be banned entirely [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=944.96s)]
*  and the decision could be regulated [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=946.92s)]
*  in the interest of maternal and fetal health [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=950.4399999999999s)]
*  in the second trimester, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=953.56s)]
*  but this abolishes the balancing test entirely [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=955.0s)]
*  and says because abortion's not mentioned [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=958.26s)]
*  in the constitution and presumably, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=960.64s)]
*  there is no right to privacy, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=962.84s)]
*  according to Justice Alito, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=964.76s)]
*  the legislatures can do whatever they want. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=966.04s)]
*  So look, I serve on the Judiciary Committee [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=968.6s)]
*  and the Oversight Committee. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=972.52s)]
*  We've had lots of hearings about this. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=973.4s)]
*  The same right-wing lawyers who filed all these cases [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=975.48s)]
*  and are always filing the amicus briefs, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=979.08s)]
*  they don't take the position [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=981.04s)]
*  that there's any kind of balancing. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=982.9200000000001s)]
*  They say it's perfectly fine for the legislatures [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=985.04s)]
*  to prohibit the procedure entirely, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=987.82s)]
*  including in cases of rape of the woman, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=990.24s)]
*  including in cases of problematic medical issues [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=994.04s)]
*  that might come up. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1000.64s)]
*  They say that that's just up to the state legislature. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1001.52s)]
*  So if there's a move on right now [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1003.58s)]
*  to pass a federal law that would categorically [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1006.4200000000001s)]
*  prohibit abortion, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1009.5400000000001s)]
*  the only thing stopping them from doing that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1010.82s)]
*  will be the votes in the House and the votes in the Senate [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1013.64s)]
*  and the potential veto of the President of the United States [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1016.9000000000001s)]
*  because they don't see any jurisprudential, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1020.14s)]
*  any constitutional impediment to doing that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1023.3000000000001s)]
*  Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1028.5s)]
*  member of the Judiciary Committee, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1030.58s)]

*  Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1053.6s)]
*  Let me just get your reaction to this news again. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1056.24s)]
*  The headline tonight in Politico, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1059.04s)]
*  Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1060.16s)]
*  Draft opinion shows. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  Now, everyone's given you the disclaimers, Rachel, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1066.18s)]
*  and we don't know what the final opinion will be, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1069.3400000000001s)]
*  but I will say that I have predicted this for a long time [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1072.94s)]
*  based on the court arguments [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1076.88s)]
*  and based on the hearings for these justices. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  I asked Amy Coney Barrett [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1081.02s)]
*  if she thought Roe v. Wade was super precedent. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1083.22s)]
*  She did not think that it was. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1085.8200000000002s)]
*  And yet, I believe the American people are with us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1088.1000000000001s)]
*  I'd like to focus a bit here on what's gonna happen [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1093.8200000000002s)]
*  if they do issue this opinion [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1096.8200000000002s)]
*  when all signs point to that they will, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1098.46s)]
*  not just this leak, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  but they have said in the past. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1105.5800000000002s)]
*  If this is issued, over 20 states, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1107.8200000000002s)]
*  there's a trigger where abortion will automatically be banned. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1110.26s)]
*  So it's no longer gonna be a decision [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1114.66s)]
*  between a woman and her doctor. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1116.74s)]
*  Basically, I guess Ted Cruz [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1118.38s)]
*  has made this decision for people. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1120.2s)]
*  The second thing that we're gonna see happen [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1123.58s)]
*  is that you're going to have individual states [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1125.98s)]
*  considering laws, banning it, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1128.66s)]
*  and meanwhile, in Washington, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1130.5s)]
*  it's on us now to try to codify Roe v. Wade into law. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1133.34s)]
*  And as you know, we have two Republican senators [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1137.4s)]
*  who are with us when it comes to choice, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1142.5s)]
*  but the question is, with the filibuster in place, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1145.3s)]
*  which I firmly believe we should reverse, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1148.06s)]
*  could we ever get to 60? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1151.26s)]
*  So this is what we're dealing with right now. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1153.1s)]
*  And I cannot overemphasize what a change this is, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1156.18s)]
*  what a disregard to precedent. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1161.82s)]
*  If this is true, yes, we can be outraged, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1163.62s)]
*  but we also have to plan. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1166.58s)]
*  We are going into election year. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1167.94s)]
*  We are going into the fall [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1169.98s)]
*  where women's rights are going to be on the ballot. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1172.94s)]
*  And so if nothing can get done in Washington [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1176.78s)]
*  because of Republican obstructionism, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1179.74s)]
*  then the American people and women are gonna have to vote [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1182.7s)]
*  and people who believe in choice are gonna have to vote [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1185.98s)]
*  like they never voted before [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1188.5s)]
*  because that's the only way we can change this up [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1190.18s)]
*  or we're gonna have a patchwork of laws across the country. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1192.46s)]
*  Senator, as you know, one of the things [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1197.1200000000001s)]
*  that is most determinative of a woman's economic freedom [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1200.26s)]
*  and self-determination is her ability [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1203.7s)]
*  to make her own decisions about when [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1206.7s)]
*  if she has kids, if that becomes the government's decision, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1209.1399999999999s)]
*  if that is no longer a decision [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1213.3799999999999s)]
*  that women are allowed to make for themselves. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1214.86s)]
*  That fundamentally changes the economic and life [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1217.98s)]
*  and cultural prospects for every woman in the country. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1221.02s)]
*  I wonder if that stark truth about what this does [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1224.8999999999999s)]
*  to the future of American womanhood [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1230.52s)]
*  and the future of the American family, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1232.3799999999999s)]
*  the future of who we are as a culture [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1233.58s)]
*  might be enough to scare Republicans in Washington [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1236.2600000000002s)]
*  off an effort to do a nationwide ban. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1238.98s)]
*  I mean, as you say, those trigger laws [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1241.46s)]
*  don't require any action. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1243.22s)]
*  They'll just go into effect in more than 20 states. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1244.5800000000002s)]
*  But we have reporting on the Washington Post today [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1246.98s)]
*  that they want a nationwide six-week flat ban. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1248.7s)]
*  Do you think that they might be the dog [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1252.5400000000002s)]
*  that catches the car in that case? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1253.98s)]
*  They may be too scared to actually do something that radical [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1255.38s)]
*  or do you think they'd just go for it? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1257.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, obviously they are not gonna be able [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1260.18s)]
*  to pass something like this in the Senate right now [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1262.82s)]
*  because Democrats have the slim 50-50, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1266.1s)]
*  but we have the majority. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1269.34s)]
*  But I think what you're going to see [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1270.86s)]
*  is a discussion of this in real terms [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1273.22s)]
*  like we've never seen before. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1275.76s)]
*  Back alley abortions, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1277.9399999999998s)]
*  people having to take buses to other states, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1279.3799999999999s)]
*  people not being able, as you said, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1282.58s)]
*  to make their own economic decisions [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1284.1s)]
*  right as they're coming out of this pandemic [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1285.9399999999998s)]
*  where there is so much uncertainty right now [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1288.7s)]
*  and people are just trying to get their grounding. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1291.3799999999999s)]
*  And then we're literally stripping the women [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1293.6599999999999s)]
*  of this country of their rights. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1296.3s)]
*  If that happens, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1297.98s)]
*  I think you're gonna see repercussions like never before. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1299.22s)]
*  They have basically stacked the court [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1303.02s)]
*  with these judges through various procedural games [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1306.18s)]
*  that they played in the Senate. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
*  And now is the moment. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1311.02s)]
*  And the only way this gets decided, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1312.62s)]
*  if this opinion gets issued as is, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1314.82s)]
*  it's gonna be state by state fights about this [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1318.3s)]
*  with the automatic triggers going in place in many, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1320.78s)]
*  and then is going to be a decision for Congress. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1323.78s)]
*  And it makes the election for the House and the Senate [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1326.96s)]
*  more important than any we've seen in our lifetime [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1330.5s)]
*  when it comes to the protection of women's rights. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1334.26s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar, member of the Judiciary Committee [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1339.18s)]
*  representing the great state of Minnesota. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXjJC_O89Io&t=1341.82s)]
