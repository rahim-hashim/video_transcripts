# War plans group chat scandal fits pattern of Trump's embarrassing weakness on information security
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE)
*  As all these things come to fruition and each new day comes to pass in this administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=0.0s)]
*  what they are doing with our data, data security, their handling of sensitive information, has [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=6.92s)]
*  turned into the big populist issue of this administration, and it's turned into just [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  a scandal-generating machine that we are seeing the fruits of every single day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=18.12s)]
*  I mean, we probably should have seen it coming, with Trump in his first term taking all the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=23.44s)]
*  classified documents from his first term and stashing them in his bathroom at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=28.58s)]
*  right, including classified documents concerning nuclear weapons. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=33.22s)]
*  That was probably a hint that this was not going to go well in any second term. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=36.739999999999995s)]
*  We should have seen it coming, probably, at the very beginning of his first term, when [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=40.3s)]
*  he invited Russian government officials and a Russian media outlet into the Oval Office, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=43.86s)]
*  and then he, surprise, gave them code word-level classified information on ongoing covert operations [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=48.46s)]
*  by Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=54.14s)]
*  Yeah, we should have seen that this was going to be one of the problems that we are going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=56.54s)]
*  to be dealing with on a daily basis, but now we've got—it's every day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=59.58s)]
*  We've got him very thoroughly doxing hundreds of people, including his own lawyer, by inexplicably [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=62.82s)]
*  personally insisting that those people's full unredacted Social Security numbers, birth [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=68.3s)]
*  dates and birthplaces should be included, unredacted, in his release of otherwise basically [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=73.9s)]
*  worthless John F. Kennedy assassination files. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=79.3s)]
*  Why did he insist on that? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  We still don't know, but he did it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=83.66s)]
*  And now they're apparently getting new Social Security numbers? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=85.14s)]
*  Good luck on the 1-800 number, waiting to get through to take care of that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=89.14s)]
*  We've had random kids who work for Elon Musk rifling through personnel files in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=93.66s)]
*  U.S. government and individual Americans' tax records and health information and hospitalization [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=98.38s)]
*  records and credit card and banking information. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=103.58s)]
*  It's been a real treat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=105.58s)]
*  The American people really like this idea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=108.06s)]
*  Go steal data from Mars, why don't you? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=111.34s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=114.54s)]
*  NPR reports today that last week, all Defense Department personnel received an advisory [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=118.54s)]
*  warning them that they should not use the app Signal even for unclassified information, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  not because of the security of Signal as an app per se, but because, quote, Russian professional [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=129.18s)]
*  hacking groups were targeting Signal users with phishing attacks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=134.74s)]
*  That was last week. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=140.3s)]
*  The app followed a Defense Department instruction from two years ago in 2023 that reminded Defense [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=141.34s)]
*  Department personnel that Signal should not be used. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=145.78s)]
*  It could not be used for any nonpublic Defense Department information. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  Nevertheless, Signal, of course, is the app on which Donald Trump's hand-picked defense [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=154.58s)]
*  secretary led a robust and detailed group chat about forthcoming military strikes in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=158.94s)]
*  Yemen. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  Recall for a moment that in his infinite wisdom, Donald Trump chose for defense secretary [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  a Fox News weekend host who faced allegations of philandering and serious alcohol abuse, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  including many, many alleged instances of drinking on the job. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Pete Hexeth, of course, denied those allegations. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=184.26s)]
*  And, oh, he looked so good doing it with his American flag handkerchief stuffed into his [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  pocket in case he needed to wipe his nose. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  And so Donald Trump stood by him and his chiseled jaw for the job, and so he got the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=195.3s)]
*  job. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  And now here he is, Pete Hexeth, confidently typing out with his thumbs that we are, quote, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  currently clean on OPSEC. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=206.9s)]
*  While he was texting on Signal reportedly about specific U.S. weapons systems, named [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  human targets and the sequencing and exact timing of the battle plan for forthcoming [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=214.82000000000002s)]
*  U.S. airstrikes abroad, with a group of people that included the vice president, the CIA [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=219.5s)]
*  director, the director of national intelligence, the White House chief of staff, the Treasury [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=224.54s)]
*  secretary for some reason, the secretary of state and also a random journalist who they [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  appear to have added to the chat by mistake. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=232.66s)]
*  But nobody noticed he was there because apparently nobody looked because we're clean on OPSEC. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=235.42s)]
*  Today at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, CIA Director John Ratcliffe told one senator, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  Democrat John Ossoff of Georgia, that this was not a mistake. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=247.94s)]
*  Was this a mistake, sir? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=254.3s)]
*  No. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=255.3s)]
*  I guess this was all on purpose. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=256.3s)]
*  We will speak with Senator John Ossoff about that in just a moment. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=259.62s)]
*  But I mean, here we are, less than a week away from the news. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=264.38s)]
*  This is less than a week after the news that Pete Hexeth apparently had planned a briefing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=267.7s)]
*  in the most secure briefing room in the Pentagon, a briefing on the nation's most classified [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=273.3s)]
*  operational war plans for a war against China. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  He had planned a highest level, highest security Pentagon briefing on those super secret plans [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  for a pro-China U.S. businessman with billions of dollars in debt to China and huge business [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=293.06s)]
*  interest in that country, who also happens to be the top campaign donor to the president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=298.38s)]
*  That plan was apparently only busted up at the last moment when the New York Times reported [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  on it, which I guess embarrassed them too much to go forward with it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=309.86s)]
*  But Pete Hexeth had been planning on doing it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=313.3s)]
*  That was Friday. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=316.34s)]
*  This signal group chat revelation was Monday. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=317.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=320.58s)]
*  I mean, things are rapidly disintegrating here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=321.58s)]
*  Also, I mean, what do we do with the fact that mishandling classified information in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=325.86s)]
*  this way is very clearly a crime? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=332.86s)]
*  I mean, do we expect the FBI will be all over that? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=336.42s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is criminal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=339.42s)]
*  It's not keeping nuclear secrets in the Mar-a-Lago bathroom level of crime, but it's a crime. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=341.18s)]
*  I mean, Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who was apparently accidentally included on this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=346.22s)]
*  signal chain, this group text, says that among the things, CIA Director John Ratcliffe personally [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=350.54s)]
*  volunteered to this signal group chat. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  He put in writing to this group chat on this commercial app. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=359.7s)]
*  Among the things he posted there was the name of an undercover serving CIA officer, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=364.3s)]
*  an active intelligence officer who Goldberg says was serving undercover. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=370.3s)]
*  Chris Coons, Democratic Senator from Delaware, responded to these revelations by saying, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=376.22s)]
*  quote, Every single one of the government officials on this text chain have now committed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=380.14s)]
*  a crime, even if accidentally, that would normally involve a jail sentence. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=384.3s)]
*  It would appear that one of them physically was in Moscow. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=390.58s)]
*  It looks like he was maybe even inside the Kremlin. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=394.85999999999996s)]
*  While he was on this text group chat with these geniuses, among other things, reportedly [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=399.85999999999996s)]
*  naming an undercover CIA officer and debating very specific information about forthcoming [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=405.82s)]
*  military strikes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=411.06s)]
*  Quote, During the group discussion on signal, Goldberg reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=412.46s)]
*  named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5 24 p.m. Eastern Time. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=417.41999999999996s)]
*  That was just after midnight in Russia. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=422.82s)]
*  Trump diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  time. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=431.06s)]
*  A former Putin advisor who was still close to Putin said in a telegram post that, in [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=432.06s)]
*  fact, Witkoff and Putin were meeting at the Kremlin until 1 30 a.m. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=436.7s)]
*  Steve? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=444.05999999999995s)]
*  Did you keep your phone with you while you were in Russia? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=446.3s)]
*  Did you keep your phone with you while you were in the Kremlin? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=449.86s)]
*  Was your phone turned on? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=453.26s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  We're supposed to not worry, though, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=461.18s)]
*  Because these guys are so savvy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  They are. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  They are so tough. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=465.5s)]
*  They are New York real estate tough. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=466.5s)]
*  This was the same trip to Moscow in which Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's real estate [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=470.1s)]
*  friend, came back to the United States and told a heartwarming tale of how Vladimir Putin [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=474.42s)]
*  had given him a painting, a painting of Donald Trump, which Putin had had made for Trump [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=480.42s)]
*  personally. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=487.22s)]
*  And Steve Witkoff hand carried that painting from Russia back to the United States and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=488.42s)]
*  brought it to the White House and gave it to Donald Trump. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=493.1s)]
*  Did anybody check that painting? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=497.70000000000005s)]
*  Anybody like give it a close going over? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=501.42s)]
*  Steve Witkoff did an interview with the pro-Russia ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, in which [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=506.42s)]
*  he gushed about how much he, quote, likes Putin. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=511.38s)]
*  He said, quote, I thought he was straight up with me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=514.46s)]
*  He said it was, quote, gracious of Putin to accept me, to see me in Moscow. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=517.02s)]
*  He said, quote, I don't regard Putin as a bad guy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=522.44s)]
*  This is our negotiator. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=526.9s)]
*  This is the quality of tough guy genius the United States is bringing to the table for [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=529.5s)]
*  these supposedly tough guy negotiations with the Russians to end the war in Ukraine, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=534.1s)]
*  How's that going? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=539.82s)]
*  Well, let's see. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=540.82s)]
*  Let's just do a little math. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=541.82s)]
*  So far, since Trump has been back in office and since these negotiations have gotten underway, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=544.7s)]
*  the tough guy negotiations, but being tough with Russia to get them to stop the war in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=551.68s)]
*  So far, Trump has offered a few concessions. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=558.2s)]
*  He's announced that the U.S. is no longer enforcing foreign agents' law in this country. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=562.04s)]
*  He's announced that the U.S. is shutting down all of our anti-foreign influence operations [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=567.4s)]
*  at the Justice Department and the FBI. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=571.76s)]
*  He's announced that the U.S. is shutting down our so-called klepto-capture efforts [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=573.64s)]
*  to enforce sanctions versus Russia and stop them from evading sanctions. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=577.64s)]
*  Trump has talked about ending sanctions altogether against Russia. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=582.52s)]
*  Trump has said he wants Russia to rejoin the G7. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=585.88s)]
*  Last week, we learned that Trump has cut off the program that tracks the Ukrainian children [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=588.76s)]
*  that Russia kidnapped and took into Russian territory. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=594.24s)]
*  Trump is effectively telling Russia, hey, congratulations, you can keep the kids. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=597.8s)]
*  Trump has restarted diplomatic relations with Russia and said that Russia will soon be reopening [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  their embassy and all their U.S. consulates at full strength in the United States. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=607.2s)]
*  Trump shut down U.S. Cyber Command operations against Russia. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=612.26s)]
*  He shut down our joint efforts with Europe to counteract Russian sabotage efforts in [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=615.56s)]
*  Europe, which thus far have included multiple arson attacks and attempted assassination [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  and packing letter bombs onto international flights. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=624.4s)]
*  We're no longer working with our friends in Europe to try to stop those things. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=627.2399999999999s)]
*  Russia has reportedly asked for the U.S. to restart direct commercial flights between [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=631.4799999999999s)]
*  Moscow and the United States. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=636.1199999999999s)]
*  Trump hasn't said a word about that, but do you think he'll say no? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  And now today, Trump says, quote, the United States will help restore Russia's access [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=642.52s)]
*  to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=646.6s)]
*  The United States will assist Russia in obtaining lower maritime insurance costs. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=651.56s)]
*  And the United States will assist Russia in enhancing their access to ports and payment [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  systems for such transactions. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=662.84s)]
*  So that's so far what Trump has given up to Russia. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=666.84s)]
*  But hey, it's negotiation, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=671.96s)]
*  What did he get in exchange? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=674.84s)]
*  Well, there's no ceasefire or end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=676.6s)]
*  But yesterday, while those tough guy talks were underway in Saudi Arabia, Russia did [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=681.64s)]
*  happily shoot a bunch of missiles into Ukraine while the talks were actively underway. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=686.0s)]
*  And Trump did get a painting. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=693.88s)]
*  We are not dealing with the sharpest tools in the shed here at any level. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=699.32s)]
*  We in fact appear to be dealing with very profoundly dull tools. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  But it's our national security that they're destroying, not theirs. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=709.6400000000001s)]
*  And the American people are wise to it, which means if this system still works, it should [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  make all of this politically unsustainable. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1dVJpMMyE&t=720.34s)]
