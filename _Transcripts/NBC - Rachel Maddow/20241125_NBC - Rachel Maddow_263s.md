# 'A snake pit of jockeying egos' adds to 'a cornucopia of infighting and back-biting' on Team Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ)
*  So, about 10 days ago, New York Times published a profile of an adviser to president-elect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, a guy by the name of Boris Epstein. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=5.5s)]
*  They titled it, quote, the Trump lawyer who wields outsize influence on the next White [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=9.42s)]
*  House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=15.14s)]
*  Quote, there's nobody in the president-elect's orbit who at this point would doubt the level [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=16.14s)]
*  of Mr. Epstein's influence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=20.22s)]
*  He has quickly become one of the most powerful figures in the early days of the presidential [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  transition. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=26.18s)]
*  He's become a significant gatekeeper for Trump, including shaping some of the information [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=27.18s)]
*  he receives about personnel and cabinet selections. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=31.86s)]
*  Epstein was reportedly pivotal in securing the ultimately doomed nomination of Matt Gaetz [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=37.06s)]
*  to be attorney general of the United States, also the nomination of Trump's chosen White [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=42.82s)]
*  House counsel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=47.3s)]
*  Now, we've been through one Trump transition and one Trump administration before, so what [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=49.3s)]
*  comes next is as obvious to you as it is to me, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  In the snake pit of jockeying egos that Trump cultivates around himself, you know, if this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=59.4s)]
*  guy Boris is seen as ascendant right now in terms of his influence, then, of course, all [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=67.52s)]
*  of the other snakes are activated. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  All the other people in Trump's orbit will soon come for Boris, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=74.84s)]
*  It's inevitable. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=78.64s)]
*  It's like the sun rising in the east. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=79.64s)]
*  Somebody's important? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=82.36s)]
*  For long. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=84.24s)]
*  Cue today's headlines. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=85.24s)]
*  CNN first to report on allegations flying inside the Trump transition that old Boris [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=87.6s)]
*  has been trying to cash in on his proximity to Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Imagine what's described as, quote, an internal investigation by Trump lawyers reportedly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  found that Boris Epstein asked potential Trump cabinet nominees to pay him for his help getting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=104.58s)]
*  them nominated to pay him as much as $100,000 per month. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Among the people Epstein supposedly tried to shake down was Trump's ultimate nominee [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=116.52s)]
*  for Treasury Scott Bessent, who, at least according to this internal Trump, quote, legal [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=121.6s)]
*  review reportedly did not cough up the cash. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=127.16s)]
*  He reportedly did not pay Boris Epstein before being selected for the job. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=130.6s)]
*  There's even a report published in a super Trump-friendly right-wing outlet that Bessent, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  possibly in consultation with Vice President-elect JD Vance's office, he participated in kind [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  of an amateur sting operation against Boris Epstein in which he tried to get Epstein on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=146.56s)]
*  tape asking him for money in exchange for the nomination. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=152.28s)]
*  I should say MSNBC and NBC News have not confirmed any of this reporting. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  Boris Epstein, however, tells us, quote, I am honored to work for President Trump and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  with his team. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=168.11999999999998s)]
*  These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from making America [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  great again. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=173.92s)]
*  But of course it was going to be like this, right? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=174.92s)]
*  Of course the Trump transition and presumably the next Trump term will be a cornucopia of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  infighting and backbiting and Trump's allies all trying to sabotage each other not only [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=184.64s)]
*  in the press but any other underhanded way they can. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=190.08s)]
*  Of course it was going to be like this. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=195.12s)]
*  More seriously though, these allegations that Boris was collecting cash or trying to collect [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=196.52s)]
*  cash in exchange for getting people put in the cabinet, it raises the prospect that Trump [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=202.9s)]
*  cabinet offices are for sale, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=208.44s)]
*  The possibility that people would think there is a possibility of buying one because there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=211.58s)]
*  at least has now been a published price for what it takes to get one. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=215.86s)]
*  The internal review by Trump lawyers supposedly found that Epstein didn't get money from [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  anyone, that he wasn't able to collect his price for getting anybody installed in the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=225.22000000000003s)]
*  cabinet. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  That jibes with what we heard as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  But we have asked if we can see this supposed review. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=233.5s)]
*  Think they'll ever make it public? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=237.06s)]
*  Think they'll ever give it to us? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=239.34s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1T8A4MWggQ&t=241.66000000000003s)]
