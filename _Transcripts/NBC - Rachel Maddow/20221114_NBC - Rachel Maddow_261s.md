Video Description: Rachel Maddow notes the history of narrow majorities controlling the House of Representatives often leading to gridlock on trying to pass legislation, but Republicans don't have much of a legislative agenda anyway, so the narrow margin is fine for their purposes of using committee power to troll President Biden in the hopes of generating scandals for 2024.

# Narrow Margin Of Control Risks House Gridlock; Legislation Not A GOP Priority Anyway
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI)
*  Right now, according to NBC's projection, Republicans could get, say, 219 seats, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=0.0s)]
*  would give them a very, very, very tiny majority. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=8.16s)]
*  I should tell you that projection has a plus or—excuse me, it's 220 seats is the projection [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=11.32s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=15.8s)]
*  It has a margin of error, though, of plus or minus four seats. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=16.8s)]
*  And so even if they do get control, it's going to be a very, very, very, very slim [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=19.36s)]
*  majority. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=23.96s)]
*  We've seen a few tiny House majorities in history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=24.96s)]
*  The Washington Post actually did a good reminder today of when we have had really, really, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=28.44s)]
*  really wafer-thin majorities in the House in the past and what the consequences have [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=33.4s)]
*  been. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=38.04s)]
*  One of those rare instances was right as the U.S. entered World War I. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=39.24s)]
*  Another one was right around the events of 9-11. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=43.96s)]
*  In both of those cases, big world-changing world events ended up sort of outpacing what [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  was otherwise expected to be total partisan gridlock. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=51.64s)]
*  But there's other cases where partisan gridlock ended up being what held the day, and that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=55.52s)]
*  can be a very consequential thing, too. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=59.92s)]
*  In the spring and summer of 1932—we've talked about this a few other times on the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=62.6s)]
*  show—tens of thousands of U.S. veterans, World War I veterans, marched down Pennsylvania [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  Avenue and they set up camps outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  It of course was the Great Depression. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=76.08s)]
*  The veterans came to D.C. to demand bonuses that they were due. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=77.76s)]
*  The government had promised them bonuses for their active duty service, and they hadn't [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=81.76s)]
*  paid them out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=85.4s)]
*  And so the veterans came to Washington to get their money. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=86.4s)]
*  They called themselves the bonus army. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  It ended horribly when the veterans refused to leave. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=91.72s)]
*  President Herbert Hoover called in the U.S. military and sicced the military on them to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=94.68s)]
*  throw the veterans out bodily. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=99.12s)]
*  Now how did it get to that point, to that act of desperation by the veterans and that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  monstrous decision by President Hoover to sic the military on them? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, it was gridlock. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=110.2s)]
*  Congress had debated the awarding of those bonuses for years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  There was some congressional support for them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=115.36s)]
*  Republicans at the time were opposed to paying the bonuses. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=117.44s)]
*  They had a one seat majority in the Senate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=120.32s)]
*  That was enough to bottle it up in the Senate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=122.4s)]
*  The House had a Democratic majority, but it was a really small one. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=124.92s)]
*  It was a 219 to 212 majority in the House. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=128.04s)]
*  Too small of a majority for the Democrats to be able to get things done there either. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=131.18s)]
*  That's the sort of thing that can happen with a very, very slim majority in Congress, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=136.52s)]
*  particularly if you've got a slim majority in both Houses. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=140.36s)]
*  Unless you've got some sort of major world event that unites political enemies, partisanship [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=142.88s)]
*  can very easily block even very important stuff when majorities are that thin in Washington. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=147.32s)]
*  Now there's been a lot of discussion about what it would take for Republicans to be able [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  to pass legislation in a very narrow majority in the House. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=158.96s)]
*  I think in real politic today in 2022, looking at the House Republicans and what they want [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=163.56s)]
*  to do, I don't think anybody expects them to actually have real legislation that they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=168.6s)]
*  want and expect to pass. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=172.08s)]
*  I mean, even if they did have goals for legislation, they've been quiet about them thus far. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  They didn't run on those goals. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  And they're not going to want to pass anything that the Democratic controlled Senate would [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=179.44000000000003s)]
*  vote for anyway, let alone something that would be signed into law by Joe Biden. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=182.44s)]
*  What I think that means for a wafer thin Republican House majority in practical terms in all likelihood, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  it means that we will see them pass nothing in terms of legislation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=193.08s)]
*  The consequence of them having a majority, even a one seat majority, is that they will [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=198.52s)]
*  control the committees and they will therefore control subpoena power and they will therefore [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=203.4s)]
*  be able to turn themselves into an investigation machine, a scandal generating body of government [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=208.16s)]
*  where they investigate everything Joe Biden has ever done thought Eaton Drake or gestured [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=214.76s)]
*  at in his entire life. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=219.44s)]
*  That is going to be the consequence of the House going to the Republicans if in fact [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=221.8s)]
*  that is the way it goes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=226.12s)]
*  A narrow majority is a recipe for them passing nothing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=227.76s)]
*  I doubt they care very much about that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=231.0s)]
*  But even a one seat majority is what they need to be able to control the committees, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=233.0s)]
*  launch investigations, and honestly that's all they want anyway. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSMpuuza1SI&t=236.95999999999998s)]
