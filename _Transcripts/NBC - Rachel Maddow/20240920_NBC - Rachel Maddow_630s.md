# MAGA members of Georgia election board advance another step in Trump's election subversion scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ)
*  Today, in a marathon meeting in Georgia, the new pro-Trump majority of the Georgia state [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  election board, they passed a whole bunch of new rules, yet more new rules today, 46 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=6.12s)]
*  days out from the election, including one that requires a hand count of ballots. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=14.56s)]
*  I mean, reminder here that Georgia has 11 million people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I'll quote here from the Washington Post's coverage of this shock decision today in Georgia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Quote, democracy advocates accused the board of intentionally injecting chaos and uncertainty [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=29.8s)]
*  into the presidential contest. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=35.72s)]
*  Election supervisors and poll workers said hand counts would take too long, cost money, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=38.2s)]
*  and almost certainly produce counting errors. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=42.68s)]
*  The office of the Republican state attorney general, which is responsible for advising [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=45.32s)]
*  the board, wrote in an opinion that the change was, quote, unlawful. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=48.8s)]
*  Nevertheless, the board voted three to two to approve the measure. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=53.8s)]
*  Quote, research and practice have shown again and again that hand counting ballots is less [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=57.6s)]
*  accurate than machine tallies and that it can take days, weeks or months, depending on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=62.24s)]
*  the size of the jurisdiction. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Again, 11 million people in Georgia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=69.16s)]
*  Quote, critics say because the hand counting requirement would almost certainly inject [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=71.76s)]
*  error into the tabulation process, it could give county boards the evidence they need, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=75.44s)]
*  meaning the pretext they need, to delay certification. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=80.84s)]
*  Some questioned whether it amounts to intentional sabotage of state elections. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=85.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's one thing to say falsely that there's something wrong in the elections. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=91.28s)]
*  It's another thing to actually monkey wrench the works so that Georgia really can't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=95.2s)]
*  count its vote. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=102.84s)]
*  Radical stuff going on in Georgia. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=105.72s)]
*  Not just creating false propaganda about election problems that aren't there, but now moving [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=107.6s)]
*  on to actually creating real election problems for real. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=112.4s)]
*  They're going to try to make Georgia take months to count. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=116.96s)]
*  It's not just going to test our patience. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=121.76s)]
*  It would break the system, because if it's going to take months, at that point, the deadlines [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=123.96s)]
*  for Georgia and every other state producing their electoral votes will have long passed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=128.72s)]
*  The good news here is that Georgians turned out in significant numbers today to say no [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=137.12s)]
*  to this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=141.16s)]
*  The opposition at this event was sustained and articulate and very, very present. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=142.24s)]
*  And I can't help but believe that that matters. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=148.56s)]
*  The idea that you're not going to listen to the individuals that are charged with conducting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=152.28s)]
*  elections is absurd to me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=157.8s)]
*  We all have given our lives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=160.68s)]
*  Most of us work decades in these career paths. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=162.84s)]
*  And to say that we don't know what we're talking about, you wouldn't say that to any other [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=165.84s)]
*  professional. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=170.4s)]
*  I've stayed at a lot of Waffle houses in my life, but that does not qualify me to operate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  a Waffle house. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=176.44s)]
*  Listen to the experts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  Listen to the experts. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=180.8s)]
*  That was the local elections director from Douglas County, Georgia, today, speaking before [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=183.16s)]
*  the state elections board in Georgia, before that board voted on a whole bunch of new rules [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=187.96s)]
*  today that aim to pretty radically change the way elections are run in Georgia just [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=193.12s)]
*  a month and a half before Election Day. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=198.96s)]
*  The board held a public comment period today before taking the vote. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=201.16s)]
*  Dozens of people showed up to do what is essentially a civic duty in a circumstance like this to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=204.4s)]
*  tell the board face to face to be on the record, opposing these radical changes to essentially [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=210.12s)]
*  undo the state's election rules and processes right before the presidential race. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=216.16s)]
*  The recent actions of the board so chaos and dramatically undermine trust in our constitutional [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=222.84s)]
*  republic and its democratic processes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=230.48s)]
*  I'm glad to serve as a poll worker, even though it can be cumbersome, tiring and stressful [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=233.04s)]
*  at times. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  All of these proposals are attempting to remedy problems that don't exist. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=240.0s)]
*  This timeline is not just tight. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=244.04s)]
*  It is impossible. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=246.12s)]
*  Imagine the uncertainty and the confusion and the added burden on election workers and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=247.6s)]
*  county budgets. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=253.64s)]
*  These rules do not protect our elections. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  They undermine them. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  Your actions attempt to stack the deck for a particular outcome, and that is the definition [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  of anti-democratic. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=266.67999999999995s)]
*  I think what is happening is we are setting up our counties to fail. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  And when these counties fail, when there are inaccuracies, if there is a result of the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=273.84s)]
*  election that some of the members of this board do not like, they will be able to point [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=279.96s)]
*  to those inaccuracies and they will say that this is that the election is inaccurate, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=286.12s)]
*  that there is a lack of integrity in the election. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=292.96s)]
*  The last speaker there is a state representative in Georgia named Saira Draper. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=296.12s)]
*  She's telling the Georgia Election Board there essentially, hey, I'm onto you, that she [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=300.4s)]
*  believes the the motive behind what they're doing is not just to create an illusion that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  there's something wrong with Georgia's election results, but actually to set Georgia [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=308.4s)]
*  elections up to fail, to make the administration of this election so chaotic and so [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=312.56s)]
*  impossible that Georgia actually won't be able to produce a clear result. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=318.6s)]
*  And then they can point at that and say, ah, see, look at how these problems in our elections, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=324.0s)]
*  we should throw out the vote. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  Or at least we should fight over this and have this tied up in court so long that maybe [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=331.76s)]
*  the state's votes for the Electoral College never make it in time, never make it to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=337.24s)]
*  Washington in time for the Electoral College count. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=342.0s)]
*  Joining us now, I'm happy to say, is Saira Tindall-Gazel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=346.08s)]
*  She's the lone Democrat on the Georgia State Election Board. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=348.64s)]
*  She voted against the rule change today that requires hand counting the ballots. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=352.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. I know it's been a very, very long day and it's been a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=356.88s)]
*  very stressful period. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=360.08s)]
*  Well, I'm happy to be here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=363.12s)]
*  Can I just ask you if you feel like if I've been mischaracterizing anything that's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=365.76s)]
*  happened at the election border, if you feel like the public understanding broadly as the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=370.32s)]
*  nation's eyes sort of turn to Georgia, if there's been any fundamental misunderstandings [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=374.68s)]
*  about what's what's happening there, if you feel like those of us observing this from [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  afar pretty much understand what's going on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=382.24s)]
*  Well, the one thing I want to make sure is clear is we're not hand tabulating the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=385.56s)]
*  ballots, we're simply hand counting the number of ballots. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=390.6s)]
*  But again, you know, we're just weeks away from the election. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=394.2s)]
*  So for counties to try to retrain their poll workers and their poll managers, for them to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=398.8s)]
*  hire more workers because workers who've been out there for 14, 16 hours a day and are not in any [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=406.0s)]
*  shape to count thousands of ballots accurately, it's just absolutely untenable. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=414.6s)]
*  So I don't see any other explanation for this other than exactly as Representative Draper said, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=420.64s)]
*  which is setting counties up for failure. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=427.24s)]
*  I think a lot of people who've been watching what have been happening in Georgia, particularly now [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=430.92s)]
*  that the secretary of state has has weighed in and advised that some of these proposed changes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=434.56s)]
*  seem to be in contravention of Georgia law now that the attorney general's office have weighed in [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  and said this is beyond some of these changes or beyond the statutory authority of the board. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=444.64s)]
*  I think a lot of people are looking at that and thinking, well, the board is doing all these [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=448.92s)]
*  things, but none of it will stand that this will all get blocked by the courts, that Georgia's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=452.32s)]
*  elections won't be affected by the chaos that these rules, at least on paper, would seem to be [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=456.56s)]
*  injecting into the process. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=463.16s)]
*  Do you share that confidence? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=464.84s)]
*  Do you think the courts will essentially come to the rescue here and keep Georgia's normal [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=466.16s)]
*  election procedures in place? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=471.0s)]
*  Well, I certainly have hope that they will do that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=473.88s)]
*  Confidence, I'm not nearly as confident as some of the some of the commentary that I've seen and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=476.76s)]
*  read because it's a it's a really narrow window, both in terms of time and in terms of the legal [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=482.2s)]
*  theory, because there is it's hard to sue the state. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  There's sovereign immunity questions that that are that come into play. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=493.88s)]
*  The fact that my colleagues are willing to completely disregard advice of our counsel, we are [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=499.12s)]
*  represented by the attorney general's office. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=505.08s)]
*  We were told flat out that this was not a lawful use of our authority. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  That I found actually quite shocking. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  I wondered when I saw that today, especially when the chairman of the board who voted the same way [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=515.88s)]
*  that you did on most of these rule changes, when he explicitly noted at today's hearing, we are taking [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=522.08s)]
*  this action. If you vote in favor of this, this is in contravention of the legal advice we have been [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=528.12s)]
*  getting given about what we are legally allowed to do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=532.28s)]
*  I wondered if there might actually be potentially worries among the majority of the board that voted [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=535.04s)]
*  for those changes, that they might have been contravening Georgia law simply by taking this vote [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaUhgDA-uwQ&t=539.92s)]
