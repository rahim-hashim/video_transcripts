# Ukraine Seeks More 'Game Changer' U.S. Weapons Systems For Counteroffensive Against Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks)
*  When Russia started its war in Ukraine, the first big city they managed to control was the southern [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=0.0s)]
*  city, a southern port city called Kherson. Despite fierce Ukrainian resistance in the north and around [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=4.88s)]
*  the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Russian troops were able to capture Kherson in the south just a week [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=12.0s)]
*  into the war. Well now it's five months into the war and aided by some new high-powered American [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=18.16s)]
*  weaponry, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is promising a counteroffensive to retake Kherson, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=24.88s)]
*  to kick Russian troops out of that whole region. President Zelensky said this weekend that Ukrainian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  troops are advancing step by step that they've liberated 44 towns in the Kherson region so far. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=35.12s)]
*  They're doing so in part thanks to a new weapon they have just started using, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=42.4s)]
*  a weapon called High Mars, short for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=47.12s)]
*  High Mars are long-range precision-guided artillery launchers made in the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=53.76s)]
*  They've been provided to the Ukrainian military by the United States government. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=60.32s)]
*  And basically the way they work is it's pretty understandable even for those of us in a civilian [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=64.64s)]
*  context. This is a launcher that's mounted on a standard U.S. military truck. It takes just a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=69.6s)]
*  four-man crew to operate. But this thing can fire munitions with a range of about 50 miles, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=74.8s)]
*  the way they've been equipped and shipped to Ukraine. About a 50-mile range. But then importantly, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  as soon as it has fired its shot, the truck can take off. So the launcher won't be vulnerable to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=84.8s)]
*  routine fire. Within two minutes of a High Mars firing its shot, this truck-mounted launcher can [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=92.72s)]
*  be speeding away from the firing location at 60 miles per hour. So they can fire at long range [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=99.2s)]
*  in a very precise guided way. And then they can get away without having the weapon taken off the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=105.68s)]
*  battlefield by return fire from the enemy. Now the Washington Post reported this weekend, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=112.0s)]
*  quote, the High Mars have been so effective that the Russian defense ministry has ordered commanders [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=117.36s)]
*  to prioritize them for targeting. The U.S. has sent a dozen of these High Mars to Ukraine. The [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  administration just said it'll be sending four more for a total of 16. It's possible that the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=128.24s)]
*  Germans and the British are maybe sending a handful more. But Ukraine says these weapons are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  game-changing for them and they need a lot more. The Ukrainian minister of defense just said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=140.4s)]
*  quote, for an effective counteroffensive, we need at least 100. He said, quote, that would be a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=144.88s)]
*  game-changer. It's clear that U.S. provided weapons on the ground in Ukraine are already, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  it's clear that U.S. provided weapons already on the ground in Ukraine are doing the work [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=156.0s)]
*  they were intended to do. Ukraine was able to take out a Russian ship on the Black Sea. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=160.56s)]
*  They were eventually able to recapture Snake Island with a U.S.-made harpoon missile. Using [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=164.88s)]
*  these High Mars systems, Ukraine was able to destroy an important Russian command center for [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=170.96s)]
*  aerial operations that they say has drastically resulted in, drastically reduced Russian artillery [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=176.48s)]
*  fire from over the horizon. A congressional delegation that visited Ukraine this weekend [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=182.48s)]
*  also got to see how those weapons are being used. Among them was Democratic congresswoman [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin. She has a special connection with Ukraine as her state, Michigan, has a large [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=191.12s)]
*  Ukrainian-American population. But her state is also one of the places where soldiers are trained [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=196.64s)]
*  in how to use the High Mars system. She made a point of that during her visit by giving President [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=201.76s)]
*  Zelensky a challenge coin from a High Mars unit of the Michigan National Guard. Representative [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  Alyssa Slotkin, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate you making the time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=211.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. So you've got an impressive defense and intelligence background, and I'm sure [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=215.12s)]
*  this stuff is easy for you to follow, easy for you to grok in terms of all the jargon and everything. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  But can you explain to our audience why it is that the Ukrainian government, President Zelensky, are [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=225.68s)]
*  so interested in this one U.S. weapons system that they have just started to obtain and that does have [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  a connection to your home state of Michigan? Yeah, I mean, I think it basically gives them [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=240.16s)]
*  the ability for precision fires in a way that they just didn't have before. You know, you talked about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=245.68s)]
*  the range, 50 miles. I think what's been interesting is that the Russians have backed up that range, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=251.76s)]
*  right? Those 50 miles, it's pushed them back in a way that I think it's been different. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=257.6s)]
*  And it just brings them a new capability that's longer range, more precise, and then those High [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=262.56s)]
*  Mars can move. As you said, it's scoot and shoot or shoot and scoot, and they can just get out of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=266.88s)]
*  where they were. And they're very accurate. And so it's just bringing a new capability to them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=272.08s)]
*  that they haven't had before. And they're using to good effect. Do you believe that the U.S. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=277.6s)]
*  is capable of shipping them a lot more? I don't know much about these weapons in terms of what [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=284.96s)]
*  the procurement process is like from what I'm able to read and sort of open source stuff. It seems [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=289.92s)]
*  like they're about $5 million a pop. It seems like there are sort of open source estimates that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=294.4s)]
*  maybe the U.S. has a few hundred of them in our arsenal. But they've been around for decades. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  They've been around since the 90s. It's not like they're a brand new, highly precision [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  weapon that we've only got a handful of. Do you think we're capable of giving them as many [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=308.4s)]
*  more as they want? Well, no, not as many more as they want. And when you're talking about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=312.64s)]
*  hundreds upon hundreds, I mean, the planners at the Pentagon have to make sure that we don't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  cut into bone for U.S. defenses, right, that we don't leave ourselves vulnerable. We're giving [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=321.68s)]
*  the Ukrainians a lot of different things, including high Mars. And so the Pentagon has to make [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=325.76s)]
*  decisions all the time on what can we give them from our inventory? Do other partner nations have [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=330.48s)]
*  similar systems that they can give them? I did this with the counter-ISIS campaign. It's often [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=335.92s)]
*  figuring out what kind of risk you can take. I think there is a question on the table about [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=341.44s)]
*  whether we give them a longer range rocket that goes on the same high Mars. It's called an Atacom. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=345.84s)]
*  It would be a longer range, 190 miles instead of 50. That's something that the Ukrainians asked us [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  for. President Zelensky asked us for. It's something that I know the administration is having [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  conversations about. I'm certainly in support of that. But, you know, it's not any one system [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=362.55999999999995s)]
*  that's going to make a counter-offensive work, particularly in a place like, you know, southern [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=366.96s)]
*  Ukraine. It's got to be a whole lot of things that come together. And it's a complicated thing [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=371.68s)]
*  to go and take back territory when the Russians have, you know, really tried to dig themselves in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=376.48s)]
*  down south. Congresswoman Alyssa Slotkin, who just returned from Ukraine, including meeting with [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  President Zelensky, thanks for helping us understand this. I feel like Americans do really care about [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  this war. Being able to understand the decisions that the American government can make about what [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  we can do and what we can't is a really important part of staying engaged with the reality here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand. Thanks. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6jSMHeCgks&t=401.04s)]
