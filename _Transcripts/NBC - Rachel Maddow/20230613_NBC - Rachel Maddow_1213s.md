# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 12
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M)
*  And people say now, wow, we've never had a president trying to tear down the justice [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=0.0s)]
*  system and attack federal law enforcement officials like Trump is now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=5.82s)]
*  Yes, we have. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=9.52s)]
*  We definitely have, except he was vice president, not president when he did it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=11.18s)]
*  His name was Spiro Agnew, and he was facing a 40-count federal criminal felony indictment [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=15.32s)]
*  in 1973. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=22.46s)]
*  Because of these tactics which have been employed against me, because small and fearful men have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=26.46s)]
*  been frightened into furnishing evidence against me, they have perjured themselves. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  In many cases, it's my understanding. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=43.7s)]
*  I will not resign if indicted. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  I will not resign if indicted. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  The crowd goes wild. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=52.14s)]
*  The Washington Post and the New York Times headlines page A1 in both papers the next day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=56.94s)]
*  Agnew declares he will not quit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=61.68s)]
*  Agnew declares he will not resign even if indicted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=64.26s)]
*  Eleven days later, he resigned. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=70.1s)]
*  Now, this is the crucial point, I think, at least today. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=73.38s)]
*  I think it is crucial to know that the Justice Department at that time, when they were putting [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=79.54s)]
*  together all of this voluminous hard evidence against Agnew, they believed that in this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=86.54s)]
*  vice president, Agnew, they were looking at a man who had committed dozens of felonies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  And they believed they were looking at a man who had a very good shot at being the next [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=98.78s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=102.34s)]
*  Not only because vice presidents tend to run for the top job themselves after serving as [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=104.48s)]
*  vice president, sometimes that works out, sometimes it doesn't. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=110.14s)]
*  But in Agnew's case, there was an even more immediate expectation that he was going to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  become president. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=118.56s)]
*  The Justice Department had very good reason to expect in 1973 that Nixon was going down. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=121.12s)]
*  The Watergate scandal was getting worse and worse and worse. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=128.1s)]
*  Nixon was pretty unhealthy by then in lots of ways. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=131.28s)]
*  His behavior was erratic and strange, which is something that top officials of the Justice [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=134.48s)]
*  Department saw personally in their interactions with Nixon, including the attorney general [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=139.24s)]
*  himself. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=144.16s)]
*  I mean, it just seemed like very good odds that if Nixon didn't keel over, there was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=145.16s)]
*  a very good prospect that he was going to be out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=150.48s)]
*  He was going to resign or he was going to be forced out of office by impeachment, which [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=153.36s)]
*  would of course make his vice president president. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=157.44s)]
*  And his vice president, the Justice Department believed, had committed dozens of felonies [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=162.56s)]
*  and they had the evidence to back it up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  So just think about that moment in time for a second. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=171.64s)]
*  I mean, think of that moment in time in relation to where we are today with Trump about to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=173.6s)]
*  be arraigned on 37 felony counts tomorrow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=178.48s)]
*  I mean, we've got Trump saying right now, I will not suspend my campaign because of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=182.04s)]
*  this indictment. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=187.08s)]
*  I will never drop out of this campaign. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=188.08s)]
*  He said this weekend, I will continue to run for president not only after I'm indicted, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  I will continue to run for president even if I'm convicted. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  That's what Trump's saying now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=200.08s)]
*  In Agnew's case, you just heard him say it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=201.36s)]
*  I will not resign if indicted. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=204.12s)]
*  Very same kind of pledge. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=206.36s)]
*  But think about how that would work in practical terms. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=208.56s)]
*  I mean, think about that with the Agnew case. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Basically given that, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, we now know that Nixon [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=216.64s)]
*  was out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=219.64s)]
*  Nixon didn't get to the end of this term. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=220.64s)]
*  He was forced out by the Watergate scandal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  Think about what that would have meant with Agnew not resigning if indicted. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=229.04s)]
*  They've got all the evidence against him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=230.44s)]
*  Justice Department indicts him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=232.16s)]
*  He says he won't resign. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  If indicted, so, okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's say they pressed on and they went to trial. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  He would very likely be convicted on dozens of felony counts. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=241.14s)]
*  They had very hard evidence against him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  So he'd be convicted. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=246.32s)]
*  He'd get sentenced to jail, quite possibly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=247.56s)]
*  It was dozens of felonies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  It's not like Espionage Act felonies, but still is bad. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  If he doesn't resign, he goes on trial, he gets convicted and then sentenced to jail, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=255.7s)]
*  then he's the vice president of the United States in jail. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=263.4s)]
*  And from jail, what the Justice Department is expecting about Nixon comes true. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=269.8s)]
*  Nixon goes poof from the presidency. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=274.58s)]
*  And so now, post-Nixon, we've got the new president governing from jail, from federal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=276.46s)]
*  prison. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=283.14s)]
*  Or maybe now that Agnew's president, he tries to pardon himself from prison, but nobody [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=284.14s)]
*  really knows how that would work. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=290.06s)]
*  Can you do that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=291.38s)]
*  Would people obey the order that he proclaimed himself pardoned? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=292.38s)]
*  It would be chaos. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  So what do you do in that circumstance if you're the U.S. Department of Justice? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=298.84s)]
*  What do you do as the Justice Department? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  When you believe you've got someone who you believe has committed dozens of felonies, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  felonies in this case that he was only able to commit because he held public office. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  It was only because he was a high-ranking public official that he was allowed access [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=317.06s)]
*  to these things that allowed him to commit these crimes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=321.58s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=325.26s)]
*  Do you just prosecute this guy like anyone else? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=326.26s)]
*  I mean, at a base level, yes, nobody's above the law. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=329.3s)]
*  We only have one system of law for everyone. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=334.54s)]
*  Nothing about being an elected official gives you a license to commit crimes or a license [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=337.06s)]
*  to get away with it if you do. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=342.06s)]
*  The last time we had to contend with something very much like this as a country, the three [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=345.78s)]
*  young idealistic prosecutors who had run this case, who had documented all the bribery and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  extortion claims against Agnew, who had amassed all the evidence for trial, they wanted not [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=357.7s)]
*  only to put him on trial, they wanted to convict him and put him in jail. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=362.34s)]
*  But what the Justice Department offered the guy was no jail. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=366.58s)]
*  It is a decision that is controversial to this day and for good reason, but that's what [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=372.18s)]
*  they did. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  The Justice Department insisted that the evidence of all his alleged crimes be made public and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=376.94s)]
*  put in writing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=383.12s)]
*  That's what I showed at the very top of the hour. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=384.53999999999996s)]
*  They put that in writing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=387.42s)]
*  They introduced it in open court. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  They released it to the public. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=390.1s)]
*  It was printed in all the papers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=391.42s)]
*  But in addition to, you know, printing all that evidence they had of his crimes, they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=393.94s)]
*  didn't do much else. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=399.98s)]
*  They let him plead to just one count of tax evasion, and they agreed he would serve zero [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=401.5s)]
*  jail time. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=407.86s)]
*  In exchange for that, what he had to agree to was to leave elective office, to resign. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=410.2s)]
*  Here was the front page of the New York Times. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=419.32s)]
*  Spiro T. Agnew resigned as Vice President of the United States today under an agreement [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=421.08s)]
*  with the Department of Justice to admit evasion of federal income taxes and avoid imprisonment. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=425.08s)]
*  The stunning development, ending a federal grand jury investigation of Mr. Agnew and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=430.34s)]
*  terminating his political career, shocked his closest associates and precipitated an [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=436.0s)]
*  immediate search by President Nixon for a successor. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=441.36s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=445.12s)]
*  They didn't, as part of the plea deal, they didn't require him to swear that he would [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=447.4s)]
*  never run for public office again. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=452.16s)]
*  That's why the Times said this deal had probably terminated his political career. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=455.08s)]
*  But they did make him resign from the office he was then holding. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=461.34s)]
*  They figured that the shame of that would be enough to keep him from ever getting elected [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  to anything again. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=470.88s)]
*  His supporters were so mad in the wake of that deal. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=474.46000000000004s)]
*  You might have thought for a minute that they would vote for him again if they could. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=478.78000000000003s)]
*  In the immediate aftermath of Agnew's plea deal, he's not going to prison, but he does [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=494.04s)]
*  have to resign office immediately. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=520.32s)]
*  In the immediate aftermath of that deal, his supporters were so strongly in support [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=522.32s)]
*  of him, they were so upset at the charges against him, you might have thought the country [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=527.32s)]
*  was on the precipice of something terrible. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=532.24s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=534.2800000000001s)]
*  It passed. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=535.2800000000001s)]
*  It took a little while. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=536.2800000000001s)]
*  He stayed in the news for a few weeks, a few months. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  He was very mad about what had happened to him. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  But then he just faded out. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=543.62s)]
*  He disappeared. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  His name all but disappeared from history. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  But it hasn't entirely disappeared. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=550.62s)]
*  We do have his example. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=552.72s)]
*  We have had experience with something like this before as a country. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=554.84s)]
*  And whether you like how that worked out with him or not, whether you think that was justice [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=558.82s)]
*  or not, that is the real history of how the U.S. Department of Justice contended with [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=563.4s)]
*  these issues the last time they were confronted with something like this. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=569.2s)]
*  Here was a man who fully expected himself to be the next president of the United States. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=573.3s)]
*  The U.S. Justice Department also expected that he might be about to become the next [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=580.52s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=584.42s)]
*  But the Justice Department also had evidence that he had committed dozens of felonies. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=586.06s)]
*  He went nuts about the fact they were investigating him. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=590.5799999999999s)]
*  He threatened them nine ways to Sunday. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  He tried to shut down that investigation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=595.64s)]
*  He tried to bully them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=597.78s)]
*  He said he was going to come after them and turn the tables on them. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=598.86s)]
*  But they did not back down. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  They confronted him with the evidence in court. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=602.98s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=605.06s)]
*  He pled. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  He pled to avoid jail. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=609.22s)]
*  And they let him because he also agreed to leave public office. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=612.0s)]
*  We have only ever done something like this once before as a country. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=616.98s)]
*  And that's how we did it the last time. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=621.32s)]
*  Now, does this mean that the Justice Department today is going to approach this the second [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=624.32s)]
*  time around, this time with Trump, the same way they did with Agnew? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=631.9200000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=635.86s)]
*  But the idea that Trump might plead, that he might negotiate to plead to something in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=638.26s)]
*  exchange for lenience, that's something that's generally being dismissed out of hand right [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=643.4s)]
*  now when perhaps it shouldn't be. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=649.22s)]
*  Particularly if it looks like there's a chance of jail time that attends to these charges [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=651.5s)]
*  for him, particularly if pleading guilty to something might be his only way to avoid jail time. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=656.1800000000001s)]
*  The question of whether or not Trump's future eligibility for public office might be part [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=663.78s)]
*  of any such plea is something that everybody's afraid to touch with a 10-foot pole, I know. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=669.48s)]
*  But we really have only ever done this once before. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=676.64s)]
*  And that's the way we did it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=681.14s)]
*  We made his public office, his holding public office, part of the plea deal. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=682.98s)]
*  That's the solution. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=691.16s)]
*  The still controversial to this day solution that the Justice Department and the lawyers [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=692.24s)]
*  for the defendant came up with 50 years ago, the last time we were plagued with a problem [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=696.62s)]
*  this disgusting. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  And it's no use pretending that that isn't the relevant history here. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=703.62s)]
*  It is. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=706.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think we should not look that gift horse in the mouth. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=709.6999999999999s)]
*  I think history is here to help. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=713.18s)]
*  The three federal prosecutors from Baltimore who ran the Agnew investigation, who amassed [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  all the evidence against him enough to put him in jail for a long time before the plea [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=721.98s)]
*  deal let him escape jail in exchange for leaving public service. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=726.96s)]
*  Those three prosecutors are Barney Skolnick, Tim Baker, and Ron Liebman. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=732.32s)]
*  If anyone in the whole country has ever been here before, it's these guys. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=737.2s)]
*  Joining us now live is one of those men from the center of that story, Ron Liebman, former [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  Assistant U.S. Attorney in Baltimore. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  Mr. Liebman, it's nice to see you. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=748.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being here tonight. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=750.34s)]
*  Great pleasure to be here. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=751.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=753.58s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if I got anything wrong there. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=754.58s)]
*  I know I didn't tell the whole story, but the parts of it that I told, did I get anything [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=757.38s)]
*  wrong or the wrong way around? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=760.5s)]
*  No, no, you got it right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=761.9000000000001s)]
*  You got it right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=763.6400000000001s)]
*  It is a bedrock principle that no one is above the law. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=765.22s)]
*  There's only one system of law for everybody. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  How did you guys square that with the fact that Agnew had this very valuable thing to [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=771.6s)]
*  trade effectively? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  He had this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=779.52s)]
*  He had his public office to trade to keep himself from going to jail. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=780.52s)]
*  That is something that nobody else would have. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, my team members, Barney Skolnick, Tim Baker, and I argued vociferously for days [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=788.04s)]
*  with the Attorney General and his staff about this very point. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=796.76s)]
*  We felt strongly, very strongly, that Agnew wasn't above the law. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=801.5999999999999s)]
*  He committed crimes. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=808.1s)]
*  He should go to trial. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=809.1s)]
*  He gets convicted. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=810.82s)]
*  He gets acquitted. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=811.82s)]
*  He gets his day in court. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=812.82s)]
*  The Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, to his credit, gave us as much time as we wanted. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=816.46s)]
*  We argued with him for days. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=823.2s)]
*  The three of us finally came to the conclusion that he was right, that he had the maturity [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=826.0200000000001s)]
*  of judgment at the time, given what was going on, to approve this deal. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=831.66s)]
*  Agnew had a get out of jail card. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  He was in elective office. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  Anyone could see that Richard Nixon was not long for that office. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  And so there would be the specter of the Vice President under indictment, perhaps at trial, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=848.6s)]
*  perhaps convicted, becoming the President of the United States. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=855.36s)]
*  And then, because of Justice Department policy, not law, he would be immune from prosecution [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=859.42s)]
*  while he was in office. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=865.78s)]
*  This is in the middle of Watergate. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  The country was in a constitutional crisis. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=870.28s)]
*  We, the three of us, Barney, Timmy, and I, finally came around to understanding and agreeing [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=873.56s)]
*  that at the time, what was going on there, that was the right call. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=879.5799999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is a contender. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=885.04s)]
*  He's not in elective office. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=886.78s)]
*  He may become the Republican nominee. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=889.74s)]
*  His betting is that he will. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=893.76s)]
*  He may or may not get elected at the time of the election. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=896.36s)]
*  If he is the Republican nominee, even if he is elected, he could have been tried for this [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=899.9599999999999s)]
*  espionage case. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=905.72s)]
*  He could well have other indictments pending against him. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=906.92s)]
*  Could even be possible that he would be convicted and sentenced to jail, and you'd have the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=911.72s)]
*  specter. And here's where there's a similarity, Rachel. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=916.18s)]
*  You have the specter of President Trump running the White House while doing time in the big [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=919.38s)]
*  house. That would be terrible. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=925.5s)]
*  However, it's not Watergate. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=928.78s)]
*  We're not in a constitutional crisis. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=931.1s)]
*  The fact that Trump would become president, if there's a fair election and he's elected, I [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=933.02s)]
*  know for Mr. Trump, it's only a fair election if he wins. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=940.9s)]
*  But if there's a fair election and he becomes president, that's democracy. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=944.88s)]
*  He becomes president doesn't mean he stays president. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=948.6800000000001s)]
*  It depends on what he does. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=952.64s)]
*  He is likely to be wrathful and vindictive. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=954.2800000000001s)]
*  He will certainly try to kick the wheels off of the Lady Liberty's wagon. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  He doesn't necessarily remain president. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=964.5200000000001s)]
*  He could be impeached depending upon what Congress is in session. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  There's the 25th Amendment that could be used. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=970.72s)]
*  So there are similarities, but I think there are fundamental differences as well. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=973.74s)]
*  Trump is not in office now. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=980.34s)]
*  He is a contender. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=983.22s)]
*  There are a lot of moving parts to this, and we'll have to see what happens. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=985.02s)]
*  I do think and I know that my colleagues think that we made the right decision at the right [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=988.62s)]
*  time for what for what was going on. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=993.26s)]
*  These times are a bit different and there's a lot to play out yet. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=997.26s)]
*  And Ron, in terms of the when you say you and your colleagues believe that was the right [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1000.64s)]
*  decision at the right time in terms of your understanding of the legacy of the Agnew [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1004.28s)]
*  decision within the Justice Department, is that viewed as having been the wise decision? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1009.88s)]
*  I ask only because we have to think now about whether the Justice Department might be [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1015.8s)]
*  considering something along those same lines in any potential plea negotiation with [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1021.4799999999999s)]
*  former President Trump. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  Obviously, anything can be part of a plea negotiation. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1030.26s)]
*  An agreement to not stand for public office would be somewhat parallel to the sort of [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1034.22s)]
*  agreement that came with Agnew in terms of him resigning the office he then helped. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1039.5s)]
*  I think I think the Justice Department, to answer the first part of your question, felt [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1045.02s)]
*  that the plea agreement with Agnew was the right thing in terms of a plea agreement with [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1050.1s)]
*  Donald Trump. First of all, keep in mind that, you know, he is the Roy Cohn School of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1058.52s)]
*  behavior. So he fights everything no matter what, no matter where to the very end, anyone [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1064.0s)]
*  who crosses him or he thinks crosses him, he goes after. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1072.04s)]
*  So it's very likely that that he actually will go to trial thinking that that only [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1076.36s)]
*  enhances his chances of getting elected because of how his base will react. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1081.72s)]
*  But if he were to for the same kind of reasons, I think that Agnew had not want to go to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1087.78s)]
*  jail. I mean, nobody wants to go to jail. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1095.26s)]
*  White collar defendants really don't want to go to jail. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1097.6200000000001s)]
*  They don't want to do time. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1100.54s)]
*  So if he would authorize his lawyers, let's say hypothetically, to offer an Agnew like [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1102.14s)]
*  plea deal wherein Trump would agree for a global settlement, which with all the cases [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1108.38s)]
*  that are pending, I don't know how that would work. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1114.92s)]
*  But let's say he would say, tell his lawyers, I will agree not to run for office if you [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1116.88s)]
*  drop these charges against me or I can plead no look and tendery to some jaywalking [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1122.76s)]
*  offense. I'm not sure the Justice Department would, you know, in this context would go [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1127.88s)]
*  along with that. I hope they wouldn't, because that feeds into the rhetoric that the [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1133.5600000000002s)]
*  prosecution that the Department of Justice is bringing is a weaponization. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1138.44s)]
*  It's it's it's a illegitimate prosecution just so that Donald Trump won't run for [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1143.08s)]
*  office again. That's a different situation than Agnew, I believe. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1148.98s)]
*  And I don't think the Justice Department, I hope they wouldn't agree to do that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1153.62s)]
*  Ron Liebman, former assistant U.S. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1158.86s)]
*  Attorney for the District of Maryland, a member of the team that prosecuted Spiro Agnew, a [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1160.62s)]
*  man with a place in history. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1165.1s)]
*  Ron, it's really good to have you here tonight. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1167.62s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking to us about this. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1169.62s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. Pleasure to be here. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1171.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh5s4fqO6M&t=1201.26s)]
