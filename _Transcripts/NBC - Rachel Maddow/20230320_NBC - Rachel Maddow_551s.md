# U.S. takes politician indictments in stride; Trump case should be no different: Maddow
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs)
*  That person is the attorney general of the great state of Texas, and that is in fact his mugshot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is Ken. He was indicted and booked into the Cullen County Jail in Texas on felony securities fraud charges a few years ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=5.68s)]
*  Those felony charges are still pending against him. He is still under indictment on multiple felony counts, but it hasn't held him back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=15.76s)]
*  Since that mugshot was taken, since he has been under felony indictment, Mr. Ken Paxton has run for re-election as Texas Attorney General twice, and he has won both times. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I mean, eventually, presumably, he will go on trial on multiple felony counts, but at least so far, Texas Republican voters don't mind that he's under indictment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=35.52s)]
*  And judging from the look on his face, it doesn't seem to be bugging him much either. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=46.32s)]
*  Even if you just want to stay in Texas, there's a whole bunch of these. This is the very nice mugshot. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=52.08s)]
*  Not that the composition isn't good, there's a little too much headroom here, but the tie looks fantastic. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=57.36s)]
*  This is the mugshot of a man who was indicted in Texas in 2014 while he was serving as governor of Texas. His name is Rick. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=62.08s)]
*  After he was indicted in 2014, he got fingerprinted, he got this nice mugshot taken with the perfect knot in his tie. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=69.52s)]
*  Just a few months later, he announced he was running for president of the United States while he was still under felony indictment. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=78.0s)]
*  In fact, for the duration of his 2016 Republican presidential campaign, Rick Perry was under felony indictment. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  They did not drop the felony charges against him until a few months after he had dropped out of the presidential race. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=92.64s)]
*  But even still, no big whoop. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=100.0s)]
*  Donald Trump went on to name him secretary of energy for the United States, which is a fact that is still just as amazing to behold as his mugshot is lovely. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=101.52s)]
*  Also staying in Texas, do you remember Tom DeLay? He was the majority leader of the Republican Party in the U.S. House of Representatives. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=112.88s)]
*  He had to resign that job to have this mugshot taken after a warrant was issued for his arrest in 2005. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=120.96s)]
*  As mugshots go though, it's kind of another nice one. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=128.32s)]
*  Not as nice as this one though. This is former Democratic vice presidential nominee and Democratic senator John Edwards. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=132.0s)]
*  That's his mugshot from 2011. Looking good, John Edwards. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=139.12s)]
*  Not looking as good, this is Dan, Mr. Rostenkowski. He was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in Congress for 13 years. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=144.8s)]
*  Until he had to stop doing that because it was time for him to stop being a congressman and to start being prisoner number 25338-016. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=154.4s)]
*  It happens. It happens a lot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=162.64s)]
*  Here was Bernie Carrick, New York police commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giuliani. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=167.68s)]
*  On Giuliani's recommendation, President George W. Bush tried to make this guy homeland security secretary of the United States. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=172.4s)]
*  Before that had to end in favor of his new designation as prisoner number 210-717. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=180.32s)]
*  It happens. It happens. It happens all the time in our country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=185.92s)]
*  So much so that we have kind of a thing in mind when we think about what an elected official's mugshot looks like. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=189.68s)]
*  I mean, there are ones that are more special than others. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=196.48s)]
*  The Congressman James Trafiquant mugshot will always be remembered more as kind of a hairdo Hall of Fame thing than a congressman thing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  Wow, it's still really something all these years later. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=208.56s)]
*  But apart from him, I mean, there is something familiar enough about seeing members of Congress and governors and senators mugshots that we recognize them as a look, right? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  It's a thing. We've seen a lot of these. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=225.68s)]
*  And none of these mugshots, none of these arrests, arraignments, fingerprinting of these public officials caused the world to end. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=228.32s)]
*  The arrests of these governors and senators and congressmen ended up posing zero threat to our republic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  As it should be. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=247.92s)]
*  So why would that be any different now? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=249.92s)]
*  Yes, if former President Donald Trump is indicted in federal court in D.C. or in state court in Georgia or in state court in New York or anywhere else. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=251.92s)]
*  Yes, it would be unprecedented for there to be an indictment issued against a U.S. president or former president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=260.56s)]
*  But we should also be real about the extent of exactly how historic this would be. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  Because we arrest public officials all the time in this country. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=272.88s)]
*  And under the law, there's nothing mattering about the extent of historical history. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=276.24s)]
*  There's nothing magical about being a former president. That's not a thing under the law. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=281.84s)]
*  Once you're a former anything, you're then just a citizen again and you are subject to all the same laws as every other American. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=286.0s)]
*  But whether you like Mr. Trump or you do not like him, it is both fair play and relevant. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  And it is starting to feel important to remember that our politics broadly is absolutely full of public officials. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=300.55999999999995s)]
*  Current and former public officials, both parties, neither party, every state in the union. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=308.96s)]
*  We are full of current and former public officials who have been charged with all kinds of crimes and convicted of everything imaginable. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=314.56s)]
*  Members of Congress and senators and governors, even a serving attorney general like these guys, but also state legislators, big city mayors, statewide elected officials, cabinet officials, White House officials. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=321.92s)]
*  It happens. It happens all the time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=332.56s)]
*  And while that's bad, it turns out we've had a lot of crooks in public office. That doesn't feel great. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=335.44s)]
*  What's good about it is that we know how to deal with it when it happens. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=343.36s)]
*  It doesn't break our system. It does not break our country to bring serious charges. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=349.36s)]
*  Against public officials and former public officials, even these exact charges that are reportedly on deck against former President Donald Trump in New York. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=356.4s)]
*  You will recall that this guy, a former senator, a Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, he was brought up on charges almost exactly like what's being reported about allegations against former President Trump. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=364.08s)]
*  John Edwards was brought up on charges for lying about and concealing a hush money payment that was made to cover up an alleged affair before an election. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=376.8s)]
*  Those exact charges were brought against a Democratic vice presidential nominee and former senator. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=386.32s)]
*  And you know what? You forgot about it because the country wasn't exactly rocked to its foundations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=391.6s)]
*  Another serving vice president, serving vice president, went up against a 40 count felony indictment for crimes committed while he was in office. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=399.04s)]
*  With him, they forced him to resign his office as part of a plea deal in federal criminal court. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  I did a podcast and a book about it, and it blew everybody's mind because we'd completely forgotten about it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=413.24s)]
*  Because it didn't create a lasting problem for us as a country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=419.12s)]
*  It does not bend the Constitution, let alone break it, to indict criminals for crimes, even when the alleged criminal is someone who has been elected to do a very important job. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  It is run of the mill public corruption law enforcement in this country, and we do it all the time. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=432.96s)]
*  And there is no reason why a former president should be magically immune from the same legal system that just in the past three years has put handcuffs on at least 13 state senators, 17 state representatives, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=437.6s)]
*  one serving congressman, one former congressman, the Delaware state auditor, the North Carolina Republican Party chair, the insurance commissioner of Georgia and too many city counselors, alderman county executives and mayors to count. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  It happens all the time. It really does not have to be the end of the world. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=463.68s)]
*  And anybody telling you that if there is an indictment of this particular former public official, there will be a protest like you've never seen before. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  There will be civil war. There will be an unstoppable uprising among his supporters and violence and all the rest. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=475.32000000000005s)]
*  Anybody telling you that that is the consequence of him being potentially indicted? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, that person may be wishing for that, but there's no reason that something like that is inevitable. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=488.56s)]
*  This is not something coming up that is extraneous to our system that we need to invent something new to contend with. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=494.64s)]
*  The bottom line here is that prosecuting public officials and former public officials, it happens all the time in the United States of America, and it never engenders violence and it never endangers the country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=502.0s)]
*  And it doesn't require our legal system to be fundamentally rethought or dismantled. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  Unless someone wants to try to gin that up. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=520.12s)]
*  And that is what we are contending with now with this particular former public official. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKToGAKYgzs&t=525.8s)]
