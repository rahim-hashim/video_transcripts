# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 21
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw)
*  Turns out the former leader does not snap his fingers and command a nationwide crippling uprising in his or her name. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, even in our country where he promised he would, where he promised that would happen, where he overtly publicly tried to make it happen, it failed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=9.0s)]
*  He failed. He wanted that. He promised it. He was counting on it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=17.0s)]
*  And therefore a lot of the country was counting on that being a consequence of this part of the process. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=21.0s)]
*  It hasn't happened. The dog did not bark. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=26.0s)]
*  And so that does sort of settle one big part of this, this existential question for us at this crime scene. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=29.0s)]
*  Right. This, this existential question for our country and our democracy, for our form of government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=41.0s)]
*  Will we be able to survive bringing criminal charges against this particular alleged criminal, given his political power and his hold on his followers? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=46.0s)]
*  Will we be able to try a man for his alleged crimes without riots in the streets, without the threat of civil war? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=54.0s)]
*  Turns out, yes, yes, we can. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=63.0s)]
*  Despite what he threatened to do, despite what he promised to do, he tried to do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=66.0s)]
*  He could not pull it off, which is good news for our democracy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=72.0s)]
*  The bad news is that instead we're getting something else, not mass violence again, like we saw on January 6, not even mass protest. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=77.0s)]
*  But instead, what we are getting is individual acts, both violence and threats of violence by radicalized people and groups that support him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=89.0s)]
*  We saw it last year when a man who was enraged by the Mar-a-Lago search warrant shot his way into an Ohio FBI office and was then killed in a shootout outside Cincinnati. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=102.0s)]
*  We saw it a week and a half ago when another armed man was shot and killed by the FBI, this time in Utah, when they served a search warrant and arrest warrant on him in response to his threats to kill President Biden and also New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg, who had brought the first indictment against Donald Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=113.0s)]
*  Then last week, a Massachusetts man pled guilty in federal court that that after the election, he sent bomb threats, death threats to this Arizona official, to Katie Hobbs, who was then the Democratic secretary of state in Arizona and who is now the Democratic governor of Arizona. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=130.0s)]
*  That man pled guilty in federal court last week. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=148.0s)]
*  He will be facing five years in prison when he is sentenced this fall. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=151.0s)]
*  Then it was Alvin Texas last week, a woman arrested for phoning in a death threat to the chambers of the federal judge who is overseeing the other federal case against Trump in federal district court in Washington. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=155.0s)]
*  The woman admitted threatening to kill the judge and then also volunteered another death threat to federal agents, saying she would also kill Texas Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=168.0s)]
*  She reportedly told agents she did not intend to go to Washington, D.C. to carry out her death threat against the judge, although she did make the threat. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=178.0s)]
*  But she told them she absolutely would kill Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee when Sheila Jackson Lee came home to Texas. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=186.0s)]
*  Then it was a weird, attenuated story, sort of announcement out of Reno, Nevada on Friday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=195.0s)]
*  Hazmat teams and robots called in to respond to a cup of white powder and a threatening sign left outside the Reno, Nevada, FBI office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=201.0s)]
*  And of course, it's all the news from Fulton County, Georgia, where pro-Trump online message boards started immediately after his indictment there, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=213.0s)]
*  circulating names and purported addresses and phone numbers and photos of the grand jurors who handed down the Trump indictment in Georgia, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=221.0s)]
*  prompting the Fulton County Sheriff's Office to announce that it was investigating threats made to the grand jurors. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=230.0s)]
*  That soon gave way to the news that the FBI would be joining the Sheriff's Department investigation of those threats to the grand jurors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=236.0s)]
*  Soon gave way to news that the sheriff himself was being threatened and that that was now under investigation, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=243.0s)]
*  which soon gave news to soon gave way to news that security had also had to be increased around prosecutor Fonny Willis and her office because of threats to her. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=249.0s)]
*  Now, tonight, CNN reporting that employees of the Fulton County Sheriff's Office are themselves being threatened, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=258.0s)]
*  including their homes and their families being threatened by Trump supporters. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=265.0s)]
*  Tonight, they've announced a total lockdown on the streets around the Fulton County jail. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=269.0s)]
*  For when former President Trump turns up there this week to surrender himself and get booked, which he says will happen on Thursday. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=275.0s)]
*  But honestly, at this point, do we really expect big street protests on behalf of Trump? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=284.0s)]
*  I think we don't. I think we don't expect that. I think that dog has not barked. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=290.0s)]
*  We don't expect big street protests on his behalf. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=298.0s)]
*  We expect terrorism or at least terroristic threats like the ones that have been breaking out all over the country now like heat rash. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=303.0s)]
*  So what do we do with that as a country? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=315.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a it's a wild context in which to be pursuing politics, but we are and we must. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=317.0s)]
*  The first Republican presidential debate is day after tomorrow. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=324.0s)]
*  It's on Wednesday. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=327.0s)]
*  Trump is arguing that he is such a prohibitive favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=329.0s)]
*  He should not bother with debating. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=334.0s)]
*  And maybe that's true. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=337.0s)]
*  The NBC Des Moines Register MediaCom poll that's out today puts Trump up twenty three points over his nearest rival in the key early state of Iowa. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=339.0s)]
*  That's basically unchanged from the twenty four points. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=348.0s)]
*  He was up in Iowa in the last big poll there, which was late last month. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=350.0s)]
*  But at the same time, in that in that Iowa poll that's out today, the number of likely Republican caucus goers in Iowa who say that Trump has committed serious crimes is over twenty five percent. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=355.0s)]
*  The number of likely Republican caucus goers who say they have an unfavorable view of him is one in three. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=366.0s)]
*  Thirty three percent. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=373.0s)]
*  And when it comes to the question of whether or not Trump should be leading the Republican Party, look at this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=375.0s)]
*  Well over 50 percent of likely Republican caucus goers in Iowa say either that Trump was a good president, but it's time to consider new leaders or that the party just needs a new leader, one with better personal behavior and a different approach. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=382.0s)]
*  You put that together. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=397.0s)]
*  That's 57 percent of people who are planning on going to the Iowa Republican caucuses. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=398.0s)]
*  Fifty seven percent who say they want someone other than Trump to be leading their party. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=403.0s)]
*  Fifty seven percent don't want him leading their party while no other candidate gets within 20 percent of him in the same poll. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=409.0s)]
*  What are Republicans doing here? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=417.0s)]
*  How do you feel about this guy? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=421.0s)]
*  What do you plan on doing about it? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=423.0s)]
*  It's worth remembering that as this whole conspiracy to overturn the election results was unfolding in Georgia, there was also an absolutely critical U.S. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=425.0s)]
*  Senate race that was taking place, a runoff election that would decide which party controlled the U.S. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=439.0s)]
*  Senate in Washington. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=444.0s)]
*  In the midst of all of this, on January 5th, 2021, the day before the attack on the Capitol, Georgia Senator Ronald Reagan was elected. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=446.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Senator Warnock. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=452.0s)]
*  I should mention he is also the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in the city of Atlanta. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=454.0s)]
*  Senator Warnock, there's so much going on tonight in your home state of Georgia and in politics and all the drama around this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=459.0s)]
*  I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us about it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=465.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=469.0s)]
*  Always great to be with you, Rachel. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=471.0s)]
*  So, what's going on in the state of Georgia? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=473.0s)]
*  What do you think people should understand around the country looking in on Georgia, living through everything that you've lived through, everything that you've seen up close that's happened, knowing what you know about Fulton County and the criminal justice system and political pressures in the state? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=475.0s)]
*  What do you think people from outside Georgia should know about this pressure, about this process as the pressure just gets unbelievably high? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=487.0s)]
*  Well, Rachel, this is playing out in Georgia in Fulton County, but this is a moral moment for our nation. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=497.0s)]
*  We know who Donald Trump is. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=505.0s)]
*  The question right now is who are we? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=507.0s)]
*  What kind of country are we going to be going forward? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=509.0s)]
*  And as we watch all of this happen, we know that we're going to be going forward. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=513.0s)]
*  We are required to remain vigilant and active. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=519.0s)]
*  It's a lot like brushing and flossing. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=522.0s)]
*  There's never a moment when you can stop. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=525.0s)]
*  Otherwise, you have decay. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=528.0s)]
*  And so, while Donald Trump and the other two are going to be going forward, we're going to be going forward. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=530.0s)]
*  And so, we're going to be going forward. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=536.0s)]
*  And so, we're going to be going forward. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=538.0s)]
*  And so, we're going to be going forward. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=540.0s)]
*  And so, while Donald Trump and the other defendants may be at the center of this particular case, my eye is on the democracy itself because I believe in democracy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=542.0s)]
*  I believe that it is the political enactment of a spiritual idea, this notion that each of us has within us a spark of the divine, and therefore we ought to have a voice in the direction of the country and our destiny within it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=557.0s)]
*  And that's what's under assault. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=570.0s)]
*  And all of us as Americans, as Americans, have to stand up and fight for that, which is precious and rare in the history of humankind, democracy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=572.0s)]
*  I was struck by reading today about an event that happened this weekend in Georgia. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=582.0s)]
*  A bunch of different groups, including the Georgia NAACP and Black Voters Matter, met in Coffee County at the AME Church in Coffee County, which of course is one of the locations that has become famous because of the indictment of former President Trump and his co-defendants. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=590.0s)]
*  Coffee County is one of the places where people who were, who shouldn't have had access to voting machines and tabulating machines nevertheless were given access and all the sensitive data from those machines was uploaded onto the Internet and downloaded all over the world. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=607.0s)]
*  People met in Coffee County this weekend to talk about the damage done to their democracy in Coffee County and to try to reckon with why it's taken this long to fix it, why the police weren't involved sooner, why there hasn't necessarily been any assurance to people in that county that the next effort to vote in that county will be safe. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=622.0s)]
*  I wonder if your constituents in Georgia sort of feel this more personally, more directly, more acutely than all of us do looking at it nationally. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=642.0s)]
*  All my constituents who I'm so very proud to represent feel it. I have to tell you, I feel it personally. My mother is from that part of the state. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=652.0s)]
*  I know a lot about Coffee County and my mother was born and raised in Ware County, Waycross, Georgia nearby. And as you pointed out in your opening discussion, the people of Georgia did an amazing thing on January 5th, 2021. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=661.0s)]
*  They elected their first black United States senator and my mom, who was from Ware County, that part of the state, who grew up picking somebody else's tobacco and picking somebody else's cotton, picked her youngest son to be a United States senator. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=680.0s)]
*  That's what's at stake here. The ability of ordinary people to have a voice in their democracy, and that was assaulted by the former president and those who are enabling him in so many ways, he deserves to have his day in court. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=696.0s)]
*  He claims his innocence and he's innocent until proven guilty, so that due process ought to carry itself out. While at the same time, what we've got to do is focus on the ways in which the actions of January 6th, this unprecedented attack on our Capitol, the most violent since the War of 1812, then metastasized into a cancer of voter suppression laws all across our country. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=715.0s)]
*  Over 300 voter suppression laws were introduced in about 45 states just this year, and about 13 of them have passed. And so it is the big lie that is driving this. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=741.0s)]
*  So regardless of the outcome of the former president's case, we've got a problem and we've got to deal with it, which is why we need to pass the legislation that I and others have put forward on voting rights. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=756.0s)]
*  We've got to preserve our democracy. We've got to uphold once again that great American covenant, one person, one vote. Nothing could be more important because the democracy is the whole game. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=770.0s)]
*  It is the framework in which we get to fight for everything that matters. And long after this case is over and the books have been closed here, we'll have to face one another. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=783.0s)]
*  And our children are going to ask us, what did you do when the democracy itself was imperiled? And I want to be able to look my kids in the eye and say that I stood up for the best in the American ideal, that I stood up for the best in the covenant that we have with one another. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=792.0s)]
*  Sarah Huckabee Sanders has been governor of Arkansas for a little more than seven months, which is not that long. But boy, she hit the ground running. If you think the big problem with America is that we have child labor laws. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=814.0s)]
*  Well, she's taken care of that. Governor Huckabee Sanders immediately got to work as a new governor, getting rid of those, making it easier to put Arkansas children to work doing adult jobs. Kids younger than 16 used to need a state permit to verify their age and grant them permission to work. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=828.0s)]
*  The governor now says that permit put an arbitrary burden on parents. So that burden is lifted. Let's get your 14 year old to work. Also, Governor Huckabee Sanders rolled out an interesting online application for anybody who wanted to be on an Arkansas state board or commission.

*  The application to be on a state board or commission included this prompt for a 500 word essay quote, What is an accomplishment of the governor's that you admire the most? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=864.0s)]
*  That's a requirement to be on a official state commission of any kind in Arkansas. You have to put together 500 words on what you love about the governor. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=876.0s)]
*  Governor's office blamed a design error for that essay prompt. The governor also got right to work kicking thousands of people off their health insurance in Arkansas. More than a quarter of the people who were kicked off their health insurance were dropped off of it for procedural reasons, meaning they didn't get their paperwork in time. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=887.0s)]
*  It means that thousands of families, thousands of kids, all of whom had health insurance before, are now kicked off so they now don't have health insurance. That said, maybe the kids can get insurance at their new slaughterhouse jobs. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=906.0s)]
*  As for the school part of being a kid in Arkansas, high schoolers in that state are now starting to feel the effect of a bill that Governor Huckabee Sanders signed this year, which among other things, bars Arkansas teachers from teaching about race and racism. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=922.0s)]
*  This law went into effect August 1st. Just days later, the Arkansas Department of Education announced that the AP African American Studies course will no longer count toward graduation credits in Arkansas this year because it might amount to indoctrination. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=939.0s)]
*  Now I should tell you that of the six Arkansas high schools that had planned to offer AP African American Studies, all six of the schools have decided to offer the course anyway, even though the state says it won't count. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=954.0s)]
*  One of those schools that is defying the governor, defying the state on this is Little Rock Central High, which is going ahead with AP African American Studies and never mind the objections, but it's going to be a little rock. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=968.0s)]
*  Central High is of course the exact same school where nine brave black students attended class for the first time in 1957. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=981.0s)]
*  This is a time when the country was supposed to have desegregated our schools, but boy, they had not in Little Rock. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=990.0s)]
*  And those kids had to be escorted to class shielded from an angry, violent mob by members of the Army, National Army and the National Guard. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=996.0s)]
*  Those nine kids, the Little Rock Nine hold a signal place in African American history, in American history, but particularly in African American history, which will be taught this year at the advanced placement level at their high school.

*  We often say history rhymes. We say history repeats, but sometimes history is just a linear direct rerun. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3-ItxCCdWw&t=1018.0s)]
