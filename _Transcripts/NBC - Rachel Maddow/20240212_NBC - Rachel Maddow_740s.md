# Putin signals next targets after Ukraine for Russian expansion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw)
*  Thursday night, a new interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin with a former Fox [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=0.0s)]
*  News host was posted online. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=5.2s)]
*  You might have read that it started with Putin giving a long, inexplicable and boring history [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=8.44s)]
*  lecture that went on and on and on and on and didn't seem to have a point, and that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=12.66s)]
*  definitely lost most of its American audience. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=16.16s)]
*  True, all true. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=18.88s)]
*  Except for the part of the history lecture where Putin got to 1939, at which point he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=21.92s)]
*  then claimed in this interview that it was Poland who started World War II. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=28.24s)]
*  Poland did it, because even though Poland had cooperated with Hitler up to a point, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=33.28s)]
*  they stopped cooperating with Hitler when Hitler really wanted them to cooperate more, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=37.84s)]
*  and once that happened, Hitler had no choice, he just had to invade, and by the way, it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=42.78s)]
*  was kind of doing Poland a favor. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=46.8s)]
*  Exact same line. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  We haven't had someone trying to sell this line to an American audience since it happened [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  the first time in 1939, right, with Philip Johnson's quote-unquote reporting, right, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=57.04s)]
*  when with him we had a committed American fascist allied with the Nazis, openly rooting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=64.8s)]
*  for them, trying to sell us this bill of goods. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  That happened in 1939. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=71.24s)]
*  It hasn't happened since until now, and the reason Putin is trying to sell us the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=72.24s)]
*  American public this bizarre line now is more worrying than it is interesting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=77.72s)]
*  It might be boring, but it is worrying. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=87.36s)]
*  Here's Russian journalist Masha Gessen explaining it for an American audience in The New Yorker, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=91.16s)]
*  in a piece that I really highly recommend that you take a look at if you can in The [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=96.92s)]
*  New Yorker. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=100.48s)]
*  Gessen says this, quote, I can't get one passage out of my mind. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=101.8s)]
*  In the history lecture portion of the interview when Putin got to 1939, he said, Poland cooperated [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=106.14s)]
*  with Germany, but then it refused to comply with Hitler's demands. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  The Russians forced him, they overplayed their hand, and they forced Hitler to start [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=115.08s)]
*  the Second World War by attacking Poland. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=119.12s)]
*  The idea, Gessen says, that the, the idea that the victim of the attack serves as its [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=121.92s)]
*  instigator by forcing the hand of the aggressor, that is central to all of Putin's explanations [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=127.36s)]
*  for Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=133.32s)]
*  Gessen says, though, to my knowledge, this is the first time Putin described Hitler's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=135.16s)]
*  aggression in these same terms. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=139.42s)]
*  Quote, the way Putin described the beginning of the Second World War in this interview [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=142.16s)]
*  suggests that in his mind, he might see himself as Hitler, but perhaps a whileier one, one [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=145.56s)]
*  who can make inroads into the United States and create an alliance with its presumed future [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=151.84s)]
*  president. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  It's telling, too, Gessen continues, that Putin took the time to accuse Poland of both [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  allying with Nazi Germany and inciting Hitler's aggression. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=163.22s)]
*  As he has done with Ukraine in the past, he's positioning Poland as the heir to Nazism. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=167.74s)]
*  Putin mentioned Poland more than 30 times in this conversation with Mr. Carlson. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=173.46s)]
*  If I were Poland, I'd be scared. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=178.62s)]
*  End quote. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=183.02s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is selling a new line to Americans. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=184.34s)]
*  He's saying that Poland is the real aggressor that we should blame for World War II. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=190.66s)]
*  And he's starting to use the same language, starting to cite the same weird reasons he [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=197.7s)]
*  used to justify invading Ukraine when he talks about Poland. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=201.3s)]
*  And what's really, really important to understand about that is that Poland is a NATO country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=207.06s)]
*  They have been for 25 years now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=211.3s)]
*  And we're a NATO country, too. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=213.78s)]
*  And if Putin decides that he doesn't just want to invade Ukraine, which he's done twice [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=215.78s)]
*  now since 2014, and he doesn't just want to invade Georgia and Moldova as well, which [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=221.54s)]
*  he has also invaded, if he decides, as he is sort of threatening here, if he decides [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=226.26s)]
*  that he's going to start shooting at Poland now, too, or trying to take land in Poland, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=230.66s)]
*  that would be Putin and Russia attacking NATO, which would oblige the other 30 NATO countries [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=234.72s)]
*  in the world, including us, to come to their rescue against Russia. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=242.3s)]
*  Or maybe not. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=249.34s)]
*  Less than 48 hours after that interview posted online, former President Donald Trump, at [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=251.94s)]
*  a rally, said if he's president again, basically, he would not honor that commitment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=258.06s)]
*  He appears to have made up a conversation with what he called the leader of a, quote, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=262.98s)]
*  large NATO country, in which he says he told this leader that if that country were attacked [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=267.06s)]
*  by Russia, quote, no, I would not protect you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=271.56s)]
*  He said, quote, in fact, I would encourage them, meaning Russia, to do whatever the hell [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=274.64s)]
*  they want. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=279.68s)]
*  As David Sanger wrote in the New York Times today, quote, the larger implication of his [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  statement is that he, Trump, might invite President Vladimir Putin of Russia to pick [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=286.4s)]
*  off a NATO nation as a warning and a lesson to the 30 or so others in NATO about heeding [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=291.32s)]
*  Mr. Trump's demands. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=298.4s)]
*  I have to stress here that Trump really did use the word encourage. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=300.08s)]
*  He did not say that the United States would sit idly by in case Russia invaded a NATO [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  ally. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=311.76s)]
*  He said he would encourage Russia to go after one of our allies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=312.76s)]
*  He would encourage them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  In other words, he would tell Russia to go take out one of our allies with the assurance [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=319.52s)]
*  that we'd do nothing to help. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  This is happening within 48 hours of Putin telling a handpicked interviewer which countries [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=325.28s)]
*  he thinks really have had it coming. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=330.02s)]
*  And he's got one of them in NATO at the top of his list. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  But don't forget, President Biden is three years older than that guy, so obviously there's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  equally enormous risk in picking either of these candidates to be president of the United [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  States. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  One is obviously old. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  One is also old. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=349.11999999999995s)]
*  Biden facing 91 felony charges and saying he will literally encourage Russia to expand [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=351.2s)]
*  its war to hit our allies, while Russia's dictator is signaling to an American audience [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=355.84s)]
*  that he plans to do just that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=361.0s)]
*  Lots of other countries, I'm sad to say it, but lots of other countries have to deal with [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=367.52s)]
*  former presidents and prime ministers facing criminal charges. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=371.88s)]
*  It is awful and complicated and fraught, and nobody in this country wishes that we had [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  to deal with that, but now we do. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  That said, take comfort in the fact that lots of other countries have had to deal with that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  one way or another. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=386.8s)]
*  Maybe we can learn something from the lessons of how they've done it well or poorly. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=387.8s)]
*  Lots of other countries have had to deal with criminal charges against leaders and would-be [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=392.12s)]
*  return leaders, but nobody is dealing with a would-be return president telling a dictator [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  who's just invaded one of our allies to please go on and invade another. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  Pick one, go on, do it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=406.48s)]
*  For that one, that's us alone. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=410.14s)]
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=412.62s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul was recently in Lithuania, where he had the opportunity to speak with [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=415.82s)]
*  some of that country's leaders. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  It has a little bit of insight into how this may be playing in our allies who are very [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=420.14s)]
*  much at the pointy end of the spear here in discussions like this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=424.62s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul, it's great to see you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=429.94s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=430.94s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=432.78s)]
*  Let me first ask you if you feel like any of the reaction to what President Trump said [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=435.04s)]
*  this weekend, the interpretation of what it means, its implications, if you feel like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=440.6s)]
*  any of it's being misconstrued, or you feel like people are getting it the wrong way around, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=446.12s)]
*  or do you feel like this is getting the right kind of response? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=450.48s)]
*  I'm shocked by how muted the response is. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=454.56s)]
*  Just, you said it several times tonight, Rachel. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=457.32000000000005s)]
*  It is just completely shocking what he said. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=460.44s)]
*  And the fact that we're not all, thank you, by the way, for devoting so much time in your [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=465.32s)]
*  program tonight on it, and thank you for making the connections to the 1930s, because this [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=469.52s)]
*  is a 1930s vibe. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=476.14s)]
*  And when I was in Lithuania meeting with leaders, not just from Lithuania, but Poland, Latvia, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=478.4s)]
*  Estonia, that's the metaphor they're using and talking about these terms. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=483.56s)]
*  What's shocking to me is that we're not all not shocked by it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=487.72s)]
*  We've become so used to Mr. Trump saying these outrageous things, and then it's just, oh, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=490.8s)]
*  that's just Trump being Trump. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=496.24s)]
*  But the fact that he said Russia, Putin should invade one of our allies and he would encourage [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=498.12s)]
*  it, it's just outrageous, extraordinary. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=504.6s)]
*  So that's the reaction that I think is strange to me, that there's not more people saying [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  especially national security officials, former officials in the Republican Party, because [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=513.4000000000001s)]
*  I know that they agree with me and I'm shocked that they're so silent tonight. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=519.84s)]
*  In Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, in Poland, in those countries, is there a sense that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=525.96s)]
*  this is more than just uncouth, that this is something that there's a real threat here [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=532.96s)]
*  that Putin is actually sort of testing whether or not he can cross yet another border, that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=539.44s)]
*  he can start military action against yet another country? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=546.28s)]
*  Without question. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=552.24s)]
*  Publicly, leaders from those countries have said it, behind closed doors, they say it [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=553.24s)]
*  with even more emotion in their voice. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=558.36s)]
*  And here's the scenario they worry about. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=561.64s)]
*  Right now, Russia is stuck fighting a difficult, stalemated war in Ukraine. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=564.0s)]
*  Thank goodness that they haven't achieved greater objectives and we need to help them, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=569.84s)]
*  the Ukrainians, so that they don't. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=574.96s)]
*  But they worry what happens two years from now, three years from now, four years from [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=576.84s)]
*  now, when Russia has greater capability and we, because Mr. Trump comes to power, are [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=581.12s)]
*  no longer interested in defending our NATO allies. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=588.04s)]
*  And they talk very openly about what will we have to do if the United States is not [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  there to help us. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=596.88s)]
*  They talk very openly about how the Soviet Union was weak in 1941 when Hitler invaded, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=598.12s)]
*  but came back roaring in 1943, 44, 45. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=604.92s)]
*  And they talk very explicitly about will the United States recognize the Article 5 commitment [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=609.2399999999999s)]
*  that we have in NATO to defend them? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=615.4s)]
*  And if we don't, which coalition of countries will have to do it on their own? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=618.04s)]
*  Now, I hope they're wrong and I think it's important to understand and underscore that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  so far Russia and the Soviet Union has never attacked a NATO country. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=626.76s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  But the fact that they're having these conversations is deeply troubling, exacerbated then by what [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=632.92s)]
*  Mr. Trump just said a few days ago. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=638.92s)]
*  I mean, some of the response has been sort of leavened on the Republican side. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=643.48s)]
*  And I'm thinking principally here about Senator Marco Rubio, but also some other Republicans [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=648.36s)]
*  who have said, hey, listen, you know, we passed a law that says the Senate has to give permission [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=654.2s)]
*  if a president ever wants to get us out of NATO in the future. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=659.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, this is, like you said, Trump just being Trump, this isn't a real risk. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=664.12s)]
*  I feel like that may be true on paper, but the risk is that the green light is given [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=668.6s)]
*  once an American commitment is questioned on American soil by a would-be American leader, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=677.48s)]
*  that legally it doesn't necessarily matter that the green light has been given, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=684.44s)]
*  that the signal has been given, that the security umbrella has been removed, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=688.12s)]
*  regardless of legalistically whatever happens as a consequence of Trump's remarks. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=692.52s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right, Rachel, which is to say, yeah, the law is there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=698.76s)]
*  We're not going to withdraw from NATO. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  But if a NATO country is attacked, especially if it's an ambiguous attack, right, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=704.76s)]
*  not tanks rolling to Tallinn, but something strange, and then Trump says, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=709.32s)]
*  I don't care because they didn't pay us, that's when NATO begins to crumble [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=713.16s)]
*  with or without that law in place. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e_a8HjAdGw&t=717.96s)]
