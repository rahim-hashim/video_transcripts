# Voting Rights Faces 'Existential' Threat In New Supreme Court Term
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw)
*  One of the things that I'm scared about is that one of the things we tell each other about how to make change is to vote. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm very worried about the Voting Rights Act and what they're going to be hearing tomorrow. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=8.0s)]
*  What are your expectations in terms of the dilution of voting rights for minorities and the other threats to voting rights with this court this year? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's existential. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=20.0s)]
*  And I think what you said initially is exactly correct, which is this is not the beginning of a process. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=22.0s)]
*  This is a process that began with Shelby County. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=27.0s)]
*  It began with Citizens United. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=29.0s)]
*  It began with Bernovich two years ago when Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was circumscribed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=31.0s)]
*  So this is really what's left of a Voting Rights Act that has been eviscerated by this court. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=37.0s)]
*  And I think if they do what I suspect they're going to do tomorrow and we hear about it in the spring, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=43.0s)]
*  it's going to be almost impossible to effectuate the rights that were protected, as you said, under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=49.0s)]
*  which was the crown jewel of how we were going to get to fair voting. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=56.0s)]
*  And so I think that if you put that in tandem with the more case that you were talking about, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=61.0s)]
*  the independent state legislature case, what you are really looking at is an attempt to do in black robes [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=67.0s)]
*  what Donald Trump and John Eastman tried to do in the 2020 election, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=74.0s)]
*  which is say we are going to give state legislatures almost unfettered power to do what they will with elections, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=79.0s)]
*  to do what they will with gerrymandering, to do what they will with vote suppression, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=87.0s)]
*  up to and including election denialism, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=91.0s)]
*  That is the Harper case. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=94.0s)]
*  And I think once you're there and it's unreviewable, if it turns out that it's unreviewable by state courts under state constitutions, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=97.0s)]
*  you are essentially green lighting the thing that didn't happen in 2020 just because it was too soon. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=104.0s)]
*  If the court, in terms of court legitimacy, which is a term that I think is thrown around a lot without people understanding what it means, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=111.0s)]
*  if court legitimacy continues to be in flux the way it is now, it feels like it's in freefall actually more than in flux, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=121.0s)]
*  do you think the justices themselves end up starting to worry about people following their orders and people start following their rulings? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=129.0s)]
*  Do you think they're conscious of that as a threat? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=136.0s)]
*  Rachel, a year ago I would have said yes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=138.0s)]
*  A year ago I would have said SB8, the shadow docket, all of the ethics stuff that we saw around Clarence Thomas's wife [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=140.0s)]
*  being involved at least tangentially in January 6 and him failing to recuse himself for a case squarely about January 6, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=148.0s)]
*  at any point in that process up to and including the Dodds League, I would have said this is a court that is in trouble, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=156.0s)]
*  the wheels are coming off, they understand there's no plan B for the rule of law, once it's gone, it's gone for decades. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=162.0s)]
*  I no longer have any confidence that that's bothering them and I would go so far as to say I think when Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=169.0s)]
*  are scolding us for having conversations about legitimacy rather than asking themselves what they could have done differently, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=177.0s)]
*  I think it's just evidence to me, A, of gaslighting, but B, evidence that they don't care. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=184.0s)]
*  Dahlia Lithwick is the author of Lady Justice, Women, the Law and the Battle to Save America, and you know, by nature a very cheery person. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=190.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=199.0s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=201.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTS_zIdHw&t=214.0s)]
