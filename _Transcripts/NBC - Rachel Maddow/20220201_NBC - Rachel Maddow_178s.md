# No Wonder Trump Is Nervous: NY Attorney General Looking At Trump Bid For D.C. Hotel
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA)
*  This weekend, former President Trump lashed out at prosecutors who appeared to have him [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=0.0s)]
*  in their sights in multiple ongoing criminal and civil investigations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=4.0s)]
*  He told his supporters that he wants them in the streets in D.C. and in Georgia, in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  New York, if these prosecutors act against Trump. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=13.16s)]
*  Well, today we have some new reporting from The Washington Post that provides another [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=16.12s)]
*  window into why an investigation like the one being carried out by the New York attorney [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=19.52s)]
*  general, Letitia James, might be so concerning to the former president that he's calling [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=23.88s)]
*  for people to take to the streets in case the investigators act. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=28.62s)]
*  The Post reports that the New York AG's investigation has subpoenaed records about the Trump hotel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=32.5s)]
*  in D.C. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=38.54s)]
*  That's a property that the Trump Organization leases from the federal government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=40.34s)]
*  It's a federally owned property. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=44.42s)]
*  Letitia James's investigation is reportedly looking into whether Trump got the lease on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=46.5s)]
*  that property through fraud, whether the Trump Organization lied about its assets in order [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=50.38s)]
*  to obtain the lease for the property and the loans they used to pay for it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=55.84s)]
*  We know from documents that were filed by Attorney General James last month that it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=61.24s)]
*  was Trump's adult daughter, Ivanka Trump, who, according to the attorney general, negotiated [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=65.36s)]
*  the lease for that hotel with the federal government and negotiated a loan from Deutsche [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=70.4s)]
*  Bank to pay for it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=74.88s)]
*  Just James is arguing that the means by which the Trump Organization described their own [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=77.64s)]
*  financial condition in order to get the lease and the loan were both fraudulent. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=81.96s)]
*  Here's one example. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  As part of their statement of their assets to try to get the lease and the loan, the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  Trumps listed the value of apartments that they owned, including one that Ivanka was [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=92.28s)]
*  renting personally at the time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=96.08s)]
*  Under her rental agreement, she apparently had the option to buy that apartment if she [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  wanted to for the cost of eight and a half million dollars. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  But in the forms that were submitted to get the loan for the D.C. hotel, that very same [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=106.44s)]
*  apartment was listed as being worth more than 20 million dollars. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=111.46s)]
*  Then a few years later, they listed it as being worth 25 million dollars, even though [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=115.66s)]
*  they knew there was an option to buy it for just eight and a half. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=120.13999999999999s)]
*  Attorney General James is looking into exactly that type of potentially illegal inflation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  of the Trump family and Trump Organization's financial situation for a whole bunch of Trump [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  properties. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=135.98s)]
*  Thanks to the Washington Post, we now know that the attorney general's investigation [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=136.98s)]
*  has subpoenaed the federal government about Trump's deal for that property in D.C. as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  well. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=144.22s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, if I were the former president, I don't know that I'd be calling for my supporters [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=145.22s)]
*  to riot if I was indicted in this investigation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  But I might be concerned. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QADRNPB7JtA&t=155.26000000000002s)]
