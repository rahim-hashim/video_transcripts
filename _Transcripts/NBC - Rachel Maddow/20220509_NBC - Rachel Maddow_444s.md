# As Putin Shows Weakness, U.S. Steps Up Aid To Ukraine In Sign Of Recalibrated U.S. Role
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o)
*  Joining us now is David Remnick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=0.0s)]
*  He is editor of The New Yorker. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=2.2s)]
*  He's also a former Moscow correspondent for The Washington Post. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  He won a Pulitzer Prize for a book he wrote based on his time there, which is called Lenin's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=6.08s)]
*  Tomb, The Last Days of the Soviet Empire. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=10.58s)]
*  Mr. Remnick, it's a real pleasure to have you here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=13.32s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=15.56s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=16.56s)]
*  I'm asking those questions in that introduction tonight because I honestly don't know what [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=17.56s)]
*  the answer to them is, but I feel like our assumptions are getting a little wobbly. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=22.72s)]
*  Our expectations about Putin's behavior, not just toward Ukraine but toward us, are starting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=28.8s)]
*  to be mismatched with what we're seeing from him in reality. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Do you think that's fair? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=37.32s)]
*  I think it's very fair. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=38.32s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=39.32s)]
*  I woke up deliberately at 4.30 in the morning hoping to read in real time or watch Putin's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=40.56s)]
*  speech on Red Square. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=49.0s)]
*  As you pointed out in your really excellent summation of what happened today and what's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=50.6s)]
*  May 9th is always a big deal because it is the great national unifying narrative, the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=55.72s)]
*  victory in what's called the Great Patriotic War. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=64.16s)]
*  As important as it is here, it's in many ways much more important in Soviet history and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=67.6s)]
*  even in the post-Soviet space. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  He said nothing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=76.32s)]
*  You have it exactly right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=77.5s)]
*  I read immediately in Russian and then in English thinking, you know, my Russian is [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=79.36s)]
*  I read it on the Kremlin website and I kept waiting for the payoff pitch and it never [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=84.2s)]
*  came. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=89.32s)]
*  It never came. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=90.32s)]
*  What you found there was just the resuscitation, the repetition of what I would call a salvation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=92.6s)]
*  narrative. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=99.32s)]
*  You can't possibly say in real terms why he invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=100.32s)]
*  Invaded Ukraine because he wants to battle with the West after long years of resentment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=106.44s)]
*  He invaded Ukraine because it was growing fitfully, more and more democratic, more and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=112.52s)]
*  more away from Russia and more and more away from his conception of some form of modern [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  imperial Russia. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=126.32s)]
*  So he needs a vocabulary for that to relate to the Russian people and it's not there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  And so that's where the invention of Nazis comes from. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=135.0s)]
*  Yes, there are people on that are there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  There are some people who are on the far right, nationalists in Ukraine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=140.83999999999997s)]
*  But to call this a national trend or to not fail to see or to fail to see that that nationalism [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=144.64s)]
*  comes from somewhere is to know nothing about Ukrainian history or the idea that Putin has [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=151.72s)]
*  a problem with far right nationalism. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=157.04s)]
*  I mean, given Russia, all over the place in Russia, including in his own in his own house. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=158.88s)]
*  And he's losing it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=166.92s)]
*  He's losing it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I thought I was full of news here coming, having read a Russian website [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  all about Lenta.ru and all those amazing things that went up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=173.76s)]
*  And you obviously you had it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's a terrific thing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=181.0s)]
*  It made me think of a different time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=182.48s)]
*  In 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to put down what was called the Prague Spring. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=186.6s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=196.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=197.04s)]
*  In Soviet terms, seven or eight very brave people, including somebody pushing a baby [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=198.04s)]
*  carriage came to Red Square and took out banners and said, Czechoslovakia, we are with you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  We're against this invasion. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=213.12s)]
*  Within a minute, within a minute, predictably, KGB officers are obviously guarding Red Square [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=215.28s)]
*  and the Kremlin were on these people, beat the hell out of them. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=221.2s)]
*  All those people were arrested and most went off to prison camps. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=223.88s)]
*  Pavel Litvinov, somebody I wrote about Lenin's tomb many, many years ago. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=227.6s)]
*  That was a one minute long, almost invisible protest. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=232.0s)]
*  And it had immense repercussions with the years the dissident movement was inspired [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=238.54s)]
*  by it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=242.56s)]
*  Sakharov was inspired by it, you know, became more and more overtly Andrei Sakharov, leader [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=243.56s)]
*  of a dissident movement. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=249.1s)]
*  It's hard to know what instances like this, like this demonstration on Lent-a-Roo of incredible [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=251.08s)]
*  bravery or that woman who some weeks ago ran behind the TV presenter and also during the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=258.12s)]
*  nightly news. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=266.86s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=267.86s)]
*  Yes, incredible. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=268.86s)]
*  And I think it is the presumption is that everybody is for this war because everybody [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=269.98s)]
*  listens to propaganda television. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=275.32s)]
*  And that's that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=277.2s)]
*  I think as time goes by, because people are not stupid, because mothers are receiving [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  phone calls from their sons at the front, because casualties are building up and the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=285.76s)]
*  economic repercussions are making themselves known, that the ability to keep all this information [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=293.36s)]
*  out of the public consciousness will recede. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=301.48s)]
*  And his problems will not only be just military, his problems will not only be just his confrontations [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=305.4s)]
*  with the West, but I think it is entirely possible that as his fury grows, so too will [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=310.88s)]
*  his problems. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=318.52s)]
*  Which should change our expectations in terms of what he believes he can ask the Russian [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=320.12s)]
*  people for or he can tell the Russian people they're about to deliver. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=325.73999999999995s)]
*  What we were waiting for this morning was a big mobilization of something. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=328.88s)]
*  So people that were reservists, kids from all over the country or young men from all [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=332.88s)]
*  over the country, first of all that would have enormous economic repercussions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=338.02s)]
*  It would heighten alarm among the general population about what's at stake in Ukraine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=342.56s)]
*  Why is this taking so long? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=348.04s)]
*  What is this special military operation? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=350.28s)]
*  It seems a lot more serious than that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=353.04s)]
*  And the nonsense begins to corrode. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=355.6s)]
*  One of the information things that happened this week is an awful guy on Russian television [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=360.36s)]
*  named Vladimir Solovyov. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=366.0s)]
*  And he runs some spectacular propaganda television shows. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=368.36s)]
*  He was sent to Mariupol to kind of lead the propaganda. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=373.34s)]
*  Imagine Tucker Carlson being sent to, I don't know, Charlottesville to whip up the fervor [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=379.88s)]
*  in a kind of civil war. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=385.96s)]
*  That's the move. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=388.56s)]
*  That's the move. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=389.88s)]
*  And it doesn't really work. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=390.88s)]
*  It doesn't really work. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=394.04s)]
*  He was supposed to inspire the people of Mariupol to get excited about Russia invading them? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=395.04s)]
*  Well, and also to be filmed and shown to the folks back there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  That we're liberators. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=404.0s)]
*  This understanding about how this, what the room in which Putin feels he can maneuver, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=406.18s)]
*  even if he is, as you say, losing it, I think is going to change the American calibration [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=411.96s)]
*  in terms of how much we can maneuver and how he may respond. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=416.72s)]
*  And I feel like we are only starting to figure it out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr385od8g4o&t=420.64s)]
