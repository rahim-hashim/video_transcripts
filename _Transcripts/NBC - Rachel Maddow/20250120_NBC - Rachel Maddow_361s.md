# Authoritarianism 101: Maddow explains how Trump's embrace of violence follows a type
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs)
*  Earlier in the day, we started seeing messages fly from January 6th defendants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=0.0s)]
*  and their families claiming even before any official pardons had been signed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=5.22s)]
*  that they were getting word that their charges were being dropped or they're [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=8.72s)]
*  being processed for release from prison. This was one of the earliest messages we [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=11.92s)]
*  saw today online. This man claiming the Justice Department was dropping his [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=16.16s)]
*  pending criminal case. This is a man who had been charged with beating police [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=20.0s)]
*  officers with a baseball bat. That's him with a black bat there on the left side [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=23.72s)]
*  of your screen. That's at the Capitol building. Obviously on January 6th, there [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=27.6s)]
*  had been word, including from Vice President J. D. Vance, that nobody [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  charged with violence against police officers would be pardoned by Trump. But [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=36.24s)]
*  this man today posted online that he'd heard that his case was being dropped. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=40.28s)]
*  Tonight, within the past hour, we got word that there appears to not have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=45.56s)]
*  been a distinction made between those convicted of just participating in the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=49.74s)]
*  January 6th attack and those who participated violently in the attack, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=53.86s)]
*  including those who attacked police officers physically. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=57.66s)]
*  The list of people whose sentences were commuted by Trump today commuted to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=62.76s)]
*  time serve so they can be released released from prison includes some of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=66.26s)]
*  the people convicted of violence against police officers. It includes [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=70.14s)]
*  paramilitary leaders who were sentenced for seditious conspiracy for attempting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=73.5s)]
*  to overthrow the U. S. Government by force. You may have seen today that the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=78.86s)]
*  proud boys put on their full colors and marched today in Washington in advance [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=83.72s)]
*  of tonight's announcement, saying free our boys. Well, now their leaders and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  their members convicted of trying to overthrow the government and of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  violence against police officers. They are all being sprung out of prison. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=96.02s)]
*  1500 people altogether, either receiving pardons or commutations from Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=100.66s)]
*  tonight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=105.08s)]
*  Of all the possibilities considered about what Trump would do with the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=105.98s)]
*  people who committed violence on his behalf on January 6th, this was the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=109.26s)]
*  maximalist option, pardoning and commuting all of their sentences so that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=113.58000000000001s)]
*  all of them are released. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=121.18s)]
*  This was the maximalist option. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=123.78s)]
*  And, you know, like the blatant transactional open for business [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=127.78s)]
*  corruption, you know, founding his own currency that you can buy to put money [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  in his pocket the weekend before he becomes president. Aside from all of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=137.94s)]
*  that just blatant open for business corruption, what we're seeing here with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  the January 6 pardons, this kind of thing does have the benefit of novelty, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=145.89999999999998s)]
*  right? We've never quite seen something like this before. But like with the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=148.82s)]
*  corruption, the boring thing about it is that we know exactly what this leads to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Authoritarian rulers all over the world have always liked to have paramilitary, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=157.1s)]
*  loyal, but unofficial perpetrators of violence and menace to work on their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=162.18s)]
*  behalf, to intimidate and hurt anyone in opposition, to make it too scary for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=167.14s)]
*  normal people to participate in politics or civic life, to make everybody who [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=171.54s)]
*  might oppose Trump in any way worried about the thugs that might turn up at [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=176.38s)]
*  their door. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump pardoning and releasing from prison the January 6th, this was the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=182.7s)]
*  January 26th time he pardoned his predecessors. BaglBar Biden saying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=186.98s)]
*  that President Biden hasонь time liberal, or when he [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=191.45999999999998s)]

*  In authoritarian Hungary, Viktor Orbán's government pardoned a far-right agitator who had set [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=212.3s)]
*  fire to the homes of Orbán's political rivals. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  In Turkey, Erdogan had pardoned the leader of a far-right nationalist paramilitary group [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=221.74s)]

*  Don't even ask me about the essay in Germany. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=247.62s)]
*  Don't get me started. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=249.54s)]
*  But this is day one unfolding pretty much the way we expected it to. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=253.7s)]
*  And yes, this is novel in American history, but it is also knowable in world history because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=257.94s)]
*  it's the same stuff every other would-be authoritarian leader does in every country [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=263.90000000000003s)]

*  And as Americans, you know, we've had bad inaugurations before, including the one where [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=273.46000000000004s)]

*  We've had civil war. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=286.58s)]
*  But before, each of those things has been treated as a calamity and a scandal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=289.14s)]
*  This time, it's a platform. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=295.5s)]
*  This is textbook authoritarian takeover 101 tactics, which means today and literally over [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=299.7s)]
*  the next few days, they're going to see what they can get away with and how much they can [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  cow people into not opposing what they're doing and not speaking out about what's wrong [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=311.34s)]
*  with it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=315.53999999999996s)]

*  You're going to want to have a good answer when you get asked what you did for your country [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=322.84s)]
*  when your country started to take a turn this radical. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=326.72s)]
*  We are here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2lMQ6pysAs&t=330.76s)]
