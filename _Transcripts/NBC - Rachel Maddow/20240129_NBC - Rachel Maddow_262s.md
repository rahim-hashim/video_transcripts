# 'He is nothing': E. Jean Carroll on the biggest surprise of confronting Trump in court
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0)
*  Joining us now is E. Jean Carroll, who successfully sued Donald Trump for defamation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=0.0s)]
*  She's flanked tonight by her lawyers in the case, Robbie Kaplan, who you see on your left, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=4.76s)]
*  and Sean Crowley, who you see on the right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=8.9s)]
*  Thank you all so much for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=10.88s)]
*  It's such a pleasure to see the three of you here and to have you here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=12.92s)]
*  I'm really grateful you made the time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=16.04s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=18.04s)]
*  Jean, let me just ask you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=20.28s)]
*  You guys have lived this case in one way or another since 2019, when Trump was still in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  the White House and you published your book. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  How different is it now to be part of this case now that you are out the other side? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=29.44s)]
*  You have won this massive $83 million judgment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=34.44s)]
*  Does it feel different to you now than it did while you were in the middle of it? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=39.56s)]
*  Rachel, thank you for that incredible introduction. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  The three of us were shaking with laughter and tears in our eyes, laughing and crying [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=48.36s)]
*  all at the same time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=53.84s)]
*  You happened to put in a nutshell what we were fighting for. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=55.28s)]
*  You did it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=59.52s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=60.52s)]
*  Yes, I feel that this bodes well for the future. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=61.96s)]
*  I think we've planted our flag. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=67.48s)]
*  I think we've made a statement that things are going to be different, that there's going [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=70.4s)]
*  of doing things in this country because of this indestructible team of lawyers, Rachel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  I am sometimes 50 years older than some of the associates on our team. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=94.04s)]
*  I'm 40 years older than Sean. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm 30 years older than Robbie. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=101.84s)]
*  And together, this team of brilliant young people have, as you said, stood up to the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=105.32s)]
*  man who, by the way, Rachel, is not even there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=116.63999999999999s)]
*  He's nothing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  He is like a walrus snorting and like a rhino flopping his hand. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=126.56s)]
*  He is not there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=133.48s)]
*  That was the surprising thing to me. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  On that point, talking about being face to face with him, being in the same physical [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=139.6s)]
*  space with him for the first time since when you say he assaulted you in 1996, what you're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=144.2s)]
*  describing there in terms of him being nothing, him feeling like an animal, him feeling not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  intimidating, was that a shock to you? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Your guts here, your bravery here includes the physical bravery about being around him [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=160.88s)]
*  again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=164.68s)]
*  It sounds like it didn't go the way you expected it to once you were in the same room. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=165.68s)]
*  No, Rachel, I was terrified. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=168.84s)]
*  I was just a bag of sweating corpuscles as we prepared for trial. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=171.88s)]
*  And four days before trial, I had an actual breakdown. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=179.32s)]
*  I lost my ability to speak. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=184.08s)]
*  I lost my words. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=186.28s)]
*  I couldn't talk, and I couldn't go on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=187.44s)]
*  That's how frightened I was. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=191.4s)]
*  But oddly, we went into court. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=193.44s)]
*  Robbie took the lectern. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=197.2s)]
*  I sat in the witness chair like this, and she said, Miss Carroll, good morning. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  Would you please spell your name for the court? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=205.68s)]
*  And amazingly, I looked out, and he was nothing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=208.76s)]
*  He was nothing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=216.2s)]
*  He was a phantom. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  It was the people around him who were giving him power. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  He himself was nothing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=222.0s)]
*  It was an astonishing discovery for me. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  He's nothing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=231.48s)]
*  We don't need to be afraid of him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  He can be knocked down twice by this woman right here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=235.56s)]
*  He's nothing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=247.2s)]
*  He's nothing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYgHNHKuyx0&t=248.2s)]
