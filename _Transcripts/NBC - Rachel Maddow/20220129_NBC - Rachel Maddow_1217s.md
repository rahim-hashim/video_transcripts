# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 28
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno)
*  The January 6 investigation today subpoenaed two electors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=0.0s)]
*  in each of the seven states, the ones who were elected [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=3.4s)]
*  as chairperson and secretary to preside over the signing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=6.2s)]
*  of these fraudulent documents. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=10.68s)]
*  Now that list of 14 subpoenaed fake electors [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=12.64s)]
*  actually and surprisingly includes prominent figures. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=15.72s)]
*  It actually includes figures like the chairman [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=19.12s)]
*  of the state Republican party in the state of Georgia, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=22.12s)]
*  in the state of Nevada. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=25.16s)]
*  And it's interesting because the chairman [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=27.16s)]
*  of the January 6 investigation, Congressman Benny Thompson, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=29.04s)]
*  I said, quote, we believe the individuals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=32.16s)]
*  we have subpoenaed today have information [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  about how these so-called alternate electors met [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=37.48s)]
*  and who was behind that scheme. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=41.04s)]
*  Now we encourage them to cooperate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=43.68s)]
*  with the select committee's investigation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  to get answers about January 6 for the American people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=47.28s)]
*  and help ensure nothing like that day ever happens again. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=50.36s)]
*  And even as those subpoenas go out today, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  NBC News Tonight has confirmed news first reported by CNN [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=59.04s)]
*  that the January 6 investigation has also subpoenaed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=62.84s)]
*  Trump White House press secretary, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=66.12s)]
*  deputy press secretary, excuse me, Judd Deer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=67.64s)]
*  Now all of which, when you think about it, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=70.2s)]
*  goes to show really the scope of the January 6 investigation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=72.28s)]
*  from meetings that took place in the White House [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=76.32s)]
*  immediately around the events of January 6 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=79.8s)]
*  to these gatherings of fake electors [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=82.52s)]
*  in seven states that happened weeks earlier. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=84.92s)]
*  Lots of questions and the timeline [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=88.84s)]
*  is just being flushed out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is California congressman [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=92.96s)]
*  and member of the January 6 investigation, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Peter Aguilar. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=97.52s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much, sir, for joining us. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=98.56s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your time this evening. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=100.6s)]
*  Let me ask you about that last point that I just left on, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=102.24s)]
*  the scope of the investigation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Why subpoena these fake Trump electors? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=107.64s)]
*  How does what they were doing fit into what your investigation, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=109.88s)]
*  into the narrative that is being woven around January 6 [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=114.72s)]
*  and you trying to get to the bottom of it? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Eamon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=121.6s)]
*  I think the importance of these 14 individuals [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=122.92s)]
*  is because we want to know how deep this conversation went [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=125.96s)]
*  with individuals in and around the White House. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=130.0s)]
*  Was this something that they were directed to do [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=132.64s)]
*  by the Republican Party officials, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=134.96s)]
*  or was this something that was more coordinated? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=137.64s)]
*  Those are some of the questions that we have, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=140.83999999999997s)]
*  but I think it's deeply disturbing that not only did they meet [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=143.0s)]
*  at state capitals in these seven states [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  and sent these slates of electors to Congress, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=149.2s)]
*  but they sent them to the National Archives. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=152.64s)]
*  They wanted to create this alternate universe [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  that they purported to live in. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=160.0s)]
*  And so I think that's deeply problematic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  We need to make sure that none of this ever happens again, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=164.56s)]
*  but we're going to need to talk to those individuals. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  And as the chairman's statement said, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=169.72s)]
*  we're going to ask them to come forward and to speak with us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=171.56s)]
*  Can I just hone in for a moment on the backstory of these individuals? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Because a number of the fake electors who participated in this scheme [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  said at the time that they believed they were creating these documents [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  as kind of a backup in the event that the Trump campaign prevailed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=188.36s)]
*  in its election challenges in court. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=192.76s)]
*  Obviously, that didn't happen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=195.2s)]
*  The documents submitted from Pennsylvania and New Mexico [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=197.28s)]
*  actually were very explicit. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=199.6s)]
*  They explicitly stated that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=201.0s)]
*  Do you think those in other states may have been misled [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=202.64s)]
*  by the Trump campaign officials into believing that's what they were, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  in fact, doing with these fake electors, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=210.68s)]
*  when in fact the Trump campaign intended to use those fake elector slates [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=212.44s)]
*  to try and overturn the election in Congress? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=216.72s)]
*  I think it's altogether possible, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=219.96s)]
*  but I also think it's altogether possible [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  that they were hearing of multiple different conspiracy theories. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  And so different individuals in different states [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=228.08s)]
*  might have had different ideas of what was happening. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=230.96s)]
*  And I think that puts the importance and the finer point behind [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=233.0s)]
*  why we'd like to have continued conversations with them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  Who were they coordinating with? Who were they talking to? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  Who was giving them advice on where to send this? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  Who to recruit to help them? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=245.24s)]
*  Those are the important pieces that we want to get to the bottom of. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  And we've pledged to our colleagues and to the American public [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=251.48s)]
*  that we're going to turn over every stone [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=254.64s)]
*  and make sure that we seek the truth. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  And so this is the natural next step of where we need to go. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=258.0s)]
*  Let me, if I can, Congressman, just drill down for a moment [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  on the timeline, in particular on January 5th. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=264.6s)]
*  Can you confirm the NBC News reporting tonight [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=266.88s)]
*  that the committee has also subpoenaed Trump, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=269.84s)]
*  White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deer? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  And if I can, a second part to that, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=274.64s)]
*  is it the case that you are particularly interested [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=276.52s)]
*  in an Oval Office staff meeting on January 5th? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=280.08s)]
*  The importance, if you will, of that meeting? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, we have issued a subpoena to that individual, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  the former White House aide. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=292.4s)]
*  And I think it's because he was a part of three conversations [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=294.32s)]
*  and continuing threads that we'd like to have more conversations about. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  One was, you know, he continued to fan the flame [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  that the election was rigged, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=306.88s)]
*  leading up to January 5th and January 6th. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  That January 5th, we have reason to believe he was in the Oval Office [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=313.08s)]
*  during that discussion. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=316.76s)]
*  And on January 6th, we also feel that he played a role [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=318.12s)]
*  in coordinating the White House response to that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=322.88s)]
*  as the insurrection was going on. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=327.2s)]
*  So those are some of the conversations that we seek to have. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=329.64s)]
*  With that individual, and he has received a letter from the chairman. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=333.64s)]
*  Has he responded to you or not yet? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not aware of a response to date, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=341.36s)]
*  but I think this was happening in real time today. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=343.08s)]
*  The second largest natural harbor in the world is in Ireland. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=347.44s)]
*  It's actually in County Cork. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=352.2s)]
*  It is fittingly named Cork Harbor. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=354.04s)]
*  And last spring, actually, something odd happened there, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=357.72s)]
*  and you can see it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=360.44s)]
*  There was a flotilla of fishing boats, about 50 of them, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=361.48s)]
*  that actually went cruising down Cork Harbor in a single file line. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=366.36s)]
*  This was a protest that was organized by a group of Irish fishermen [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=371.16s)]
*  who were upset, rightfully so, that their access to their old fishing grounds [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  were being cut as a result of Brexit and everything that was as a result of that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=378.92s)]
*  Now, given these particular fishermen's history of political activism, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=383.8s)]
*  it really shouldn't have been less of a surprise [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=387.72s)]
*  when that same group announced their newest plans just this week. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=390.52s)]
*  They said they were going to protest Russia's military exercises [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=395.08s)]
*  planned off the Irish coast next week, right in the way of where these [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  fishermen usually do their jobs, where they earn their livelihoods. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=402.52s)]
*  The fishermen said they plan to deploy a flotilla of 60 trawlers in protest [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  right along where Russia is planning those live fire war games. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=411.68s)]
*  In response, the Russian government said any kind of protest [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=416.44s)]
*  by those fishermen would be reckless and even dangerous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=419.28s)]
*  And today, the Russian embassy, again, made it clear that they expect [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=424.0s)]
*  those fishermen to stay very far away from their military exercises. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  The embassy said today in part, quote, The ambassador urged the fishermen [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  to refrain from any provocative actions, which might endanger all involved. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  Russia's war games are set to start off the Irish coast on Thursday. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=443.84s)]
*  The fishermen said they plan to hit the waters starting Tuesday. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=447.8s)]
*  Is the plan still on? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=452.2s)]
*  Joining me now is Patrick Murphy. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=454.36s)]
*  He is the CEO of the Irish South and West Fish [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  Producers Organization, the group that we were telling you about [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  planning this protest against the Russian Navy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=462.32s)]
*  He met with the Russian ambassador yesterday. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=465.16s)]
*  Mr. Murphy, it is great to have you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=467.68s)]
*  And I know how late it is in Ireland. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  So thank you so much for being here with us. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  First off, tell me what it was like meeting with the Russian ambassador yesterday. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=473.88s)]
*  What did he have to tell you about all of this? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=478.48s)]
*  And first of all, it's great to be on your show and watching all the clips coming in. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm just wondering, is it me that you're showing on the television there [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=488.36s)]
*  and how this came about? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=493.0s)]
*  So meeting an ambassador of any country like is an honor, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=494.96s)]
*  regardless of the nation that you're meeting. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=499.68s)]
*  You know, we met the English ambassador when we had trouble with Brexit [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=501.88s)]
*  and we got a two year extension from that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=506.56s)]
*  So maybe we're getting used to meeting ambassadors. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=508.84s)]
*  And we won't turn our show away from any part of the job [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  as long as we keep our boats fishing outside. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=517.56s)]
*  And that is proving more and more difficult. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  So the flotilla first and cork just we start there [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=523.16s)]
*  because maybe that leads into the story with Brexit, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=526.28s)]
*  Ireland's fishing nation lost 25 percent of our fish. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=529.7199999999999s)]
*  That's a quarter of our fish was taken from us by the European Union [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=533.88s)]
*  and gifted to the United Kingdom's in the trade deal. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=538.16s)]
*  And that has left us short the fish. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=543.2399999999999s)]
*  And we're seeing now that there could be a decimation of our fishing fleet. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=545.76s)]
*  So for an island nation with 29 percent of the water, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=551.76s)]
*  we could end up with the smallest fleet in Europe, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=554.8s)]
*  with the smallest share of fish in Europe and a dying industry. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=557.88s)]
*  So when this came about, it came about that we saw it on social media [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=562.96s)]
*  and we did a little bit of research into what was happening [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=568.72s)]
*  and we didn't like what we found. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=571.24s)]
*  So we put out the original statement to say that, you know, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=573.36s)]
*  we were going to go fishing and that if we were fishing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=576.5200000000001s)]
*  and somebody came along and said this and you have to move at that stage, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=580.0s)]
*  we were going to say, no, not going to happen. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  We're going to continue to fish. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=587.08s)]
*  And the maritime law is on our side, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=589.08s)]
*  despite what our own politicians have done to try and undermine us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=591.84s)]
*  So let's let's describe that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=596.64s)]
*  If you're driving down on the motorway, right, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=598.6s)]
*  and somebody comes in off a side road and drives into the side of you, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  he's the one that caused the collision. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=605.64s)]
*  And it's no different than marine law. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  If you're outside towing in it and somebody comes in from the side [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=609.96s)]
*  who's not towing net, he's just steaming and hits you. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=613.84s)]
*  And it's he's the one that's caused the collision. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=616.68s)]
*  It's not you. You're you're doing your business. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=618.68s)]
*  So for anybody to say that the fishing boat is the one causing the danger, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=621.0s)]
*  who would be out there days before the other events are to start in our waters. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  Can it be correct as far as we're concerned? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=629.64s)]
*  And this is an area where we get fish. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=632.3599999999999s)]
*  It's very complicated. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  You can see behind me up here. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=637.76s)]
*  Yeah, the the area in question. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's a very lucrative place for a fish called nephrop's prawns [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  or Dublin Bay prawns or langoustines. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=648.88s)]
*  And they're so important that in Spain, when somebody's getting married [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=651.48s)]
*  to show how good you are or how well off you are, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=655.72s)]
*  it counts by the amount of prawns that you put on the guest's dinner place. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=659.04s)]
*  That's what has been reported back to us. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=663.68s)]
*  So that will tell you how lucrative they are. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  And we, as I said, very strict laws. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=668.36s)]
*  So our fishing starts from month to month and you get a certain amount [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=670.84s)]
*  of fish to catch. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=674.64s)]
*  And if you don't catch it, you can't carry it forward into the next month. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=676.0s)]
*  So you lose it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=679.64s)]
*  So if two boats go out and one catches the full quota of eight tons for the month [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  and the other catches five next month, they start off. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  Each boat could get eight again. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=689.12s)]
*  So the guy with five loses the three. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=690.76s)]
*  So you see, if you're impeded in your in your effort [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=693.24s)]
*  going out there in the first week, it can be a bust. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=696.12s)]
*  You know, you don't make any money in the first week, especially if the trip [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  takes two weeks to make money and within a week you're told to go home, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=704.08s)]
*  then you're in debt rather than profit. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  So our boats were concerned that that was the main point. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=711.32s)]
*  And the second point then is when we heard that there was going to be [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  ordnance fired into the sky. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=717.28s)]
*  Well, you know, we all know what gravity does with Mr. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=719.48s)]
*  Newton, but was of course down. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=722.88s)]
*  So we were concerned about that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=725.52s)]
*  And it's dangerous. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=727.76s)]
*  And you have to understand, David, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=728.84s)]
*  we were getting no information from our own government, nobody in the department [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=730.6s)]
*  of marine and anybody was telling us anything about this. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  We were clueless. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=737.08s)]
*  So when we put out the statements and as you've seen in one of the shows there, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=738.48s)]
*  they picked it up and it became a big story very quickly. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=743.88s)]
*  And everybody was talking about it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  And of course, the Russian embassy and the ambassador heard about it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=751.0s)]
*  And in fairness to them, I give credit where credit is due. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=756.24s)]
*  They contacted us. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=759.64s)]
*  So when they contacted us and they gave us the warning and we went back [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=760.96s)]
*  and we told them, look, we have serious concerns and we sent some correspondence [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  between the two of us. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  And within a couple of days, he invited us up to the embassy. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=771.2800000000001s)]
*  And of course, I represent my fishermen [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=774.64s)]
*  and I do the best that I can. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=779.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm a fisherman myself all my life. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=781.0400000000001s)]
*  I come from a small island community. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=782.72s)]
*  I have seen my friends, some of my friends lost to the sea. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=784.88s)]
*  So I know the dangers of it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=788.52s)]
*  I myself have had a few close calls on the water. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=790.56s)]
*  So, you know, I know the dangers of that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=794.68s)]
*  So we are not adverse to danger in our industry. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  We're not shrinking violets. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=801.12s)]
*  And it's something that's just ingrained in us. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=803.32s)]
*  So when this came about, we just said very simply, all we want to do is fish. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=807.96s)]
*  These are our fishing grounds. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=812.16s)]
*  This is where we fish and we don't see any reason [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=813.56s)]
*  why if somebody else is coming into the grounds, that we are the ones [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=816.56s)]
*  that have to make way. Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=819.5999999999999s)]
*  So that's that's that's our stance. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  And we said then that it would be our protests. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that if the Russian fleet came in and they wanted to do their exercises [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=827.2399999999999s)]
*  and we were fishing and they said, go, our protest was no, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=831.28s)]
*  just we're just going to keep fishing here. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  And you have to leave. You have to go away. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=837.28s)]
*  And that was out the main trust of our protest. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=839.76s)]
*  And our boats are actually out in that area. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=844.32s)]
*  So they're not going to go out like the flotilla that you've seen in Cork. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=847.84s)]
*  We gathered them from all over the country and again, protesting about Brexit, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=852.0400000000001s)]
*  because the plan is that all those boats that you've seen going up the river, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=856.76s)]
*  every third one, they will be eliminated and gone. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=861.4s)]
*  And these are all family businesses that have been built up [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  over generations and and it's going to be I think like [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=868.68s)]
*  I was going to say, I just wanted to jump in there real quick to say, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  because I know it is it is something that is very important to you [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=875.3199999999999s)]
*  and your family and your community. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=877.88s)]
*  It clearly now has geopolitical implications. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=879.2399999999999s)]
*  So we will be following this story very closely. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=882.88s)]
*  Patrick Murphy, the CEO of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organization. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=885.76s)]
*  We wish you and your fishermen, your community safety, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  and we'll be in touch with you over the next couple of days. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Patrick. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  Joining us now live from Moscow is Anne Simmons, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=898.8s)]
*  Moscow bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=901.4s)]
*  And thank you so much for staying up late and joining us [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=903.4s)]
*  on all of the facets of this breaking story. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=906.8399999999999s)]
*  There was one development I didn't mention there, but a significant one. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=910.0s)]
*  President Biden telling reporters earlier today [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=913.52s)]
*  that he will be moving US troops to Eastern Europe [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=917.0s)]
*  and the NATO countries in the near term. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=920.7199999999999s)]
*  I know it's still in the middle of the night there, perhaps early morning in Russia. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=922.9599999999999s)]
*  But do you think this will in any way change any of the dynamics [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=925.92s)]
*  or the calculation that we are seeing right now? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Eamon. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=935.5999999999999s)]
*  First of all, I would say that it could, in fact, provoke [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=937.28s)]
*  Mr. Putin in some way. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=940.9599999999999s)]
*  The Russians have been very clear that they don't like to be bullied. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=944.28s)]
*  Mr. Putin has made clear that Russian troops are on Russian territory [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=948.1999999999999s)]
*  and he doesn't believe that they do need to pull back. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=954.16s)]
*  In many regards, Mr. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=957.5999999999999s)]
*  Putin has won a small victory already because the world is now paying attention. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=959.2399999999999s)]
*  Everyone wants to speak to Vladimir Putin. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=964.64s)]
*  There's shuttle diplomacy. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=967.4799999999999s)]
*  Everyone wants to speak to Russia and find out what Mr. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=969.88s)]
*  Putin intends to do. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=973.8399999999999s)]
*  So it's very difficult at this particular juncture [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=975.56s)]
*  to really pin down what the Russians next move will be. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=978.68s)]
*  I'm curious whether you see it as well. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=984.68s)]
*  You know, has Putin made it costly for NATO to essentially accept [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=987.12s)]
*  not just Ukraine, but any future country in Eastern Europe [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=992.4799999999999s)]
*  where Russians can be stationed on its border? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=996.4399999999999s)]
*  Has he essentially made the cost of the future calculation of NATO, saying [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=998.5999999999999s)]
*  it's not worth this headache to constantly have to worry about [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1003.3599999999999s)]
*  which country Russia is going to have troops on its border [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1006.3599999999999s)]
*  that could suck us all into a major confrontation? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  That could very well be the case. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1013.68s)]
*  There's a certain level of instability now, insecurity, uncertainty. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1016.56s)]
*  And it's something that Mr. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1021.68s)]
*  Putin has wanted to create for Ukraine, because there's no way that NATO [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1023.68s)]
*  is going to accept a country that has any kind of conflict on its territory. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  So already there is this sense that Mr. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  Putin has won a small victory there, that there is insecurity in Ukraine [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1038.2s)]
*  just by the very presence of 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1043.32s)]
*  100,000 Russian troops. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, there's still no clear indication [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1051.1599999999999s)]
*  of whether or not those troops will all move in at once to overcome Ukraine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1054.6799999999998s)]
*  The Russians have said they do not intend to invade. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1060.6s)]
*  And there could be small incursions into the country. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1064.12s)]
*  There could be cyber attacks, which already we've seen some indication of. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1067.4399999999998s)]
*  There's a possibility that the Russians could arm [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1072.3200000000002s)]
*  the separatists in the Donbass region. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1075.0800000000002s)]
*  So it's still a very tenuous situation. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1077.68s)]
*  But in many ways, this is exactly what Mr. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1080.64s)]
*  Putin wants and how he likes it to kind of keep the West guessing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1084.16s)]
*  You know, you're in Moscow and I'm curious to get your thoughts [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1089.92s)]
*  about what Russians think. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1092.2s)]
*  How do Russian citizens feel about a potential invasion of Ukraine? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1093.72s)]
*  Would such an attack be received well? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1097.8400000000001s)]
*  Are they aware? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1100.48s)]
*  Do you think that they have a sense of what the international community [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  might do in response? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1105.48s)]
*  And do you get a sense that they think, hey, you know what? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1106.3600000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is just simply not worth what would happen to us [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1108.8s)]
*  if Vladimir Putin goes ahead with this. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1114.0s)]
*  Well, there are several schools of thought here. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1117.44s)]
*  You certainly do read about this talk of invasion in the newspapers [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1120.0s)]
*  and listen to it, hear about it on talk shows. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1124.52s)]
*  Many Russians have Ukrainian relatives. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1127.8799999999999s)]
*  And the last thing they want is a war in Ukraine or with Ukraine. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1130.8s)]
*  Also, eastern Ukraine, the territory that would be probably [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  where a first incursion would occur, because that is where there are [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1142.0s)]
*  separatists who are very much in favour of having some kind of closer [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1146.04s)]
*  connection to Russia. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1150.48s)]
*  That particular region is not Crimea. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1153.08s)]
*  In 2014, as we know, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1155.28s)]
*  And Russians were in general extremely happy and pleased about that. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1160.56s)]
*  They thought that, you know, they think that that is traditionally [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1164.56s)]
*  a part of Russia. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1168.96s)]
*  But for eastern Ukraine, there is not a lot of talk about, you know, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1170.56s)]
*  supporting an invasion into eastern Ukraine. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1176.72s)]
*  Many Russians will tell you all of this provocation, all of this talk, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1181.76s)]
*  its politics, and a lot of them blame the West for kind of beating [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1187.68s)]
*  the drum of war. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WasDyEt8kno&t=1192.72s)]
