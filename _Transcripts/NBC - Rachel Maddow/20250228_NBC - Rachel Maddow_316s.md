Video Description: Rachel Maddow points out two surprising but mostly overlooked revelations that came from Donald Trump's Oval Office meltdown over his inability to arrange a deal with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. One is Trump revealing the last time he spoke with Vladimir Putin, something about which he is typically cagey. The second is the surprising presence in the room of a news organization that was not invited.

# Maddow: Two new details learned from Trump's Oval Office meltdown
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs)
*  At the start of this made-for-TV debacle at the White House today, where the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=0.0s)]
*  and vice president, J.D. Vance, screamed at our ally, Vladimir Zelensky, and berated him [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=6.78s)]
*  with Russian government talking points. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=13.1s)]
*  When this happened today in Washington, there's a couple things that stuck out to me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=16.14s)]
*  First of all, at the very start of this photo op, they had all the press in the room, Trump [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=22.46s)]
*  was asked right at the outset when he last spoke with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=28.06s)]
*  He said, quote, a couple of days ago, which was news because the U.S. government had said [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  nothing about Donald Trump speaking with Vladimir Putin a couple of days ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=36.86s)]
*  So that's new. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=42.5s)]
*  He used to say, I'm not allowed to talk about that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=43.5s)]
*  Now he's admitting that he talks to Putin all the time, even when the U.S. government [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=45.56s)]
*  doesn't release any information about those calls like they do with all other foreign [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  leaders. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=52.8s)]
*  Second was the truly bizarre revelation that Russian state-controlled media, for some reason, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=55.46s)]
*  was in the Oval Office today when this scene happened with Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=65.5s)]
*  Now, to be clear, the Trump White House will not allow the Associated Press or Reuters [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  into the Oval Office to cover White House events anymore, but somehow TASS media, Kremlin-controlled [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=76.34s)]
*  Russian state media, somehow made their way into the Oval Office for this berating of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=82.94s)]
*  the Ukrainian president today, and Russian state media was in the Oval Office, somehow [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=89.54s)]
*  live streaming from the event. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=95.62s)]
*  Afterwards, look at this bizarre statement from the White House, attributed to an unnamed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  White House official, quote, TASS was not on the approved list of media for today's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=104.26s)]
*  pool. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=108.7s)]
*  As soon as it came to the attention of press office staff that he was in the Oval, he was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=109.7s)]
*  escorted out by the press secretary. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=113.26s)]
*  He is not on the approved list for the press conference. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=115.26s)]
*  It's not on the approved list. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  I have no idea how he got in there to live stream for Kremlin-controlled state media [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=121.06s)]
*  the president and vice president of the United States screaming at Ukraine's president and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  berating him with Russian talking points. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=135.54000000000002s)]
*  We don't know how the Kremlin guy got in here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=139.58s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=141.22s)]
*  He just wandered in. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=142.22s)]
*  I mean, people do. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=143.22s)]
*  It's a free country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=144.22s)]
*  People do just wander into the Oval Office. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=146.9s)]
*  A very radical thing is happening in our country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  It is not only radical in the sense that it is a large directional change, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=156.62s)]
*  Switching sides in a war, now standing against our allies of the last 80 years, now siding [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  with Russia instead. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=167.42s)]
*  No longer siding with the free world, now siding with the authoritarian governments [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  of the world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  It's not just radical in that it is a 180-degree directional change. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  It is also radical in the sense that it is really radically unpopular with the American [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=187.1s)]
*  You can see that in the polling. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=189.66s)]
*  Quinnipiac poll this month. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=191.14s)]
*  Should the U.S. trust Vladimir Putin? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=192.54s)]
*  Yes, 9%. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=194.66s)]
*  No, 81%. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=195.94s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=199.26s)]
*  The economist Yucav poll out this month. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=200.26s)]
*  Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Vladimir Putin? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  The American public say favorable, 11%. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=205.7s)]
*  Unfavorable, 78%. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=209.1s)]
*  The American people are not clamoring for us to ally ourselves with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=212.94s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=218.34s)]
*  You can see it very clearly in the polling. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  And it begs the question, well, okay, who wants this? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=225.3s)]
*  Who voted for this? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=227.94s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=228.94s)]
*  If the American people don't want this, why are we doing it? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=230.74s)]
*  Who says we should do this? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=237.06s)]
*  Who's making us do this? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  And why? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  And for whose benefit? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=244.66000000000003s)]
*  You can see the same dynamic in the bewildered and outraged questions that Americans are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=246.66s)]
*  asking their Republican members of Congress at these town halls, which Republicans are [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=251.06s)]
*  now realizing they better not do any more of. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  They're asking their Republican senators and their Republican members of Congress, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=259.02s)]
*  what the heck is going on? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=262.18s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=263.78s)]
*  But let's be clear. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, what's going on here is pretty obvious at this point. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  Because this is all really good news for somebody. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=275.74s)]
*  It's not the American people for whom it's good. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  It's not our allies for whom it's good. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=280.94s)]
*  And this is nothing that anyone campaigned on, and it is nothing that anyone has any [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=283.02s)]
*  political mandate for at all. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=287.38s)]
*  And so why are we doing it? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=289.58s)]
*  And what are we going to do about it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=292.3s)]
*  That's what we have to decide. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSW8ezOmYHs&t=294.58s)]
