# Ukrainians Regain Ground As Russians Abruptly Decamp From Key Positions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE)
*  Belgarod is 25 miles north of Kharkiv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's on the other side of the country from where I am standing tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=3.0s)]
*  It's only about an hour's drive away from Ukraine's second largest city, that is Kharkiv. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=6.4s)]
*  Look at what happened in the Russian city of Belgarod today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at these missiles coming out of the sky and those helicopters flying really [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=16.0s)]
*  low and then what appears to be an explosion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=19.8s)]
*  This was a fuel depot inside Belgarod, inside Russia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=23.42s)]
*  Russia immediately claimed today that Ukraine was responsible for this attack. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=28.52s)]
*  It said it was a significant escalation that could complicate peace talks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=32.019999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine refused to confirm or deny that it was responsible for the strike, but NBC News [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  has confirmed that this was the handiwork of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=41.8s)]
*  Which is a bold move. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=47.6s)]
*  This is Ukraine's first known airstrike on Russian soil since this invasion began, and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=49.72s)]
*  it's just one item on a very long list of Ukrainian military victories in the last 24 [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=55.04s)]
*  hours. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=61.44s)]
*  The Pentagon says that the airport outside of Kiev has been abandoned by Russian forces. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=62.44s)]
*  This was an incredibly important target for Russia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=68.44s)]
*  Control of this specific airport would have allowed Russia to fly troops directly to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=71.48s)]
*  capital and not worry about getting stuck in the mud or roadblocks or running out of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=77.16s)]
*  fuel as their tanks have been doing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  But now they've abandoned it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=84.92s)]
*  You can see it in this new satellite image from Maxar tonight. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=86.2s)]
*  If you see those big piles of dirt everywhere, those are protective berms that Russia built [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=89.04s)]
*  up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=95.8s)]
*  They're earthen walls in front of their military vehicles and tanks to keep them protected. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=96.8s)]
*  Well now Russia has rolled up and left the airport. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=101.8s)]
*  All that's left are their walls of dirt. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=104.64s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=108.0s)]
*  This was a small village east of Kharkiv today called Malarogan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=109.0s)]
*  This town was previously under Russian control, but Ukrainians have now taken it back. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=113.64s)]
*  As they mount a series of counterattacks across the country, Ukrainian soldiers surveyed damage [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=118.28s)]
*  to these Russian tanks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=123.36s)]
*  Another soldier found a set of Russian military documents that had somehow stayed intact in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=125.68s)]
*  all the rubble. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=130.44s)]
*  British intelligence sources said today that Ukraine has also retaken two villages south [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=132.16s)]
*  of Chernihiv, which are located along important supply routes to the nation's capital. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=137.24s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=143.4s)]
*  This is the Kyiv suburb of Borodnanka today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=144.4s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers held up their blue and yellow flag after Russian soldiers abandoned [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=148.12s)]
*  the city without a fight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  On the outskirts of Kyiv, a suburb called Buzha was one of the first cities to be taken [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=155.24s)]
*  over by Russia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=160.22s)]
*  It's been in Russian control since the end of February. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=161.22s)]
*  The mayor of Buzha himself was reportedly injured last month when the city came under [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=165.02s)]
*  heavy shelling. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=169.52s)]
*  Last night on Telegram, the mayor announced his city is now free. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=171.0s)]
*  Ukraine has retaken control of Buzha. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=174.68s)]
*  He said the day will forever go down in the history of their town. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=178.0s)]
*  A reporter for the Kyiv Independent newspaper today said that Ukrainian soldiers are retaking [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  cities around Kyiv at such a rapid clip that he barely has time to redraw the lines on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  his map. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=193.08s)]
*  That same reporter said today that he believes we're at an unmistakable turning point in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=194.08s)]
*  this war. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=199.16000000000003s)]
*  What we have is the another face of the war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=201.52s)]
*  And it's just we get it not from, you know, Russian statements or something, but just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=204.12s)]
*  because of the very nature that has changed over the last, let's say, a week or so. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  This is very clear in terms of, you know, the Battle of Kyiv. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  I personally believe that the Battle of Kyiv is over with the Russian defeat. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  With Russia on the retreat all around Ukraine's capital, it's a good opportunity to take stock [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=225.3s)]
*  of what Russia has lost since this invasion began. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=229.4s)]
*  U.S. officials believe that the Russian army has already committed more than half of its [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=233.32s)]
*  total combat forces of the entire country to the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=238.16s)]
*  As many as 15,000 Russian soldiers are believed to have died, including at least seven high-ranking [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=243.3s)]
*  generals. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=250.6s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting today that Russia is running its military strategy out [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=251.6s)]
*  of Moscow with, quote, no central war commander to call the shots, end quote, which perhaps [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=255.18s)]
*  explains the haphazard nature of this invasion from one of the largest militaries on planet [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=260.7s)]
*  Earth. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=266.26s)]
*  The Times reports that with the majority of their military already deployed, Russia has [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=267.82s)]
*  now begun looking for reinforcements outside of Russia, drafting soldiers from the nation [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=272.14s)]
*  of Georgia, bringing in mercenaries from a private military company. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=277.22s)]
*  Putin has signed a decree to call up tens of thousands of conscripts. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=280.9s)]
*  The British Ministry of Defense said today that it's highly unlikely that Russia planned [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=287.17999999999995s)]
*  on tapping reinforcements this way and indicates that the scale of the losses that it has sustained [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=291.46s)]
*  during the invasion is higher than anyone expected. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=296.73999999999995s)]
*  . [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePY6Ht8DGjE&t=310.9s)]
