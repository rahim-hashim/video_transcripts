# U.S. considers action to counter anti-gay hate stoked in Uganda by American evangelicals
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg)
*  Do you personally dislike homosexuals? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course they are disgusting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=4.0s)]
*  What sort of people are they? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=6.0s)]
*  That was the president of Uganda in 2014. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=9.0s)]
*  That was the day after he signed into law [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=12.0s)]
*  a really radical piece of legislation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=15.0s)]
*  It was referred to worldwide as the kill the gays bill [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=18.0s)]
*  because the original version of that law called just for that, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=23.0s)]
*  called for executing people for the grave crime of being gay. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=27.0s)]
*  Now, if you've been watching this show from the beginning, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=31.0s)]
*  you might remember that we covered the fight over that law extensively at the time, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=34.0s)]
*  not just because it was so extreme, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=38.0s)]
*  but also because there was a big American connection to it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=40.0s)]
*  Some of the architects of that bill were Americans, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=43.0s)]
*  radical anti-gay evangelical activists and preachers [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=47.0s)]
*  who went to Uganda to sell what they couldn't get done here in this country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=52.0s)]
*  to a different country where they thought they could get away with it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=57.0s)]
*  These groups carried on a multi-year campaign [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=61.0s)]
*  to get radical anti-gay legislation passed in Uganda. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=64.0s)]
*  And they succeeded. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=68.0s)]
*  In 2014, the kill the gays law was signed into law in Uganda. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=70.0s)]
*  And what happened next was interesting. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=74.0s)]
*  It was not just the expected legal challenges within that country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=77.0s)]
*  We also saw a very strong stand from the Obama White House at the time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=81.0s)]
*  This was from the Obama administration's press release at the time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=86.0s)]
*  That was the Obama administration in 2014. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=111.0s)]
*  The Obama administration also pushed that country in other really specific ways. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=114.0s)]
*  They canceled joint military exercises that the U.S. had planned with Uganda. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=120.0s)]
*  The Obama administration pulled millions of dollars [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=125.0s)]
*  that had been planned to be given to that country in support of their country's policing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=128.0s)]
*  The U.S. at the time had planned to open a national public health institute in Uganda. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=132.0s)]
*  Instead, the Obama administration withdrew the millions of dollars [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=137.0s)]
*  that had planned for that endeavor [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=140.0s)]
*  and moved the entire institute to another country instead. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=142.0s)]
*  The Obama White House used all these powers at its disposal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=145.0s)]
*  And it seems to have made a difference. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=149.0s)]
*  I mean, those efforts were not the only reason [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=152.0s)]
*  that Uganda's anti-gay law fell apart in 2014, but it fell apart. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=155.0s)]
*  The law was challenged in court there in Uganda by the U.S. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=159.0s)]
*  It was eventually struck down by Ugandan courts on technical grounds. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=163.0s)]
*  But the big shove on this issue from the United States, by all accounts, made a difference. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=167.0s)]
*  Now, in 2023, it's back. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=174.0s)]
*  It's worse in some ways. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=177.0s)]
*  And this new legislation, once again, comes against a backdrop of Americans being forced to do the same thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=180.0s)]
*  Once again, a backdrop of U.S. anti-gay evangelical groups pouring resources [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=187.0s)]
*  into advocating for this anti-gay agenda in Uganda. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=192.0s)]
*  And now that same Ugandan president, the one who said he thinks gay people are disgusting, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=196.0s)]
*  he has now signed into law an even harsher piece of legislation than what was passed in 2014. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=200.0s)]
*  This new bill, it was passed in 2014, and it's a new law. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=207.0s)]
*  It's a new law. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=211.0s)]
*  This new law imposes, yes, the death penalty for what they call aggravated homosexuality, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=213.0s)]
*  life in prison for anybody engaging in gay sex. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=220.0s)]
*  This new law makes it illegal to even advocate for LGBTQ people to have rights. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=223.0s)]
*  Even advocacy of gay rights carries a penalty of 20 years in prison. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=229.0s)]
*  If you are LGBTQ, you are living in your own country. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=233.0s)]
*  If you are LGBTQ, you are living in Uganda right now, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=239.0s)]
*  it is an understatement to say the situation on the ground there is terrifying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=244.0s)]
*  Lots of people are fleeing the country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=248.0s)]
*  Other people have not left their homes since the legislation was signed into law [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=250.0s)]
*  for fear they will be targeted either by the government or by mob justice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=255.0s)]
*  So it's happening again. This time it's worse. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=261.0s)]
*  Here's a question for us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=265.0s)]
*  Is there an American government response that could be helpful here [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=267.0s)]
*  in the way that the U.S. response, that strong response, was helpful in 2014? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=271.0s)]
*  How much of a special responsibility does the U.S. have in fixing things [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=276.0s)]
*  given the role of certain Americans in cultivating this stuff over there? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=280.0s)]
*  But also, does the U.S. have a special opportunity as a country, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=285.0s)]
*  not just a responsibility to do it, but an opportunity to help? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=290.0s)]
*  Given that we've done it before, so far the Biden administration [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=294.0s)]
*  has talked about measures, is considering measures that very much track [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=298.0s)]
*  exactly with what the Obama White House did the last time around [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=302.0s)]
*  when this was in the headlines in 2013 and 2014. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=305.0s)]
*  The question is whether or not 10 years down the road, that's enough. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=308.0s)]
*  Whether the U.S. could be doing something else or pushing even more aggressively, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=312.0s)]
*  because the Ugandan government obviously knew what to expect from us. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=316.0s)]
*  They saw it 10 years ago. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=320.0s)]
*  They went ahead and did it anyway this time, in full anticipation of what we would do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=322.0s)]
*  So can the U.S. response be amped up to account for that, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=327.0s)]
*  for how much more danger people are at, particularly since we are part of the problem [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=331.0s)]
*  for how we got into this mess in the first place? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=336.0s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_BfK7P4Myg&t=340.0s)]
