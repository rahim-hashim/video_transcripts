# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 23
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4)
*  So at the top of the show, I went through a long but definitely not exhaustive list of the known [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=0.0s)]
*  lies of freshman Republican Congressman George Santos of New York. You're probably familiar with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=5.68s)]
*  some of the greatest hits by now, the volleyball star and Wall Street fortune and all that stuff, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=11.28s)]
*  right? But here's something you have not heard before. Did you know that Congressman George [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=16.8s)]
*  Santos also claims he was the target of an assassination attempt, which required him being [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=21.28s)]
*  put under official police protection? That is what George Santos claimed last month in an interview [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=26.96s)]
*  with a Brazilian podcast. The podcast is called Radio Novello Apresenta. Forgive my pronunciation, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=33.44s)]
*  Radio Novello Apresenta. They shared this video from the interview exclusively with us. So you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=40.88s)]
*  won't see this anywhere else, but I want you to see it. In this interview, then Congressman-elect [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=48.24s)]
*  George Santos is speaking with the hosts in Portuguese. So we have subtitled it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=53.12s)]
*  He starts off talking about an alleged act of vandalism, which he says was targeted at him [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=58.96s)]
*  simply because he's a Republican. But then in the midst of that, he says, oh, also someone tried to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=64.0s)]
*  murder him. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=69.6s)]
*  We have already suffered an attempt on my life, an assassination attempt. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=83.04s)]
*  There was an assassination attempt, really. Then Congressman-elect George Santos did not elaborate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=113.12s)]
*  on his claim in the interview. We have tonight reached out to Congressman Santos's office [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  to get more information about him saying that he was the victim of an attempted murder, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  getting New York police protection at his home as a result. There ought to be a record of that sort [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=131.44s)]
*  of thing if it happened. We've inquired about this claim from him. We have not heard back. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=135.52s)]
*  We do live in hope. Mr. Santos did offer more detail about a different act of violence, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=139.12s)]
*  he says was committed against him. In this interview with the same Brazilian podcast, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=144.4s)]
*  he said he was the victim of a very, very, very brazen mugging in the middle of the day, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  in the middle of one of New York City's busiest thoroughfares. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=156.08s)]
*  It is surreal what we live through here. Yes, surreal is one word for it. I love that the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=199.52s)]
*  podcast host interrupts him there. Santos says, it was three in the afternoon, I was leaving my [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=215.68s)]
*  office, going to the garage, getting my car and I was mugged. They robbed me, took my briefcase, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=221.76s)]
*  took my shoes and my watch. The host then interrupts him and says, they stole your shoes [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=226.32s)]
*  in the middle of Fifth Avenue? Really? The podcast hosts actually say they later asked [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=232.72s)]
*  George Santos for the police report for his mugging on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Street at 3 p.m. in the middle of the day when they took, among other things, his shoes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=245.04s)]
*  But they say they never heard back from him when they asked for the police report. We have also [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  asked Congressman Santos' office for that police report. We will let you know if we hear anything. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=254.96s)]
*  We've also put in a records request with the NYPD for any police report that matches what Mr. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=261.44s)]
*  Santos described. We live in hope. But perhaps the most magnificent moment of this interview [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=266.32s)]
*  comes when Congressman Santos tries to explain to these podcast hosts why it is that he personally [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  takes such a hard line toward undocumented immigrants when he himself comes from a family [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=281.92s)]
*  of immigrants. Watch. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=287.44s)]
*  I'm assiduously critical of people who want to start their American dream the wrong way. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=311.92s)]
*  Imagine starting a relationship with a lie. Imagine starting a relationship with a lie. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  Imagine how awful that would be. Because, of course, he would never lie. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=344.88s)]
*  Your Republican Congress at work. Republican Congressman George Santos. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=352.08s)]
*  The other big national security story we're following tonight is an absolutely shocking [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  arrest and indictment of a senior FBI counterintelligence official. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=363.28s)]
*  This story is legitimately shocking. Do you remember the name Oleg Deripaska from the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=370.08s)]
*  Mueller investigation from all the Mishigas around Paul Manafort, the now convicted felon who served [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  as campaign chairman for the Trump campaign in 2016? The name Oleg Deripaska is a Russian name. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  It's sometimes if you're not as familiar with a lot of different Russian names, it can be hard [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=389.28s)]
*  to remember these things. I feel like he is one of the more memorable ones, if only because we [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=394.4s)]
*  heard his name so many times amid the whole Russia scandal. When we learned in the lead up [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=398.88s)]
*  to the 2016 election that Russia was messing with our election to try to help Trump get elected, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  one of the single most bananas revelations of that whole time period, it was more bananas than that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  photo of Trump's national security adviser sitting at a table with Putin in Russia at an event for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=418.24s)]
*  which a Russian propaganda agency paid him thousands of dollars to be there. It was more [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=424.08s)]
*  bananas than the revelation that even though Trump said he had no business dealings in Russia, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=428.48s)]
*  on the night of the third Republican presidential candidates debate, Trump secretly signed a letter [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=433.12s)]
*  of intent to build the biggest real estate project of his life in Moscow. The revelation [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=438.56s)]
*  about Oleg Deripaska was more bananas than all of that. For me, in terms of revelatory moments in [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=444.08s)]
*  the middle of that scandal, this still sticks out to me as the one that was the most astonishing thing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=451.28s)]
*  to learn in the moment that I learned it. It was March 2017, an Associated Press report, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=457.12s)]
*  so this is a public report after we had already learned in 2016 that Russia had intervened in our [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  election in every way they could to try to get Trump into the White House. In March 2017, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=469.76s)]
*  this AP report crossed the wires saying that Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  had been paid on a multi-million dollar annual multi-year contract to promote the interests of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=482.08s)]
*  the Putin government in the United States and around the world. I mean, the guy running the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=491.2s)]
*  Trump campaign while Russia's trying to get him elected, that guy is on a multi-million dollar [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=497.84s)]
*  annual contract to promote Putin's interests? How is this? Yeah, the man reportedly paying Manafort [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=504.0s)]
*  to promote the Kremlin's interests in the United States was an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=510.88s)]
*  named Oleg Deripaska. Oleg Deripaska and Paul Manafort were in business together in various [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=515.68s)]
*  ways for years and years and years. Oleg Deripaska is all over the Mueller report. His name appears [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=522.32s)]
*  in the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report on what Russia did in the 2016 election. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=529.44s)]
*  Deripaska's name is in that report more than 300 times. Oleg Deripaska ended up getting sanctioned [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=534.08s)]
*  by the U.S. government for his key role in Russia's efforts to mess with the 2016 U.S. election. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=541.0400000000001s)]
*  That's Oleg Deripaska. And now look at tonight's headline in the New York Times. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=547.44s)]
*  Former top FBI official in New York charged with aiding oligarch, prosecutors say Charles McGonigal, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=551.36s)]
*  who was chief of counterintelligence in New York City, worked secretly for Oleg Deripaska. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  We've got a picture on the front page of the New York Times of Oleg Deripaska. Again, he's back. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=564.96s)]
*  For the craziest of all possible reasons. I mean, here's the headline in the Washington Post tonight. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=570.88s)]
*  Former senior FBI official accused of working for Russian, he investigated. Charles McGonigal, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=574.4s)]
*  former counterintelligence chief, is charged with money laundering and other counts connected to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=583.04s)]
*  oligarch Oleg Deripaska. McGonigal was a senior counterintelligence official at FBI headquarters [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=587.12s)]
*  until last year. He was a former FBI chief. He was a former FBI chief. He was a former FBI chief. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=595.28s)]
*  Late 2016, just before the 2016 election in October 2016, they moved him from FBI headquarters [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=600.88s)]
*  to the New York field office to be the special agent in charge of counterintelligence there. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=609.36s)]
*  McGonigal was arrested this weekend at JFK airport in New York. They indicted him today in D.C. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=614.8s)]
*  for taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from an Albanian intelligence officer while he was [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=622.72s)]
*  on the job at FBI headquarters in D.C. They also indicted him in New York, where he's charged with [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=628.48s)]
*  being on Oleg Deripaska's payroll and also with taking steps to hide it because, of course, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  Deripaska is sanctioned by the U.S. government, so nobody in the United States should be in business [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=638.72s)]
*  with him anymore. Charles McGonigal retired from the FBI after 22 years in 2018. 2018 is the same [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=643.28s)]
*  year Deripaska was sanctioned by the U.S. government. McGonigal is charged with being on [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  Deripaska's payroll basically through a law firm starting in 2019 and then eventually getting paid [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=655.04s)]
*  by Deripaska directly starting in 2021. Deripaska was criminally charged with evading sanctions [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=660.64s)]
*  last year. The FBI raided two homes associated with Deripaska, both in New York and D.C. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  But, I mean, what of that investigation now? Because now this special agent in charge, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  the senior FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=682.24s)]
*  Russian oligarchs, including Deripaska, now he is charged with secretly working for that same guy [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=687.76s)]
*  and secretly taking money from him. As the Times notes tonight, this shows, among other things, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=693.84s)]
*  that the reach of Russia's oligarchs can extend even into the heart of U.S. law enforcement. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=701.28s)]
*  These revelations and these indictments also raise huge questions [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=706.8s)]
*  about the incredibly sensitive counterintelligence information that this FBI official had access to. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=711.12s)]
*  I mean, he was a very senior counterintelligence official. Among other things, he was reportedly [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=717.52s)]
*  the lead FBI investigator looking into why it was that U.S. intelligence assets were getting arrested [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=722.4s)]
*  and murdered in China all of a sudden. I mean, these were people who were, you know, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, these were people who were losing their lives to work with our country. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=734.96s)]
*  The guy charged with investigating how it was that they were being exposed and how it was [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=740.72s)]
*  that they were starting to get murdered, he himself was allegedly being paid by foreign [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=744.96s)]
*  governments and spies. I only know what I read in the spy books and what I read in the indictments, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=749.9200000000001s)]
*  but from a national security perspective, this seems very bad. It also just seems very, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=757.84s)]
*  unusual. Joining us now is someone who really does know these things and not just from spy novels. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=764.48s)]
*  Mary McCord served as the top national security official at the U.S. Department of Justice. She's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=771.6s)]
*  now executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=776.08s)]
*  Georgetown Law School. Mary McCord, it's a real pleasure and an honor to have you here tonight. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=780.48s)]
*  Thank you for taking time. Thank you for having me. First, let me just ask you if what I just [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=784.24s)]
*  described about the McGonigal case is fair. Just looking at this as a lay observer, as somebody [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=791.2s)]
*  who reads the news and can read the public-facing documents here, it just seems like this must be an [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=796.48s)]
*  incredibly rare and unusual thing. I mean, this is a senior FBI official from the counterintelligence [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=802.6400000000001s)]
*  side of things charged with being paid by people he was investigating and people with ties to foreign [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=807.44s)]
*  governments and foreign intelligence services. This seems like kind of a unicorn case. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=814.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes. Well, you know, any time that you have a law enforcement official at any level, federal, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=819.04s)]
*  state, local, who abuses the trust placed in them by virtue of their position, you know, that's a [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=825.5999999999999s)]
*  very bad thing and it's very dangerous for public safety and it really erodes the feeling of [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  Americans and the ability to have faith in their law enforcement. But this is magnified so many [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=839.12s)]
*  times because this is just an astonishing abuse of that trust when you're talking about somebody [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=845.04s)]
*  who's not only betraying his office and putting Americans at, you know, at risk in terms of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=851.04s)]
*  public safety here in the U.S. He is actually doing this on behalf of foreign adversaries. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=858.64s)]
*  And this is somebody who through his job was cleared, I'm sure, at the very highest levels [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=865.04s)]
*  in terms of our classified information, privy to sensitive information about intelligence collection, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=870.8s)]
*  about what adversaries such as Putin and the Russian government, such as in some cases the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  Chinese government, privy to the various tactics and techniques that they've utilized to meddle in [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=883.28s)]
*  various U.S. affairs. And this is somebody who had access to all of that. And now to learn that not [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=890.7199999999999s)]
*  only did he betray that trust after he left the FBI, but also while he was still in the FBI, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=897.12s)]
*  it's really staggering. And I'm very glad to see that the department and the FBI has come down hard [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=903.52s)]
*  on him. And, you know, with indictments in two different jurisdictions for multiple crimes, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=909.92s)]
*  serious crimes. And you're right, I've not seen this very often. So far there's no espionage [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=916.8s)]
*  at charges, and I hope there never will be because I hope there'll never be any evidence [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=924.16s)]
*  that he actually provided the information he was privy to, to any of our foreign adversaries. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  But this is very, very serious in so many ways. Now, I should mention Charles McGonigal did plead [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=933.92s)]
*  not guilty to the charges filed against him in New York. If he is found guilty, if he is convicted [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=940.7199999999999s)]
*  based on the just the statutory sentences associated with the statutes under which he's [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  charged, he's looking at potentially decades in prison. And it's serious for all the reasons [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=952.16s)]
*  that you described. I do find myself wondering today, though, whether or not he is convicted. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=957.04s)]
*  Is this potentially a problem for any of the counterintelligence prosecutions that he played [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=962.7199999999999s)]
*  a role in? For example, just when it comes to Oleg Deripaska, we know that the FBI raided homes [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=968.64s)]
*  associated with Mr. Deripaska last year. We know that he's been charged with trying to evade sanctions. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=974.0s)]
*  We also now know that Mr. McGonigal, who was involved in the Deripaska investigation in cases [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=979.28s)]
*  related to him, as well as other oligarchs, has been allegedly compromised in multiple ways. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=985.76s)]
*  Does that potentially blow up some of the cases or all of the cases that he was involved in [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=991.8399999999999s)]
*  during his time in the FBI? Well, I'd add to that that the D.C. indictment also alleges that he was [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=997.6s)]
*  being paid by someone who later was actually a cooperating witness, a witness for in an [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1005.84s)]
*  investigation he was engaged in. So it gets the plot even thickens. But you're right. The [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1012.48s)]
*  Department of Justice will be now doing an analysis of cases that Mr. McGonigal had a hand in, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1017.84s)]
*  either as a supervisor or as an investigator, and will be looking carefully to see if there is any [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1025.04s)]
*  compromise or any Brady information. That would be information that the government is obligated [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1031.84s)]
*  to provide to defendants who've been charged with crimes where he may have had a hand. They'll be [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1037.6s)]
*  looking to see if there's anything they need to disclose, whether they need to dismiss cases, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1043.84s)]
*  and of course, whether even in past cases there's anything they might need to disclose. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1048.48s)]
*  Now, I will say this. In counterintelligence, unlike so many other areas of what the FBI's work, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1053.68s)]
*  much of that work does not actually result in criminal cases. The counterintelligence agents [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1060.8s)]
*  that I worked with, they would have been the first people to say to you, we don't really want any of [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  our cases to end in charges. We want to keep acquiring the intelligence that we need to try [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1071.28s)]
*  to keep the U.S. safe from national security threats from our adversaries. And so it's not [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1076.8799999999999s)]
*  the area where you see many, many, many charges. You don't even see nearly as many as you see with [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1082.32s)]
*  respect to counterterrorism and terrorism cases. And certainly nothing like what you see in other [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1088.64s)]
*  sort of run-of-the-mill criminal cases, even conspiracies, even white-collar conspiracies, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1095.8400000000001s)]
*  and drug conspiracies. Those are areas of the FBI that are much more focused on investigating a crime [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1100.3200000000002s)]
*  for a charging decision. Counterintelligence is about long-term investigations, understanding [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1106.5600000000002s)]
*  the tools and tactic techniques of our adversaries so that we can better counter those threats. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1112.3200000000002s)]
*  Which has sort of it's a good news, bad news thing in terms of potentially blowing up any [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1117.28s)]
*  charge, any cases that actually were charged and made it their way to court, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1123.52s)]
*  but also has potentially long-term and international consequences in terms of, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1127.76s)]
*  as you say, in terms of national security. Mary McCord, who served as Acting Assistant [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1132.1599999999999s)]
*  Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice now at Georgetown Law [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1136.56s)]
*  School. Ms. McCord, thank you very much for your time and your expertise tonight. It's really [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1140.2399999999998s)]
*  invaluable to have you here. You're welcome. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W27lSO9zA4&t=1177.12s)]
