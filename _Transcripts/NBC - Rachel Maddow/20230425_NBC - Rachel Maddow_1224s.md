# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM)
*  He was one of the best known people in the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=0.0s)]
*  He was on hundreds of radio stations [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=6.0s)]
*  at a time when radio stations were all we had. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=8.0s)]
*  The best estimates are that he, around 1936, around this time, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=11.0s)]
*  he had tens of millions of Americans listening to him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=16.0s)]
*  Again, this was a time when the country had a population of less than 130 million people. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=20.0s)]
*  But he had 30 million people listening to him every week? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=25.0s)]
*  His name was Father Charles Coughlin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=29.0s)]
*  And while he just became a bigger and bigger and bigger deal on the radio, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=31.0s)]
*  and he got more and more political and more and more radically right-wing in his political broadcasts, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=36.0s)]
*  you know, sometimes his views allied with the views in the interest of the Catholic Church, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=42.0s)]
*  sometimes they didn't, because he was such a big deal in the media. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=47.0s)]
*  You know, both Coughlin and the Church were well aware that, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=53.0s)]
*  with the possible exception of the Pope himself, and that's arguable, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=56.0s)]
*  Charles Coughlin was the most influential Catholic on earth. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=59.0s)]
*  So even though he was really, really controversial and getting more so all the time, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=63.0s)]
*  the Church gave him a wide berth. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=67.0s)]
*  Until they didn't. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=71.0s)]
*  He was a Catholic priest. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=73.0s)]
*  And he had had this bishop who came up with excuses for everything he said, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=75.0s)]
*  and covered for him and protected him. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=79.0s)]
*  His bishop died. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=80.0s)]
*  Coughlin had a new bishop who came in, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=82.0s)]
*  and the new bishop thought Coughlin was way too much of a headache for the Catholic Church, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=84.0s)]
*  and so they pulled the plug on him, took him off the radio, gone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=87.0s)]
*  Poof. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=90.0s)]
*  But the next closest sort of long shadow of that guy's influence was this guy, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=91.0s)]
*  who in the late 1980s started an AM radio career that changed AM radio. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=98.0s)]
*  It turned what had been a mix of sports broadcasts and religious services and kind of community service, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=105.0s)]
*  community access, sometimes even foreign language broadcasting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=110.0s)]
*  It turned all of that into a part of the American media that was just dominated by hardline right-wing talk radio. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=113.0s)]
*  He went to dozens and then hundreds of stations nationwide very quickly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=123.0s)]
*  He got himself literally a golden microphone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=129.0s)]
*  Like, you know, there's a certain kind of world leader who likes to show off that he's got a gun made out of gold. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=133.0s)]
*  This guy had a gold microphone that he made sure was in all his photos. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=138.0s)]
*  He was very proud of it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=142.0s)]
*  It was hugely successful. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=143.0s)]
*  He changed the whole purpose of that part of American media. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=144.0s)]
*  He spawned a thousand, if not thousands, of radio imitators that your angry great uncle probably still listens to today, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=149.0s)]
*  provided that he still has a terrestrial radio. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=157.0s)]
*  You know, at his height, he really seemed like his potential was limitless, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=161.0s)]
*  like his influence would just keep growing and growing and growing until it didn't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=164.0s)]
*  Then after him, there was this guy who also built a fast growing audience on right-wing AM talk radio. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=170.0s)]
*  And then he was brought onto television and he did well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=177.0s)]
*  He was brought onto the Fox News Channel and he got huge ratings at the Fox News Channel [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=180.0s)]
*  with his sort of signature, elaborate conspiracy theories that he would draw out on a chalkboard. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=186.0s)]
*  But at the Fox News Channel, he was their fastest growing star, which they must have been very happy with at Fox News. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=192.0s)]
*  Until they weren't. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=199.0s)]
*  He was fired. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=203.0s)]
*  And now he has like a website at the time slot he used to be on, which again, he set ratings records at this weird time slot he was on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=204.0s)]
*  After he left, they filled that time slot with like an ensemble show that turns out also does great in the ratings without him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=214.0s)]
*  And they don't have anybody whose name you'd know off the top of your head at all. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=221.0s)]
*  Then it was this guy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=224.0s)]
*  This guy actually was the biggest host that Fox ever had and their marquee primetime spot. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=225.0s)]
*  He was the most dominant voice in right-wing television ever. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=231.0s)]
*  Until he wasn't. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=236.0s)]
*  He too fired in 2017 in his case, and now he does like YouTube videos, I think, from his home. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=238.0s)]
*  Now there's this guy, their latest big hit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=246.0s)]
*  And he's out today as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=251.0s)]
*  He's been fired. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=254.0s)]
*  I think it's easier when you look at them as a group to get to what matters about them for the country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=255.0s)]
*  Because what you get if you squint at this this series of guys who are dominant for their time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=261.0s)]
*  Well, what you realize over time is that as time has gone forward, if you look at this over, you know, the last few years, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=270.0s)]
*  90 years spread of time, you see that over time, whoever the dominant figure is in right-wing radio or right-wing media, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=278.0s)]
*  the right-wing media industry, whatever it is, whoever is dominant for their time gets smaller and smaller and smaller over time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=286.0s)]
*  I mean, and I mean, don't get me wrong, there is a constancy here, right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=295.0s)]
*  You get unnervingly similar messaging from these guys over the decades and over the generations, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=299.0s)]
*  They all say some version of trust no one except, of course, me, because I'll give it to you straight. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=305.0s)]
*  Nobody else will. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=311.0s)]
*  They also tend to say, I know what God wants. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=312.0s)]
*  And obviously what God wants is what I want. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=315.0s)]
*  And I therefore can tell you who's evil and must be eliminated. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=317.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a constancy in terms of the way they perform. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=320.0s)]
*  They all sing a version of that same song. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=323.0s)]
*  You are right to see commonalities among them in style and in terms of the kind of appeal they have, the kind of thing they're selling, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=325.0s)]
*  the way they try to get Americans to hate each other and resent each other and particularly the way they try to get Americans to hate minority groups. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=332.0s)]
*  But I also think it can be overstated, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=340.0s)]
*  Even though there's always one of them who is dominant, the magnitude of their dominance decreases over time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=346.0s)]
*  And you can see that when you look at who's been the dominant figure in decade after decade, generation after generation, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=354.0s)]
*  as big as any of these modern guys are, there's never ever going to be anyone as dominant as Father Charles Coughlin was in the 1930s. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=360.0s)]
*  And as big as the broadcasters were, you know, in the 80s and 90s, they'll never compete with Coughlin. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=369.0s)]
*  And the broadcasters who were huge in the 80s and 90s, they were more dominant in their time than any of the flavor of the month broadcasters are dominant now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=376.0s)]
*  So we have a dominant figure almost always. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=385.0s)]
*  There's somebody who's dominating. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=389.0s)]
*  But the magnitude of their dominance, their overall importance to the media, the right-wing media ecosystem, it just shrinks as right-wing media over time diversifies and becomes a lot of different things and something that exists on a lot of different platforms. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=390.0s)]
*  So they'll never be somebody as big as the biggest guys of the past were. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=406.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Jay Rosen. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=413.0s)]
*  He's a professor of journalism at New York University and a longtime observer of this part of the media world. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=415.0s)]
*  Mr. Rosen, I really appreciate you making time to be here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=422.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=424.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=425.0s)]
*  First, let me just ask you to tear me apart and tell me if you think there's anything that I'm fundamentally wrong about or missing or getting the wrong way around about that take on the strength of the conservative media and its stars. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=427.0s)]
*  Nothing wrong, but there is something missing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=442.0s)]
*  Let me introduce you to verification in reverse, which I think is a factor in this history that you're recounting for us. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=445.0s)]
*  Verification is taking something that might be true and trying to nail it down with facts, evidence, expertise. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=453.0s)]
*  Verification in reverse is when you take something that's already been nailed down and you introduce doubt about it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=461.0s)]
*  And that releases a lot of energy, causes commotion, leads to controversy, leads to culture war. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=469.0s)]
*  And with this energy, you can power your political movement, MAGA. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=476.0s)]
*  Because MAGA works this way, the Republican Party looks less and less like a normal, traditional political party. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=481.0s)]
*  Because MAGA works this way, the conservative movement needs its own media system. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=492.0s)]
*  And this, I think, is a sort of hidden factor in history that you're recounting for us because it leads to absurdities like the debt limit battle, which is a crazy source of policies that are being suggested as you listed for us. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=498.0s)]
*  And this is also where Fox News fits in because Fox isn't really a news network because it doesn't believe in verification. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=517.0s)]
*  And so I would add that as a factor, not a cause, but a factor in the analysis you gave us, which was otherwise right on the mark. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=527.0s)]
*  If, as you say, reverse verification releases a lot of energy, you tell people this thing you thought was settled, this thing you knew was true, we're going to tell you it's not true, it's not settled, we're going to blow that up. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=539.0s)]
*  You said that releases a lot of energy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=554.0s)]
*  Is that process being interrupted by things like these sort of accountability moments like the Dominion lawsuit and like some of the other things that seem to be driving some of the internal crises in the biggest parts of the conservative media world? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=557.0s)]
*  That's why that case was so important, the Dominion case. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=572.0s)]
*  But overall, the conservative media world is built around the success of verification in reverse. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=576.0s)]
*  That's how Trump became a leading political figure with the missing birth certificate case. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=585.0s)]
*  That's what Stop the Steal was all about. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=592.0s)]
*  It's taking something that's been established as true, denying it, and the power of that denial moves your movement closer. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=596.0s)]
*  And that movement now is taking over the Republican Party, which is why the Democratic Party and the Republican Party no longer resemble each other. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=607.0s)]
*  That's why we have such an asymmetry in our politics, which screws around with a lot of other values and norms and practices that no longer make sense because the two parties operate in such a different way. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=615.0s)]
*  Also, I would add one other thing, Rachel, which is underneath that history that you gave us, there was the rise of the American consensus, as historians call it, the post-war consensus, where the two parties roughly worked in the same way and they had different values. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=629.0s)]
*  They wanted to take the country in different directions, but they kind of agreed on basic facts. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=645.0s)]
*  That world is completely gone now, and conservatives, so-called, exist in their own information sphere, which not only is separate from the mainstream media, but needs to constantly attack the mainstream media and its picture of the real in order to create that power and momentum that I talked about. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=651.0s)]
*  I feel like what you're describing, though, is a system that's kind of zooming towards entropy. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=672.0s)]
*  The only part of it that I feel like I can't discern from the way you're describing it is where it ends. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=678.0s)]
*  I mean, does that just continue to mushroom out, or is there some limiting factor that causes a crash? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=684.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm asking in really practical terms whether conservative media continues to be as rich as it is and as effective as it is, even with these dynamics that you're describing sort of accelerating right through to the end. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=692.0s)]
*  Right through today's news and right through this very extreme period on the right. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=707.0s)]
*  I want to give you my best professional answer. I don't know. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=710.0s)]
*  A humble man and a lost man. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=716.0s)]
*  I don't know where it's going either. What you're saying is it seems like this couldn't go on and on and on, but it does. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=720.0s)]
*  And it's given us Trump once and it may again. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=727.0s)]
*  And I don't think anyone knows where it's going. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=730.0s)]
*  It's heading for a crash or, as you say, it'll just continue. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=733.0s)]
*  Success in conservative media is a thing. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=737.0s)]
*  There's always someone. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=741.0s)]
*  It does not tend to translate to success anywhere other than the conservative media. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=744.0s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=748.0s)]
*  I mean, conservative media itself is a very big business. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=750.0s)]
*  It is very slick. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=753.0s)]
*  It is very successful as an entity in a way. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=754.0s)]
*  I'm sorry to say that partisan liberal media never has been not for one of trying. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=757.0s)]
*  Trust me. I know. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=762.0s)]
*  But what's actually important for the country, I think here is understanding what conservative media does, not overstating dominant conservative media figures as somehow standing, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=764.0s)]
*  bestride American culture and making things happen. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=777.0s)]
*  They all only exist in terms of their influence within conservative media. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=780.0s)]
*  But conservative media and the conservative movement are very effective. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=784.0s)]
*  They're rich, effective, successful, thriving enterprises. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=788.0s)]
*  And for at least the past generation, that really is where the political set success has been on the American right. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=793.0s)]
*  It's in conservative media and in the conservative movement. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=801.0s)]
*  That's where they are strongest. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=805.0s)]
*  And conservative media and the conservative movement tend to drag the actual Republican Party around like a rag doll that's missing a limb or two. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=808.0s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party is comparatively very weak, very disorganized and has no idea how to talk to people. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=816.0s)]
*  The Republican Party has lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=821.0s)]
*  I mean, look at the headlines in the other news from the right right now. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=828.0s)]
*  News that's not about the conservative media, news that's about the Republican Party. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=832.0s)]
*  Keep in mind that we are a democracy and your success as a political party depends on people liking your ideas and voting for them. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=837.0s)]
*  Look at what they're running on right now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=843.0s)]
*  Look at what they're doing in governance right now. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=845.0s)]
*  And think about the popularity of these things with the average American. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=847.0s)]
*  Look at the headlines right now. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=850.0s)]
*  Republicans voting to roll back child labor laws. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=852.0s)]
*  Lobbyists have found remarkable success among Republicans to relax regulations that prevent American children from working long hours in dangerous conditions. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=856.0s)]
*  OK, so they're crusading against child labor laws. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=866.0s)]
*  Republicans in Missouri vote to shut all public libraries. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=870.0s)]
*  Yeah, Americans sure hate libraries. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=875.0s)]
*  Republican controlled states go after millions of American families who right now have health insurance. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=879.0s)]
*  Because Republicans want to take away that health insurance from millions of American families and leave them with nothing. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=885.0s)]
*  That'll be popular. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=892.0s)]
*  Republicans fighting right now in dozens of states to load people up with student loans they otherwise wouldn't have to deal with. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=894.0s)]
*  Everybody's going to love that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=902.0s)]
*  Republicans blocking rape victims from receiving emergency contraception. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=904.0s)]
*  Because who among us doesn't see a mainstream American voting issue enforcing women who have been raped? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=910.0s)]
*  Forcing women who have been raped to bear the child of the rapist against their will. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=916.0s)]
*  That's a winning issue for the voters, I'm sure. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=922.0s)]
*  Republicans all over the country not only banning abortion, which is radically unpopular in this country, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=926.0s)]
*  but now in multiple states they are changing the rules of how laws can be made in those states so the people who live in those states will no longer be able to vote for abortion rights even if that's what they want. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=934.0s)]
*  I mean, look at it in terms of their high dollar candidates. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=947.0s)]
*  The guy polling second for the Republican nomination for president right now is hoping to coast to the White House on the popularity of him just signing a total ban on abortion [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=950.0s)]
*  and also instituting book bans and attacking Disney. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=959.0s)]
*  What, no puppies to kick? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=964.0s)]
*  The guy polling first for the Republican nomination for president was just indicted on 34 felonies and tomorrow's the day that the civil suit against him starts related to the rape claims. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=966.0s)]
*  And I mean, that's just like today. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=979.0s)]
*  A snapshot of how things are going with the Republican Party in their effort to win over the American people to the popularity of their ideas. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=983.0s)]
*  And it's kind of been like that for a while. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=992.0s)]
*  And in contrast, the conservative media business and the conservative movement, they have their act together when you compare them to the Republican Party. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=995.0s)]
*  They, for example, are very successful both at what they try to do and in pure business terms. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1006.0s)]
*  They are slick and they are powerful, at least they have been. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1012.0s)]
*  And they really are responsible for the success of the political right in this country in a way that I'm sorry you just cannot credit to the work of the Republican Party itself. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1016.0s)]
*  Because when the Republican Party, when Republican Party politicians are left to do their thing, look at what they do. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1024.0s)]
*  So now here's the question. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1030.0s)]
*  The conservative media right now today is in one of its periodic crises. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1033.0s)]
*  They just today have lopped off another another one of their episodically dominant figures who, for whatever reason, hasn't worked out. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1037.0s)]
*  But he really is one of a string of them. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1046.0s)]
*  There will be someone after him. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1049.0s)]
*  And the important question, aside from the gossip, is what is the political agenda? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1052.0s)]
*  And the important question, aside from the gossip and the business news and all that stuff, the important question for our country is about the success of that business, the success of that industry, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1057.0s)]
*  whether that remarkably successful industry as a whole is today at any risk of losing its jush, its power, its capacity, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1068.0s)]
*  importantly, to drag the Republican Party around in its wake, no matter how hapless that party is and remains. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1079.0s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1086.0s)]
*  Today, we got a striking set of letters from Fannie Willis. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1088.0s)]
*  You know that name. She is the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, who's investigating Trump and others for their alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1093.0s)]
*  Look at this. District Attorney Willis sent letters like this one to various law enforcement agencies in Fulton County today, basically giving them a heads up, telling them to be ready for possible indictments in this case this summer. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1106.0s)]
*  She says, quote, In the near future, I will announce charging decisions resulting from the investigation my office has been conducting into possible criminal interference in the administration of Georgia's 2020 general election. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1119.0s)]
*  I will be providing this letter to you to bring to your attention the need for heightened security and preparedness. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1131.0s)]
*  Quote, The announcement of decisions in this case may provoke a significant public reaction. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1137.0s)]
*  I will be announcing charging decisions resulting from this investigation during Fulton County Superior Court's fourth term of court, which will begin July 11th, 2023 and conclude on September 1st. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1142.0s)]
*  Please accept this correspondence as notice to allow you sufficient time to prepare the sheriff's office and coordinate with local, state and federal agencies to ensure that our law enforcement community is ready to protect the public. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1156.0s)]
*  So she's giving them a few weeks notice. As we understand it, this means that Fannie Willis intends to present her case to a grand jury and ask for indictments. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1170.0s)]
*  The grand jury will be sitting in Fulton County, she says, between July 11th and September 1st. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1180.0s)]
*  She thinks her charging decisions at that point may provoke a significant public reaction that local law enforcement needs this much lead time to plan for. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1185.0s)]
*  So she's talking about something that is still sort of a long way away, but also this is a very provocative warning. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1198.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6jk-W9iDM&t=1210.0s)]
