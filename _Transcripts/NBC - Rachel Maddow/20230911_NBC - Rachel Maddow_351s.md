Video Description: Rachel Maddow explains how Janet Protasiewicz was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in part because of her criticism of the state's pro-Republican gerrymandering, and how Republicans are already trying to overturn her significant election victory by impeaching her before she has had a chance to hear a single case before the court. Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin describes how the move is motivating outraged voters.

# Voter wrath flares as Wisconsin GOP tries to disregard election results
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE)
*  It's called the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a very forgettable name, sorry. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=3.12s)]
*  But it does something very simple. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=5.68s)]
*  They look at political maps from around the country, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=7.36s)]
*  district lines for Congress and state legislatures. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=9.6s)]
*  They look at the maps for how well the maps create competitive elections, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=12.24s)]
*  whether they give one side an unfair advantage over the other side. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=16.88s)]
*  They look at the maps for fairness, basically, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=20.16s)]
*  and then they give them a letter grade like the grades you get in school. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=22.16s)]
*  Well, in the great state of Wisconsin, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=25.36s)]
*  where the districts were drawn by the Republican legislature, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=27.2s)]
*  the state House maps get an F. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=30.16s)]
*  Same for the Wisconsin state Senate maps. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=34.08s)]
*  Those also get an F for failure. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=35.84s)]
*  The failure for Wisconsin democracy in those maps [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  translates into a win for Wisconsin Republicans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=44.24s)]
*  The bottom line with those maps is that even when way more people in Wisconsin [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=46.72s)]
*  vote for Democrats, Republicans win most of the seats anyway. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=50.64s)]
*  It's a nice trick. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=54.32s)]
*  Wisconsin voters appear to be just about fed up with this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=56.0s)]
*  Consider what happened this year when they voted for a new state Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=59.12s)]
*  Liberal candidate Janet Protasewicz told voters the Wisconsin maps are wrong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=63.92s)]
*  She called the maps rigged. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=69.36s)]
*  She said they do not reflect people in this state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=70.72s)]
*  Voters heard that message and they picked Janet Protasewicz [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=74.16s)]
*  by a margin of 11 points, a resounding margin. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=78.0s)]
*  Her victory created a liberal majority on the Wisconsin [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=82.24s)]
*  Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years with just a huge win. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=85.6s)]
*  And so Wisconsin Republicans freaked out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=92.08s)]
*  Before she hears a single case on the Supreme Court, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Republicans are threatening to impeach her. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=97.44s)]
*  They would need a majority vote in the House to impeach her. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  They have that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  They would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove her. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=104.08s)]
*  A two-thirds majority, which they also have. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=108.08s)]
*  Wisconsin Democrats are now launching a $4 million ad campaign to alert Wisconsin voters, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  a $4 million campaign to alert Wisconsin voters to what the Republicans are doing, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=117.6s)]
*  to what the Republican plan is for this new justice that the voters in the state just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=122.08s)]
*  elected by such a resounding margin. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=126.32s)]
*  The chair of the state Democratic Party told the national press this week, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=128.56s)]
*  quote, the longer they push this forward, the more political price we want to build [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=132.16s)]
*  for Republicans in the legislature and the whole GOP machinery. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  This could become a fireball that eats all of them up through 2024. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=140.88s)]
*  Joining us now is the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=146.24s)]
*  Mr. Wickler, it's nice to see you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=150.16s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=151.28s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=153.04s)]
*  The thing that I think is, even if you don't know anything about Wisconsin politics, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=155.28s)]
*  the thing that I think is shocking from the outside is the size of her victory in that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=159.6s)]
*  statewide election and then the immediate move to remove her anyway, even when she's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=164.72s)]
*  done anything as a judge. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=169.6s)]
*  How is this being viewed inside the state? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=171.04s)]
*  There's no more fundamental American value than the freedom to choose our own leaders. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=174.88s)]
*  So when Wisconsinites find out that a group of politicians led by Robin Voss, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=179.68s)]
*  the Republican speaker of our state assembly, are threatening to overturn the last election [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=183.84s)]
*  just to lock in their own power and prevent the public from choosing who leads the state, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=189.04s)]
*  they are outraged. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=194.24s)]
*  We've been flooded with calls, people have been calling us out, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  people are donating left and right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=199.2s)]
*  And more critically, they're calling Republicans in the state legislature [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=201.28s)]
*  to tell them not to do this, not to cross this line and throw out a race, a million votes [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  that took place just a few months ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  It is shocking. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  And this is a moment when everyone needs to weigh in to stop the GOP from essentially [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=215.12s)]
*  undermining the entire system of democracy in our state and creating a precedent that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  could spread across the country. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=225.44s)]
*  As I mentioned, Ben, the Republicans do on paper have the votes to do this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=227.12s)]
*  They certainly have a majority in the House and they have two-thirds in the Senate, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=233.36s)]
*  basically exactly as far as I understand it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=237.52s)]
*  What that means is they have the votes to do it, but with zero margin. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=240.0s)]
*  It means if there are any defectors from this plan, it won't work. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=243.28s)]
*  Are any Republicans visibly getting a little nervous or wobbly about this? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=246.8s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=251.84s)]
*  So now that the public is finding out about this plot, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=253.04s)]
*  at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, we set up a website at DefendJustice.com with a scorecard. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=256.16s)]
*  And if you go there, you'll see that we have our first Republican state representative who came [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  out publicly and said, no, he would vote against impeachment. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=267.12s)]
*  We have a few that have told constituents that they're against, although they haven't said so [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  publicly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=275.20000000000005s)]
*  And then we have a whole bunch that are saying nothing about their position. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=276.0s)]
*  Our sense is that they realize that this is a total political disaster for them, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  that even if they successfully impeached a Supreme Court justice to lock in their power, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=285.28s)]
*  which has never happened before in Wisconsin or anywhere else, there's never been a purely [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  political impeachment. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Even if they did that, voters would eventually have the final say. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=296.08s)]
*  So they need to step back from this brink. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  And frankly, what they're proposing is against the Wisconsin Constitution. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=302.32s)]
*  So they have a pretty good exit ramp. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=306.64s)]
*  They can just say they looked at it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=308.96s)]
*  It doesn't meet the standard that the Constitution sets out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=310.88s)]
*  They're done. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  If they don't do that, they're going to have to answer to voters for the rest of their [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=314.48s)]
*  political lives. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=318.0s)]
*  Ben Wickler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=318.88s)]
*  Ben, I know this is a very hard fought fight in your state right now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for keeping us apprised. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=327.36s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=328.8s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY6K5l9RkQE&t=344.48s)]
