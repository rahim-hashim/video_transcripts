# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 3
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo)
*  NBC News reporting tonight that the other main prosecution witness in the Trump criminal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=0.0s)]
*  trial, Michael Cohen, has since the verdict had his whole family doxxed. People have posted [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=5.8s)]
*  street addresses and other personally identifying information for his wife and for his children. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=11.68s)]
*  NBC News also reported that in the immediate wake of the verdict, pro-Trump message boards [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=18.6s)]
*  posted a high volume of violent threats toward both the prosecutor and the judge in the New [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=23.12s)]
*  York case, including what purported to be the home address of district attorney Alvin [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=28.18s)]
*  Bragg and what purported to be the addresses, the home addresses of some of the jurors from [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=32.74s)]
*  the case. This is what it's like for people who are part of the legal system when the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=37.22s)]
*  legal system is getting Donald Trump in trouble. And this is an ongoing thing. This is not [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  going away. There's lots of pending cases against Trump. And these threats and the harassment [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=49.3s)]
*  and intimidation of people who are involved in the legal system, people who are witnesses, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=55.339999999999996s)]
*  jurors, prosecutors, judges, court personnel. Trump, I mean, encourages it indirectly every [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=59.82s)]
*  time he makes individual people in these legal proceedings a personal target for his criticism [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=66.82s)]
*  and vitriol and often his lies. He's never, ever discouraged his supporters from mounting [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=71.62s)]
*  the kind of harassment and intimidation campaigns that they have against everyone involved in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=78.62s)]
*  these cases, including like the court clerks and the family members of the judges and the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=83.62s)]
*  witnesses themselves and their families too. And it's, it's, it's every time, right? It's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  not just this current case. Last summer, Trump supporters circulated the purported names and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=92.98s)]
*  photographs and home addresses of the grand jury, members of the grand jury in Fulton [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=98.22s)]
*  County, Georgia, after that grand jury voted to indict Trump there. This year, before Trump [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=103.62s)]
*  was convicted in March and April, Reuters counted at least 152 posts on three pro Trump [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=108.14s)]
*  websites urging the beating or killing of Judge Mershon or Judge Angorin in New York [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=114.46s)]
*  or Judge McAfee in Georgia. One January six convict who has already served his prison [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=120.38s)]
*  sentence for taking part in the Trump mob attack on Congress. He posted on Twitter, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  a photo of prosecutor Alvin Bragg and a noose. It is terrorizing to the people involved in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=132.74s)]
*  these cases and it is systemic. They do it to all of them with all of the cases. It's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  designed to make the legal system unworkable when it comes to Trump, right? It's designed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=147.06s)]
*  to make people unwilling to participate in the system if Trump is involved in the case [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=151.9s)]
*  because you and your family will be put in danger. It's designed if you are part of a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=156.82s)]
*  case involving Trump, if you are considering bringing some sort of legal action, however [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  well justified that relates to Trump, they want you to fear for your life and for the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=170.84s)]
*  lives of your family. That's the basic idea behind it, right? We're all supposed to be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=174.62s)]
*  so scared of what he'll do. We're supposed to be so scared of how crazy his supporters [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=179.64s)]
*  will go that to be safe we should just let him do whatever he wants. No matter what it is, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=184.34s)]
*  just let him get away with it because anything that annoys him, anything that holds him back, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=189.14s)]
*  anything that punishes him for what he's done, they'll get so mad and we should be so scared [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=193.14s)]
*  of what they'll do because oh, you wouldn't like them when they're mad. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=198.5s)]
*  Trump was asked this weekend about his potentially being sent to prison when he gets sentenced [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=204.7s)]
*  next month. He said this in response, he said, quote, I don't know that the public would [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=209.14s)]
*  stand for it. I'm not sure the public would stand for it. I think it would be tough for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=213.5s)]
*  the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there's a breaking point. He's saying [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=216.62s)]
*  you jail me, there'll be a breaking point. The public won't stand for it. Sounds like [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=222.14s)]
*  a threat, right? It is a threat. It's the same threat he always makes because he wants [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=226.06s)]
*  us all to feel threatened, but he makes the same threat all the time. All right, September [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=231.7s)]
*  2022, after the FBI served the search warrant at his home at Mar-a-Lago, he says, quote, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=237.26s)]
*  I don't know how much more our country will be willing to withstand. Two months later, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=243.38s)]
*  December 2022, all caps, the people of this country aren't going to take it much longer. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=250.38s)]
*  Then he was asked on a radio show about the possibility of him being criminally indicted. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=256.58s)]
*  He said, I think if it happened, I think you'd have problems in this country, the likes of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=260.06s)]
*  which we've never seen before. I don't think the people of the United States would stand [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=263.66s)]
*  for it. I think they'd have big problems, big problems. I just don't think they'd stand [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=267.82000000000005s)]
*  for it. Then in March 2023, he said if he was indicted, it would rain down death and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=270.82000000000005s)]
*  destruction. But he said would be, quote, catastrophic for our country, death and destruction [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=278.22s)]
*  if he were indicted. Then he was indicted. Then last summer, after after he was indicted, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=284.94000000000005s)]
*  he was asked about a possible prison sentence. He says, quote, I think it's a very dangerous [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=291.46s)]
*  thing to even talk about because we do have a tremendously passionate group of voters. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=295.78s)]
*  I think it would be very dangerous, very, very dangerous. So, yeah, now he's threatening [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  again that there's going to be catastrophic civil war level violence if anything bad happens [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=306.73999999999995s)]
*  to him, like an indictment, which has happened four times, like an arraignment, which has [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  happened multiple times, like a conviction, which has happened 34 times, like a potential [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=315.14s)]
*  prison sentence, which stay tuned at every step of the way. He has made the same threat [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=319.18s)]
*  at every step of the way. He has shaken his fist at the country and warned that if anything [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=327.5s)]
*  happens to him, his followers will rise up and level the place. Death and destruction [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  like nothing the country has ever seen before. It's always the same threat. It is not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=337.3s)]
*  actually what they do. Because it is not actually how the country feels. If you look at the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=342.62s)]
*  polling since the verdict in the New York case came down, there's been three national [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=348.74s)]
*  polls on reaction to the verdict so far. All of them show that most people in this country [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=352.62s)]
*  think the verdict was the right thing. The country is not rising up en masse to defend [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=357.02s)]
*  him. By and large, the country thinks he committed crimes and it makes sense that he was convicted [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=362.18s)]
*  of them. These threats that if anything happens to him in the legal system, the country won't [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=366.42s)]
*  stand for it and there will be mass violence and there will be blood in the streets and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=373.02s)]
*  there will be riots. You'll see it rising up like the country has never seen before. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=377.1s)]
*  That is not happening. What is happening is his followers are terrorizing individual people [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  involved in the legal process. And the Republican Party at the highest level and with almost [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  total uniformity is simultaneously telling the American people that the American legal [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=394.62s)]
*  system is bunk and they shouldn't respect it and they shouldn't trust it. And Republicans [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=399.06s)]
*  at the state level are not just tolerating and trying to get away with election crimes [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=403.22s)]
*  to help Trump. Criminal election subversion is now being celebrated and rewarded even [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=406.78s)]
*  in places where criminal prosecutions of these folks are ongoing. Places like Arizona and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=411.82s)]
*  Nevada, fake Trump electors are charged with felonies there. But the accused felons have [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=416.73999999999995s)]
*  also just been given big new jobs by the state Republican Party in those states. They've [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  been named delegates to the National Republican Convention and state representatives to the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=426.73999999999995s)]
*  Republican National Committee. They've done the same with one of the fake electors in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=431.18s)]
*  Wisconsin where Republicans are trying again to recall a state legislative leader who acted in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=435.06s)]
*  their mind with insufficient fervor to overthrow the election results in Wisconsin when Biden won [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=441.58s)]
*  that state and Trump lost. In Nevada, two of the state's official electors for the 2024 [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=447.66s)]
*  election will be people who are currently under indictment for what they did as fake [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=456.3s)]
*  electors in the last election. In the Republican Party right now, January 6th, defendants are [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=461.74s)]
*  hostages and heroes who will be fully and immediately pardoned. Fake electors will be new [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=469.26s)]
*  party leaders, brave souls who said no to the coup, who, you know, people who Democrats and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=473.58000000000004s)]
*  normal people briefly tried to lionize for their bravery, people like, you know, Vice President [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=479.74s)]
*  Mike Pence. They are roundly rejected by their party. While prosecutors and judges and witnesses [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=484.5s)]
*  and jurors are hounded and threatened daily. This is not something about which you can sort of put [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=493.9s)]
*  your head down and wait it out because these cases are going to go on and on. But we are in a moment [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=502.78s)]
*  where the burden of intimidation and harassment and threatened violence, the burden of what's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=509.42s)]
*  going on in the Trump movement is terroristic. It's not mass violence. The burden of what is [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=515.5s)]
*  being threatened against our fellow Americans is falling disproportionately on a very small [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=522.7s)]
*  number of people. It's falling on individual people. They are singling out to try to pick them off. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=529.4200000000001s)]
*  In order to intimidate the whole country, there isn't a civil war. There isn't a riot. I was [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=535.26s)]
*  promised there would be riots if Trump were convicted. There were no riots. There hasn't even [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=544.06s)]
*  been a good sized pro Trump protest anywhere in years. They are not using mass action. They are [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=547.38s)]
*  using targeted harassment and threats towards specific people to try to cow all of us, to make [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=554.5s)]
*  us all scared of anything that holds Trump to account and punishes him for committing crimes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=562.54s)]
*  The solution to that is not rocket science. It's not complex. It's a couple of things. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=569.62s)]
*  Fairly obviously, one, we vociferously defend more than we have been the people who are being [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=575.34s)]
*  intimidated and harassed and threatened, both because they deserve that as human beings, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=584.22s)]
*  but also because they are standing in for all of us. This small number of people is being attacked [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=588.3000000000001s)]
*  in order to make all of us afraid so that we as a country will change our behavior, so that we will, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=595.34s)]
*  in the words of Tim Snyder's book on tyranny, we will obey in advance. So we will cower and try to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=600.78s)]
*  make sure we only do things that make Trump happy because we're so scared of the response. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=607.1800000000001s)]
*  There are individual people who are bearing the brunt of terroristic intimidation [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=611.66s)]
*  by the pro-Trump movement that is designed not only to ruin those people's lives and get [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=617.8199999999999s)]
*  retribution against them, but to scare all of us that it could happen to any of us. It could happen [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  to all of us. If we don't stand up for those people, that will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=627.18s)]
*  So that's one. Stand up for those people and protect those people better than we have been. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=634.14s)]
*  Recognize that they are small in number and they can all be protected. That's one. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=638.2199999999999s)]
*  Second, don't cower, right? If that means there are going to be yet more federal charges brought, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=643.9s)]
*  and there might be, we should not cower about the prospect that Trump and his supporters will get [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=652.78s)]
*  mad if Trump is held to account. Yes, they'll be mad. That's their problem. More federal charges [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=658.06s)]
*  may yet be brought if that is where that investigation leads. If so, so be it. There's [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=663.42s)]
*  so be it. There's no reason anybody should shy away from that. More state charges may yet be [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=668.46s)]
*  brought. There are open investigations, not just in Michigan, but in some of the other states [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=674.22s)]
*  where they have pronounced Trump, for example, to be an unindicted co-conspirator. They have also [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=679.1s)]
*  said the investigation is ongoing. In more states, there may yet be more state charges. If so, if that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=682.9399999999999s)]

*  We are at a moment when the Republican Party says the legal system doesn't work. The criminals are [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=694.06s)]
*  the heroes. Everybody involved in making the legal system work should fear for their lives. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=699.26s)]
*  Trump says the country will rain down fire if he faces any more legal consequences. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=705.26s)]
*  The Republican Party is wrong about that, and Trump is wrong about that. Our system is strong, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=710.06s)]
*  and so we should feel very confident in standing up to protect it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=717.5s)]
*  And so we should feel very confident in standing up to protect it. Our system is strong, and so are we. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=720.7s)]
*  That was outside the Michigan State Capitol December 2020. That scene ultimately led to [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=742.94s)]
*  the indictment of 16 alleged fake electors for Donald Trump in Michigan. It led more recently to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=747.58s)]
*  testimony in a Michigan state courtroom on Friday. This past Friday, as reported in the Detroit News, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=753.98s)]
*  that same officer who turned the fake electors away at the door to the state Capitol, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=760.22s)]

*  the Federal Bureau of Investigation and two U.S. prosecutors from Washington, D.C. Thursday, of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=770.7s)]

*  learned that the state investigation in Michigan might not have reached its conclusion yet either. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=799.9s)]
*  A state investigator telling the court that the Michigan attorney general's office still has [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=804.86s)]
*  outstanding subpoenas and search warrants as part of what he described as an ongoing state [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=808.86s)]
*  investigation into the Michigan fake electors. He told the court, quote, it's still an open investigation. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  He also told the court at one point that investigators were treating the Michigan [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=821.1s)]
*  state Republican Party headquarters as a, quote, crime scene. Joining us now is Craig Mauger. He's [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=825.1800000000001s)]
*  politics reporter for the Detroit News. He's been reporting on the fake elector news out of Michigan. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=832.22s)]
*  Mr. Mauger, thank you very much for being here. Appreciate you joining us. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=836.7s)]
*  Hey, thanks so much for having me. So this is a sort of sprawling case. There's 16 defendants [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=839.98s)]
*  and there's been a lot of court proceedings already, not for all of them, but for most of them [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=847.02s)]
*  that are essentially designed to decide whether or not these charges are going to go ahead. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=853.82s)]
*  It's a long process. It's a somewhat complex process given the number of defendants. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=860.94s)]
*  What do you feel like have been the major revelations from the court proceedings that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=865.9s)]
*  you've covered so closely thus far? I think you've hit on a couple of them tonight, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=868.78s)]
*  that this is very much an ongoing probe. The attorney general staff is trying to figure out [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=873.58s)]
*  what the guidance was that was provided to these 16 electors whose signatures ended up on this [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=878.5400000000001s)]
*  certificate, falsely claiming that Donald Trump had won Michigan's 16 electoral votes. This [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=884.94s)]
*  investigation is ongoing. There's some element of a federal probe that's looking at this as well [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=890.94s)]
*  that seems very much ongoing, as you mentioned. The key thing here is the attorney general's office [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=896.22s)]
*  has to prove as part of this case to be successful that these individuals had an intent to defraud [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=902.22s)]
*  the public. The question is, did these individuals have that intent or was someone essentially [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=909.26s)]
*  fooling them into signing this document, not letting them know what the true purpose of the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=916.7s)]
*  document was, and then turning around, taking their signatures, and doing something different [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=921.42s)]
*  than what they had told them they were going to do? That's the crux of all of this. If it's not [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=926.38s)]
*  their intent to defraud, if it's someone else's, the question is, whose was that and why have they [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=931.34s)]
*  not been charged so far? Right. And to have the state prosecutors in Michigan, the investigators, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=936.62s)]
*  say, we've got these 16 defendants, but here's another 11 people who are unindicted co-conspirators, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=944.3s)]
*  including the former president, including his top lawyer. I mean, it really, they are painting a [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=950.3s)]
*  sprawling picture, but the charges haven't necessarily followed all of the allegations. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=955.82s)]
*  At this point, that's, Craig, part of the reason I wanted to talk to you is that I was [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  really surprised by this revelation that you reported in court on Friday that there does [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=964.62s)]
*  appear to be an ongoing federal investigation here, a federal investigation on top of what's [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=969.34s)]
*  going on with the state. Do you have any sense from what's been disclosed in court, what the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=974.7s)]
*  contours might be of that federal investigation? Well, the police captain who revealed this, and [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=978.78s)]
*  everyone in the courtroom was surprised by this. The defense attorneys were surprised. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=985.1s)]
*  Even the judge kind of used the word surprise to talk about this statement that was made by [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=988.94s)]
*  the Michigan police captain. All of a sudden kind of out of the blue is kind of a traditional line [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=995.0200000000001s)]
*  of questioning. Who else have you talked to? And this police captain says, Oh, I talked to some [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1000.1400000000001s)]
*  people yesterday from Washington, D.C. Everyone kind of froze for a second. What do you mean you [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1004.22s)]
*  talked to someone from Washington, D.C. yesterday? He said that this interview focused wholly on the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1008.86s)]
*  electors. This was about the electors. This wasn't some other issue. This was an interview [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1014.46s)]
*  that lasted some amount of time talking about these fake electoral votes that these people [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1019.26s)]
*  brought to the doorstep of the Michigan Capitol on December 14th, 2020. He said that they didn't ask [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1025.26s)]
*  about specific individuals. He read a list of some names. Did they ask about this person? He said, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1031.82s)]
*  no, it must have been from what I could tell from his testimony, it must have been kind of overall [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1038.7s)]
*  what happened when you were at the doorstep. These people came to the door. You answered, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1044.8600000000001s)]
*  what happened? And it was FBI, FBI personnel and federal prosecutors. And it's now that they're [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1048.8600000000001s)]
*  asking him these questions. Wow. It's amazing. It's very important to keep your old tape. When [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1057.18s)]
*  you play tape of something that happens, hold onto it for longer than you hold onto your tax records, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1062.8600000000001s)]
*  because you never know when the FBI will finally follow up on the crime that you aired on your TV [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1067.34s)]
*  show. Craig Mauger, you've really helped us and the whole country follow the nitty gritty of these [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1072.6999999999998s)]
*  stories as they've unfolded. And they seem to be unfolding in more and more important ways. So [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1078.6999999999998s)]
*  we're really grateful for you. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Craig Mauger, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1083.98s)]
*  politics reporter for the Detroit News. All right. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwv9cSGGCo&t=1088.54s)]
