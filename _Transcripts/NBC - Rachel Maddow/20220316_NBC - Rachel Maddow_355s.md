# Ukraine Emphasizes Higher Stakes For The World In Appeal For Aid In Fighting Russia's War
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c)
*  I want to bring into the conversation Mariana Zablotsky, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Zablotsky, thank you so much for joining us, particularly at this hour. It's the middle of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=4.4s)]
*  night. But I do want to get your reaction to President Biden's announcement after President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=8.8s)]
*  Zelensky's presentation to Congress that he is sending more military aid to Ukraine, more anti-tank [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=14.24s)]
*  aircraft, more anti-aircraft, I'm sorry, more anti-tank weapons and more anti-aircraft weapons, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  more armed drones. Is this going to help you? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=25.84s)]
*  This is extremely welcomed and we are extremely grateful to American people, to President Biden, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=32.64s)]
*  to American taxpayers for supporting us. We understand that United States have the wrong [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  problems and $14 billion of aid to Ukraine still matter a lot in the United States. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=43.84s)]
*  But here they will go the extreme way. They will alleviate suffering and this will actually help [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=50.32s)]
*  fight one of supposedly the biggest armies of the world, which is now severely demotivated. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=56.32s)]
*  And of course, President Zelensky is right to call to United States as the only country that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  can lead the free world and stop for the global rules written down after the World War II from [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=69.04s)]
*  changing. So after the World War II, everybody thought that changing borders by force is the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=75.28s)]
*  thing of the past. Now this crazy man in Kremlin tries to change that. And we are at the front [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=80.56s)]
*  line of this. This has to be stopped now. So this is not only the fight about Ukraine. This is a [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  fight about values. And we do ask for the American people and for President Biden to lead that fight. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=90.8s)]
*  What more do you have to say to the world when they say to you, as Cal Perry just reported, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=97.6s)]
*  that you are making that argument, that you're the front line of democracy, you're the front [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=103.12s)]
*  line against Russian imperialism, you're the front line against rules that we all agreed many, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=107.92s)]
*  many years ago we don't break about changing borders. Why do you feel that the West is not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=114.0s)]
*  completely embracing that and saying this is the war and we need to get into it? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that the West has done quite a lot already. And it's very difficult for me to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=125.04s)]
*  criticize any country for not doing enough. But I just need to say that we need to do the maximum. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=129.76s)]
*  So here's the thing. There are a lot of dictators around the world, a lot of countries without [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=134.72s)]
*  democracies. And currently every single one of them is watching what is the cost of actually [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=140.24s)]
*  trying to challenge the rules. What are the costs for invading other country and how will I be [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=146.32s)]
*  punished for that? There needs to be set a precedent that the costs are all the maximum potential [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=151.68s)]
*  consequences that all the countries can do on their behalf. So we cannot return to the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=157.92s)]
*  pre-World War II world where one country attacked other country and then they tried to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=164.16s)]
*  read some sort of agreement about the changes in territory. Because otherwise the world will turn [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=170.0s)]
*  into chaos and we will step right into World War III one way or another. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=175.84s)]
*  However, there are negotiations that stop and start between Russia and Ukraine and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=184.4s)]
*  negotiations mean a deal. How do you feel about the idea that Ukraine may end up making some [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=191.52s)]
*  concessions in order to get peace in the face of an unprovoked invasion of your country? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=198.0s)]
*  Well, it's very difficult to understand what will Putin end up agreeing to and what he can agree to. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=203.76s)]
*  What we understand now that his plan to reach some sort of agreement was non-existent before [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=210.88s)]
*  the war. He was absolutely 100% invested to his idea that he will win the country over [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=216.4s)]
*  the course of days, several weeks. And by now in his mind, the country should have already been [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=223.12s)]
*  conquered and there was no one to negotiate with. How soon can he come to a reality that he actually [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=229.12s)]
*  needs to come to a table? He should admit that his plans have failed already, that he cannot [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  reach what he wants with the military needs is a debatable question. The question is to his [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=242.24s)]
*  mentality and how adequate he is. So I just think we will have to wait and see for that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=246.72s)]
*  Let me ask you about the reports, these very disturbing reports about the attacks, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=254.0s)]
*  the continued attacks on civilian infrastructure, including this theater in Mariupol in which [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=258.24s)]
*  it is believed that there are people taking shelter. Do you think this changes the argument? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=263.92s)]
*  Do you think this changes the willingness of the world to get involved in a different way when they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=268.48s)]
*  continue to see these humanitarian, what might end up being war crimes? Of course, and it changes [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=272.8s)]
*  the attitude of Ukrainian people as well. What you see on the ground is actually even much worse than [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=280.56s)]
*  what you can see in the video. I just returned from Kiev a day ago and I listened to a lot of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=287.68s)]
*  stories from our members of parliament who helped people get out from the worst affected areas. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=293.76s)]
*  And when you do hear the stories about how refugees, those people who escaped fighting, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=298.88s)]
*  are talking about actual violence, the rape, systematic rape, the murder of civilians, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=304.88s)]
*  it's absolutely heartbreaking. So it's one thing even in the video that Zelensky presented to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=312.0s)]
*  watch how people are being and children treated at the hospitals. Another thing is to hear the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=318.56s)]
*  stories of violence and civilians of violence. It's actually even much worse than that. And [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=323.6s)]
*  this is something that Ukrainian nation will never forgive and will never forget for generations to come. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=329.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_imb2XT6c&t=348.56s)]
