# Trump Rejected His Presidential Duty Amid January 6th Crisis, Hearing Evidence Shows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA)
*  The thing that struck me the most about tonight, and I think we forget this, Rachel, I think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=0.0s)]
*  we don't emphasize it often enough. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=5.4s)]
*  Donald Trump is a man who has embraced immoral lying all of his life. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=8.2s)]
*  He has been a liar throughout his adult life, in every aspect of his life, whether it's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=16.2s)]
*  adultery or whether it's his business practices. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=23.68s)]
*  He came into the White House seeing lying as an important part of his job, that he could [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=27.34s)]
*  lie about things and get away with it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=34.18s)]
*  And what is stunning about tonight is that his daughter said he was lying. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=36.66s)]
*  His attorney general said he was lying. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=43.3s)]
*  The people who replaced his attorney general said he was lying. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=46.74s)]
*  Homeland Security said he was lying. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  All of these people said he was lying. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  And like rats off a sinking ship, they ran for the hills. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=54.84s)]
*  And then he just got immoral people around him and thought he could get away with the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  ultimate lie of all. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=64.08s)]
*  This is a liar. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=66.2s)]
*  And the sad thing is that he's fooled so many people in this country and that we're at this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=68.22s)]
*  place where he's actually considered a viable candidate to lead this country again. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=73.16s)]
*  It's astounding. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  Claire, one of the things that I found myself thinking about tonight, maybe I should have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  thought about this sooner, is there being sort of two levels of risk with having somebody [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=83.18s)]
*  who's willing to use the presidency for personal aims or for inappropriate aims, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  That the powers of the presidency are immense and the esteem of the job is eminently soilable [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=95.26s)]
*  in terms of what we need a U.S. presidency for in the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=102.84s)]
*  And so to have somebody who wants to use the presidency for bad ends is a dangerous thing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  There's a different kind of danger, though, which is that when the country needs a president, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=110.42s)]
*  to have somebody who will not do what a president needs to do to defend the country, to defend [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=115.18s)]
*  the Constitution, to defend our system of government, to have somebody who not only [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=120.36s)]
*  is a bad actor, but who cannot or will not do what only a president can do in moments [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=124.88s)]
*  of national security, violent crisis. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=132.08s)]
*  That is a different kind of risk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=135.76s)]
*  That's a different kind of harm that could be done. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=138.14s)]
*  And Liz Cheney talked about that tonight in a way that put evidence together in a way [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=140.05999999999997s)]
*  that we haven't heard before. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=144.61999999999998s)]
*  And I just wanted to get your reaction to that tonight. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=145.61999999999998s)]
*  You will hear that leaders on Capitol Hill begged the president for help, including Republican [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  leader McCarthy, who was, quote, scared and called multiple members of President Trump's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  family after he could not persuade the president himself. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=166.2s)]
*  call to any element of the United States government to instruct that the Capitol be defended. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=171.72s)]
*  He did not call his secretary of defense on January 6th. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=178.28s)]
*  He did not talk to his attorney general. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=181.92s)]
*  He did not talk to the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=184.16s)]
*  President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=187.88s)]
*  And he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=191.86s)]
*  assets. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=198.02s)]
*  The president took no action to defend the U.S. Capitol that day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=199.02s)]
*  And we can talk about his motive for that in terms of whether or not this was the intentional [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=203.62s)]
*  violence that he set out to create and was therefore enjoying it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  But once that once the country was at that level of threat, Vice President Pence tried [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=210.66000000000003s)]
*  to call in all of those assets to defend the country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=215.9s)]
*  The president made no call for any of them to do anything to stop the harm. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=220.26s)]
*  Does that resonate in a new way today after this hearing? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=225.98s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=229.7s)]
*  I think Americans, as partisan as we are right now, we saw it with Ukraine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=230.7s)]
*  There is still a desire that at moments of crisis, we want a president to bring us together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=237.06s)]
*  We really do. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  A moment of crisis, and I can picture Trump, because I know exactly that dining room. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=245.86s)]
*  I know exactly how he was sitting there watching a bank of television screens. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=250.74s)]
*  He watched them break those windows. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=256.54s)]
*  He watched them attack police officers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=259.48s)]
*  This was the president of the United States watching Capitol police officers be attacked [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=263.98s)]
*  and violence and someone being shot. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=270.3s)]
*  He thinks it's a good thing for him. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=273.54s)]
*  He sees the world only through what he can get and what he can have and how good he looks. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't care about anything else. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=284.22s)]
*  And that's the sad thing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=286.06s)]
*  All these people think he cares about them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=287.06s)]
*  He doesn't care about them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=288.74s)]
*  He's a liar. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  He's immoral. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=291.86s)]
*  And he refuses to lead a nation that desperately needed him to step up that day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=293.62s)]
*  I thought it was really powerful the way she put it that day. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  And I don't ever recall hearing that he never talked to anyone. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=302.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=307.5s)]
*  I think we had intimations to that effect. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=308.5s)]
*  We had the worrying hole in the White House call records, all these hours where we didn't [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=310.18s)]
*  know what happened. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  But hearing her definitively say he placed no call to any element of the U.S. government [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  to defend the U.S. Capitol, that is nuclear. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=319.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Ao0XJsftA&t=323.02000000000004s)]
