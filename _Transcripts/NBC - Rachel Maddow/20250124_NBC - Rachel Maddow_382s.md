# McConnell vote against Hegseth, defying Trump, raises eyebrows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY)
*  All right, Julie, if you'd stand by, we've got Senator Tammy Duckworth joining us to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=0.0s)]
*  talk about what she's saying and what she understands about this process thus far. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=4.12s)]
*  Senator Duckworth, I really appreciate you being here as a member of the Armed Services [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=8.68s)]
*  Committee and a senator voting tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=11.44s)]
*  What's your understanding of the state of play? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=13.48s)]
*  Well, I think the vote is cooked. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=15.52s)]
*  Basically, this is not John McCain's Republican Party anymore. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  This isn't Mitt Romney's Republican Party anymore. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=23.54s)]
*  The folks who have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump are gone. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=26.8s)]
*  And even those who have real concerns are not willing to jeopardize their own political [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=32.28s)]
*  survival and are willing to jeopardize our nation's national security. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=36.96s)]
*  And it's really sad to be here watching this vote happen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=41.92s)]
*  I just cast my no vote on the floor. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=44.96s)]
*  You know, and I voted for both of Trump's previous Secretary of Defense nominees in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=48.32s)]
*  his previous term. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=52.88s)]
*  But they were qualified to do the job, and Pete Hegseth is by far unqualified to do this [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=54.32s)]
*  job and they're just falling in line for him. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=59.96s)]
*  We've never had a defense secretary confirmed in terms like this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=63.84s)]
*  Depending on what happens with the final vote, it looks like Mr. Hegseth will be confirmed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=70.24s)]
*  either with 50 or 51 votes in the modern era. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Actually, in history, the closest we've ever had to something like that was Chuck Hagel [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=79.8s)]
*  in 2013, who was chosen by President Barack Obama to lead the Pentagon. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=85.52s)]
*  That was considered to be an unusually close vote. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=89.12s)]
*  He got 58 votes, including multiple Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  This is a 50 or 51 vote margin. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're used to defense secretaries being confirmed on voice votes, or in Leon [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=100.0s)]
*  Panetta's case, at a 100 to 0 kind of vote. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=104.44s)]
*  What do you think it means for the Pentagon to have somebody come in as their leader with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=108.32s)]
*  this little support and this controversial and accused of all the things that Mr. Hegseth [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  has struggled to parry during this process? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, it means very much instability in the Pentagon. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=123.24s)]
*  Remember that during the confirmation hearing, Mr. Hegseth would not step away when he was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=130.2s)]
*  asked from the question. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=136.64s)]
*  When he was asked, Donald Trump says he wants to come in and fire all the generals, all [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=138.11999999999998s)]
*  the people with experience. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=142.64s)]
*  Would you oppose him? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  He wouldn't say that he would oppose Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=145.64s)]
*  He was asked by Elise Slotkin, Senator Slotkin, if he would oppose Donald Trump, if Donald [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=147.92s)]
*  Trump told him to order military men and women to shoot peaceful protesters in the legs, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  which is what Donald Trump tried to do the first time around. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=161.64s)]
*  And Pete Hegseth wouldn't say no to wouldn't say that he would oppose Donald Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  This is a man that is not going to say no to Donald Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=168.68s)]
*  The Pentagon has absolutely have to be just horrified right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know what else is unprecedented, Rachel, the fact that he never met with a single Democrat [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  on the Armed Services Committee prior to his confirmation hearing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  I still have not met with him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=183.72000000000003s)]
*  And they've kept him and hidden him away from us because they know how supremely unqualified [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=185.96s)]
*  he is for this job. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=190.24s)]
*  While we've been speaking, Senator Duckworth, we've just had word that Senator Mitch McConnell, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=192.16s)]
*  former Republican Senate leader, has just cast his vote on the nomination and he was [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=195.88s)]
*  a no vote. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=200.56s)]
*  So Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins, they had voted no on the procedural vote that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=202.0s)]
*  effectively got us to this vote tonight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=208.3s)]
*  And so that was a strong signal that they would be a no vote on the substance in tonight's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=210.0s)]
*  final vote. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=213.96s)]
*  We did not know that Senator Mitch McConnell would also vote no. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=214.96s)]
*  Can I get your reaction to that? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm very much pleased to know that there's at least three Republicans who will put the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=219.8s)]
*  well-being of our nation above themselves, which is really what our oath of office was [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=223.52s)]
*  about. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  I doubt that there will be another Republican who will cast a no vote. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  I was there in the room when John McCain came in and went thumbs down and saved the ACA. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=233.72000000000003s)]
*  So maybe there's one more person in the Republican Party who has some courage to stand up to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=237.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=241.52s)]
*  But remember that those who express even the slightest concern about Pete Hexseth came [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=242.52s)]
*  under just a torrent, a deluge, a flood of attacks from the MAGA base. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=248.3s)]
*  Joni Ernst received so many threats and attacks, outright threatening her, saying that they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=254.34s)]
*  would primary her all the way through to threats against her own security. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=262.5s)]
*  Pete Hexseth's second wife lives in fear. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=267.74s)]
*  She has young children. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=271.82s)]
*  She, as you've mentioned, she's under an NDA. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=272.82s)]
*  She had to have a safe word because she was so afraid of him. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=275.82s)]
*  You talk to sexual assault survivors, domestic violence survivors, they are terrified and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  they're not going to speak out against their abusers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  And so here we are now at a place where we have a Secretary of Defense who is accused [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  of these terrible, terrible domestic violence issues, is accused of having very low moral [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=297.02s)]
*  character. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=303.86s)]
*  You know, described as being drunk, so drunk that he passed out in uniform in a strip club [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  and has had no experience running an organization of any size near the size of the Pentagon. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=310.98s)]
*  In fact, the last company that he ran, a not-for-profit he ran, he so badly bungled their finances [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  they had to bring in a forensic accountant to figure out what he did with the $10 million [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=321.74s)]
*  budget. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=325.18s)]
*  And now they're going to put him in charge of a $900 billion Pentagon budget. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=326.18s)]
*  It's a sad day for our nation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=330.38s)]
*  I fear for the military. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=331.66s)]
*  I fear for our national security. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=333.26s)]
*  I hope that at least another Republican steps forward. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=335.06s)]
*  But you know, I have hopes, but I doubt that we're going to see that happen today, unfortunately. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=337.42s)]
*  You have hopes, but you also have eyes and ears to follow what is happening and how they've [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  treated this nomination thus far. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=351.18s)]
*  Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth, Iraq combat veteran, thank you so much for making time [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=353.14s)]
*  tonight as this vote is still underway. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=358.06s)]
*  I really appreciate it, Senator. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=359.38s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Meadow. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjemNsQsCdY&t=361.26s)]
