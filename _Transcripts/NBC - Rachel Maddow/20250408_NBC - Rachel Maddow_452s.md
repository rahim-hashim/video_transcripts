Video Description: Rachel Maddow calls out the stupidity of Donald Trump's system for governing, which appears to be to break everything in government and then only repair the damage to things that cause the greatest public outcry. Under Trump's system, the people least able to speak out, like the elderly, are the least likely to have their demands addressed.

# Maddow blasts Trump's 'terrible, absolutely ridiculous way to run a government'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk)
*  We even today had news that Trump's truly inexplicable, even bizarre cuts at a refuge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=0.0s)]
*  for Florida manatees. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=8.22s)]
*  That has now been reversed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=10.96s)]
*  Trump fired the Rangers at this manatee refuge, but now, quote, after public outcry and two [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=12.76s)]
*  court orders, the Rangers are back on the job. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=18.5s)]
*  This is such a stupid way to run a government, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=21.84s)]
*  Some individual disasters manage somehow to get enough attention to often get protested, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=26.52s)]
*  and then the Trump people find they can't really defend them, and so those things then [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=34.04s)]
*  get partially restored or maybe not really restored, but they say they'll fix them, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=37.8s)]
*  and they hope people stop complaining. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=41.96s)]
*  But meanwhile, while people are scrambling to try to fix that mistake they made, these [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=44.08s)]
*  guys are destroying 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 other things all the time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=48.08s)]
*  It is a terrible, absolutely ridiculous way to run a government, especially under the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=53.12s)]
*  name of efficiency, right? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=58.64s)]
*  I mean, how can it be that the reason we still have people on the job today storing and transporting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  our nuclear weapons is not because Donald Trump didn't fire them, because he did, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=67.72s)]
*  but only because, just our luck, the right people found out that he had fired them and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=72.4s)]
*  made a big enough ruckus about it in time so some of them could be hired back? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  That is the reason we now have people on the job keeping our nuclear weapons from prematurely [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=81.1s)]
*  exploding. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=86.3s)]
*  That's the system now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=87.3s)]
*  That's how we're running it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=88.66s)]
*  And it's incredibly stupid, but the big, big, big, big, big problem with that being [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=92.3s)]
*  our system right now is that for some problems, the people who are most affected and most [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  hurt by it are the people who can least make a ruckus, the people who have the least opportunity [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=104.58s)]
*  to see what's wrong, complain about it in a way that is big enough that it's going [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=110.18s)]
*  to get noticed and their complaints are going to be taken seriously, and so somebody's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=115.54s)]
*  going to do something about it and maybe it'll get reversed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=120.3s)]
*  The people who are going to be hurt the most grievously are the people who are least capable [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=122.9s)]
*  of raising a ruckus about what's being done to them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=127.56s)]
*  And so here we are, headline, Washington Post. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=131.78s)]
*  The social security website keeps crashing as Doge demands cuts to IT staff. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=135.82s)]
*  Retirees and disabled people are facing chronic website outages and other access problems [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=139.82s)]
*  as they attempt to log into their online social security accounts. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=144.62s)]
*  The website has crashed repeatedly in recent weeks with outages lasting anywhere from 20 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  minutes to almost a day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  Even when the site is back online, many customers have not been able to sign into their accounts [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=153.66s)]
*  or have logged in only to find information missing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=158.06s)]
*  The disruptions are occurring as Trump's acting social security chief and the Doge [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=161.06s)]
*  team move to lay off large swaths of the workforce. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=164.78s)]
*  Thousands of social security employees have already been pushed out, many in customer [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=168.58s)]
*  facing roles, others with expertise in the agency's technology systems. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=172.9s)]
*  The network outages are one in a cascade of blows to customer service that also have hobbled [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=177.58s)]
*  phone systems and field office operations as the workforce shrinks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=182.62s)]
*  The network crashes, specifically, appear to be caused by an expansion initiated by [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=187.86s)]
*  the Trump team. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=192.74s)]
*  The Trump technology staff did not test the software against a high volume of users to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=194.06s)]
*  see if the servers could handle a rush. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=199.94000000000003s)]
*  Connectivity issues and bugs with the expanded system have caused the portal that manages [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  logins and authentication for many social security applications to go down. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=207.18s)]
*  That's the Washington Post. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=213.3s)]
*  Here's the headline in the New York Times. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=214.5s)]
*  Quote, just a mess. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=216.34s)]
*  Staff cuts, rushed changes and anxiety at social security. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=218.42s)]
*  President Trump promised not to touch social security, but as Elon Musk's team trims staff [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=223.54s)]
*  and plans, trims, that's doing a lot of work there, trims staff and plans cuts to phone [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=228.06s)]
*  services, the system is groaning under the pressure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Here's the lead. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  Quote, the line started forming outside the social security office in suburban Glendale, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  not long after sunrise. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=243.7s)]
*  Dozens of retirees and people with disabilities shuffling papers, some leaning on walkers, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=247.1s)]
*  all anxious to know whether Trump's government overhaul had put their safety nets at risk. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=251.42s)]
*  When 9 a.m. came, an employee emerged from the building with flyers, asking the crowd [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=255.66s)]
*  to come back once they had scheduled an appointment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=260.02s)]
*  One woman yelled, I've called for days. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=262.52s)]
*  Another said, we came from a long ways away. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=266.18s)]
*  Another let everyone know they had been handed a load of bunk, though she used a more colorful [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=269.58s)]
*  term. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  Quote, on April 14th, the social security agency plans to largely phase out phone services [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  for people filing for retirement and survivor benefits or changing their direct deposit [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=281.5s)]
*  information, forcing them to file online or come into the office. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=285.18s)]
*  Staffing levels at the social security administration were already at 50-year lows, and the departure [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=289.62s)]
*  of so many workers who answered phones and work field office counters has led to longer [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=294.52s)]
*  lines and phone waits. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=298.9s)]
*  Teresa Boswell, whose vote for Mr. Trump in November helped flip Arizona, but who found [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  herself fuming outside the Social Security office in Glendale last week, unable to sign [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  up for $1,200 in monthly benefits after she retired from her job processing legal papers, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=311.84s)]
*  told the Times, quote, I didn't know he was going to pull this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=317.17999999999995s)]
*  She told the Times, quote, this is a joke. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=321.85999999999996s)]
*  It's not a joke. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  It's the destruction of one of the core moral and practical functions of the United [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=328.62s)]
*  States government that affects elderly and disabled people who are among the least able [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=333.1s)]
*  to raise a relevant ruckus when things go wrong that hurt them grievously. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=338.5s)]
*  And the Trump administration's approach to handling this crisis is to just hope that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=343.86s)]
*  people don't hear about it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=348.24s)]
*  From the New York Times, quote, the White House has grown worried enough about the political [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=351.0s)]
*  fallout from the long lines and wait times that White House officials are pressuring [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=354.26s)]
*  Social Security administrators to reduce the information that they put online, which [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=358.44s)]
*  could draw attention to problems. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=364.26s)]
*  Yeah, we wouldn't want to draw any attention to these problems. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Tonight we are going to speak with the Attorney General of the state of Arizona. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=373.36s)]
*  She's a Democrat. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=376.8s)]
*  Her name is Chris Mays. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=377.8s)]
*  And at least for the state of Arizona, her office has created a website. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=378.8s)]
*  It's an easy to use one page website. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=383.2s)]
*  I spent some time on it today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=385.92s)]
*  This is it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=388.16s)]
*  This is the whole page. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=389.16s)]
*  This is what it looks like. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=390.16s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=391.16s)]
*  And the reason they put up this webpage is for people in Arizona, if they're having [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=392.16s)]
*  trouble with Social Security because of what Trump is doing to it, they can use this website [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=396.76s)]
*  to report it to her office, to report it to their own state attorney general's office. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=401.32s)]
*  So number one, the attorney general's office can document what the problems are. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=406.44s)]
*  Number two, they can hopefully offer some help. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=410.88s)]
*  And number three, you know what maybe is the most important thing here? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=413.88s)]
*  They can, by doing this, implicitly tell older and disabled people and their families that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=418.96s)]
*  they do not have to be alone in contending with this. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  Because who else is telling them that? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_4k7di1EZk&t=429.09999999999997s)]
