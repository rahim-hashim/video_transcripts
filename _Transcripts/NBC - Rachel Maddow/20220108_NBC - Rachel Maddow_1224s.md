# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 7
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM)
*  There are two words I really didn't want to keep saying in 2022, but here we are. Cyber [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=0.0s)]
*  ninjas. You may recall that last year, pro-Trump elected officials in Arizona hired a small cyber [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=7.68s)]
*  security firm called the Cyber Ninjas to conduct a so-called audit of Maricopa County's 2020 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=13.52s)]
*  presidential election. Even though the audit turned out to be complete bullpucky, it's worth [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=19.44s)]
*  noting that due to the nature of their work, the Cyber Ninjas were subject to public records [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=25.36s)]
*  requests. Back in June, the Arizona Republic sued for those records and the Cyber Ninjas were [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=29.76s)]
*  told to turn over the documents. But to this day, the Cyber Ninjas have not complied. Given that, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=34.72s)]
*  the paper asked the judge overseeing the case to fine the Cyber Ninjas a thousand bucks a day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=41.52s)]
*  Yesterday, the judge says he doesn't think a thousand dollars a day would do any good. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=47.44s)]
*  Maricopa Superior Court Judge John Hannah ruled that the company's noncompliance was worth 50 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=52.16s)]
*  times that amount. He wants the company to pay $50,000 a day, saying he issued that ruling to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=58.8s)]
*  quote, put Cyber Ninjas on notice. And appears the company took notice. In a text message to NBC [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=65.76s)]
*  News, a company spokesperson said, quote, Cyber Ninjas is shutting down. All employees have been [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  let go. But if that is an attempt to avoid financial damages, like say the $50,000 a day [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=78.16s)]
*  for refusing to turn over documents, the company might be out of luck. Yesterday, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=84.24s)]
*  the judge explicitly warned that he would issue orders against the individuals responsible [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  for providing those records should the company refuse to turn them over. Judge Hannah said, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  quote, the court is not going to accept the assertion that Cyber Ninjas is an empty shell [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=101.12s)]
*  and that no one is responsible for seeing that it complies. Those fines will begin accruing today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=106.8s)]
*  The clock is officially ticking. The contractors, formerly known as Cyber Ninjas, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=113.44s)]
*  can either be transparent and deliver whatever records are outstanding or they can pay up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  I wonder which door they will choose. As Rachel would say, watch this space. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=124.24s)]
*  When one party's violent anti-democratic rioters are another party's heroes, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=130.4s)]
*  history tells us things can get ugly fast. And again, we kind of know how to see this, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=135.76s)]
*  how to interpret it when it happens in other places, when we can see the forces of democracy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=141.04s)]
*  and autocracy battling it out in the streets of, say, Kazakhstan. But it is much harder to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=146.88s)]
*  understand that battle and how to fight it when it's close up, when the democratic struggles that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  we've watched in other countries become our own. Joining us now is Ruth Ben-Ghiatt. She is a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=159.12s)]
*  professor of history at NYU, the author of Strong Men, Mussolini to the Present. She also writes a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=165.92s)]
*  newsletter on threats to democracy called Lucid, where she says this week, quote, we are living [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  through a right-wing counterrevolution and January 6th was a milestone on America's path away from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  democracy. Professor Ben-Ghiatt, it's good to see you again. Welcome. Thank you for being with us [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  tonight. Sure. I want to ask you about this issue that you write about in your book and other [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=187.28s)]
*  historians talk about, and that is that there is something about American exceptionalism, about the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=195.44s)]
*  strength of belief that Americans have in themselves, which is a little bit different [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=201.6s)]
*  from patriots in other countries, that doesn't allow us to see fundamental flaws or faults [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=205.04s)]
*  like the one that you described. There's something that doesn't want us to believe [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=211.76s)]
*  that what we saw a year ago was actually an attack on democracy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=215.84s)]
*  Americans have always been very invested in the idea of America as a beacon of freedom, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=221.84s)]
*  and it has been for so many immigrants who have come here. But there's a whole other side to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=227.2s)]
*  American engagement with democracy, such as all the coups during the Cold War, the juntas [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=232.96s)]
*  that the United States propped up and helped to happen. It's taken away democracy from countries. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  What's so poignant about that is right now we're living through a very serious assault on democracy, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=246.96s)]
*  and some of the people involved in that, Trump and Roger Stone and Bannon and Paul Manafort, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=254.96s)]
*  these are people with decades of experience in wrecking democracies and propping up dictatorships [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  and funding dictators in the case of Trump's money laundering. Trump, it's been a huge wakeup [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=266.48s)]
*  call. Because I study fascism, I saw very early who Trump was. I wrote Strongmen because I wanted to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  let my fellow Americans know that it can happen here, that over history, many other [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  cultures and peoples have been very amazed that it happened to them, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  and that Trump was not going to leave quietly because he was using an autocratic rather than [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  a democratic playbook to govern. Let me ask you about the language we use here. You talk about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=302.32s)]
*  it being a wakeup call, but not everybody's woken up yet. I want to quote from your book in which [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  you say, for a political system that affects the lives of so many, authoritarianism remains a [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=311.84s)]
*  surprisingly fuzzy concept. We still lack a common language to speak about the governments of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=316.88s)]
*  21st century authoritarian rulers who repress civil liberties but use elections to keep themselves [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=323.04s)]
*  in power. There are many Americans today who will say, there's nothing wrong with our democracy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=330.8s)]
*  We have elections. We will continue to have elections. Yeah, the problem with that is, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=335.68s)]
*  and we can look to Victor Orban, who Tucker Carlson and the GOP, even Mike Pence, they're [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=341.44s)]
*  all trotting over to Budapest. Today, you don't normally ban elections. That's less common. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=346.48s)]
*  You hold elections and you fix them, like the ruler of Kazakhstan and Belarus and Putin. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=353.44s)]
*  You can say you are, like Orban calls to stage an illiberal democracy. Well, there's not much [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=360.0s)]
*  democratic about it, but this is what's, of course, happening now at the level of the states. The GOP [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=366.24s)]
*  is assaulting our election mechanism, but this idea that you can still say you're a democracy, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=372.48s)]
*  you leave a pocket of opposition. So we are in this period of time where many states are in a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=379.12s)]
*  transition between democracy and autocracy. And some people use the word electoral autocracy. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=385.44s)]
*  Some people use the word anocracy to use, some people call the United States that after January [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  26. So we're still searching for a language because authoritarianism is itself in transition. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  I want to read something else that I think is interesting from your book, because one of the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=406.32s)]
*  discussions that we have is how we have this conversation with people who do not believe [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=409.44s)]
*  what you are saying to be the truth. You write that the decay of truth and democratic dissolution [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=413.52s)]
*  proceed hand in hand, starting with the insurgent's assertion that the establishment media delivers [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=418.08s)]
*  false or biased information while he speaks the truth and risks everything to get the real facts [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=424.16s)]
*  out. Once his supporters bond to this person, they stop caring about his falsehoods. This may be where [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=430.48s)]
*  we are with a good portion of Americans right now. Yeah, and Trump did this right away. And, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=437.92s)]
*  you know, I have a picture in my book about with a Hitler with his mouth tape shut because there [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=445.04s)]
*  was a speaking ban on Hitler in Weimar Germany because of his hate speech. And the Nazi party [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=450.56s)]
*  made political capital out of that, calling him a victim. So victimhood is very important to the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=456.16s)]
*  strongman profile. And the whole thing with Trump right now is that he is a very able propagandist, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=462.16s)]
*  a very able storyteller who is always the victim. And so this very compelling story of him as the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=469.2s)]
*  leader, the hero, the savior of the nation who's been wronged, that something that's rightfully his, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=475.84s)]
*  the election has been stolen from him. And he's trying to tell the truth. He's always had that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=481.52s)]
*  persona. And it's been really effective at building a fanatical base who are willing to go and [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=487.52s)]
*  wreck Congress for him. And I really see January 6th was a coup event. It was a milestone on a race [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=494.23999999999995s)]
*  war, but it's also an authoritarian leader cult rescue operation. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=501.12s)]
*  As Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern put it today at Slate.com, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=507.92s)]
*  quote, where the liberal justices see sickness and death, the conservatives see a chance to crush [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  government. It's a familiar pattern we've been watching play out all year, whether it's abortion [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=517.92s)]
*  rights or gun safety legislation, or policies aimed at combating a global pandemic. The Supreme [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  Court soon could become the place where major health and safety laws in America go to die. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=528.08s)]
*  What is there to be done about that? Joining us now is Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=534.8000000000001s)]
*  correspondent for Slate, whose latest piece is titled COVID is an Emergency to SCOTUS' [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=539.44s)]
*  Conservatives. It's also an opportunity. Good evening, Dahlia. Good to see you. Thank you for [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=544.88s)]
*  being with us. You know, you, you do this thing that most Americans don't do, and you listen to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=550.08s)]
*  these proceedings and you catch some of the nuances in them. And one of them that you caught [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=554.72s)]
*  today, you wrote about, you said, so acute is the contagion of medical misinformation coming from [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  the court itself that the three liberals had to keep clarifying for themselves as much as the public [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=565.52s)]
*  that the government is not proposing an Orwellian employment hellscape so much as safe and effective [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=571.84s)]
*  mitigation efforts for a lethal virus that is emptying workplaces, filling hospitals, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=577.84s)]
*  and debilitating medical professionals. I was a little alarmed to read that, that you were sort [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=583.2s)]
*  of feeling like some of this anti-vax nonsense that we associate with people out there is surfacing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=588.24s)]
*  at the court. It was almost impossible to miss. I mean, Justice Alito pretty explicitly started [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  talking with the solicitor general of the United States, Elizabeth Prelager, about how there are [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=605.36s)]
*  risks to this vaccine. And he kept saying, I don't want to be misunderstood. I know the FDA has [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=612.16s)]
*  approved them, but there are risks. There are risks. And she literally didn't know how to answer him [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=618.0s)]
*  because she said, by orders of magnitude, the vaccine is better than not the vaccine. But there [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  was just this drip drip of suspicion about the vaccine, suspicion about the administration's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=631.68s)]
*  motives, suspicions about how long this is going to last. The chief justice raised the specter of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=637.76s)]
*  this nefarious agency by agency by agency creep to sort of do an end run around civil liberties. It [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=644.0s)]
*  really felt like you were taking crazy pills, like you weren't sitting in the midst of a peaking [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=653.12s)]
*  catastrophic pandemic. The level of mistrust that you heard from the court's conservatives [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=659.76s)]
*  was just frankly shocking. Let's talk about the employer mandate. The night it was announced, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=665.92s)]
*  I spoke on this show to a former OSHA director who made the point that the way OSHA works, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  and anybody who works in a place that's governed by OSHA has those posters up that are either in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=681.36s)]
*  the cafeteria or some central place. And that is that if there is a hazard that you as an employer [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  can prevent your workers from being exposed to, you have an obligation to do so. And the way [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=690.7199999999999s)]
*  this mandate seemed to be phrased is that COVID is a hazard and you can take steps to prevent [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=695.68s)]
*  your employees from getting it so you should do so. The former director seemed to think that that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=701.52s)]
*  made it legally sound. What's happened to that? Two things have happened. One, I think there was [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=708.56s)]
*  an argument being pressed today that this isn't the same as sparks or flames or something in the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=716.2399999999999s)]
*  workplace. This is something different and so it can't be regulated as though it's something [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=722.96s)]
*  connected to a conveyor belt or a workplace, to which Justice Sotomayor said this is as though [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=729.84s)]
*  the thing that is sparking or flaming is the human being who is coughing particles into the air. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=735.9200000000001s)]
*  It's exactly the same. The workplace is dangerous. But the much larger project here, and I think you [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=742.08s)]
*  flicked at this in your initial question, is to really do away with the administrative state, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=747.68s)]
*  to do away with the regulatory state that enables agencies to create laws quickly. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  And this is part of a much larger project to dismantle the EPA, to dismantle HHS, to dismantle [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  OSHA, all under this large, large claim of you can call it the non-delegation doctrine, you can call [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=768.0s)]
*  it the major questions doctrine, but basically the idea that all of government is somehow [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=774.16s)]
*  unconstitutional. King's family plans to celebrate the holiday with a march to keep pressure on the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=779.76s)]
*  Senate to pass the For the People and the John Lewis Voting Rights Acts. But Martin Luther King, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=786.4s)]
*  Jr.'s son, Martin Luther King III, has stressed, quote, no celebration without legislation. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are facing pressure from other quarters [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=799.52s)]
*  to do more than offer forceful remarks on protecting the right to vote. On Tuesday, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=804.0s)]
*  the president and vice president will visit Atlanta to talk about voting rights and efforts [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=808.96s)]
*  by Georgia Republicans to limit voting access in that state. But ahead of their arrival, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=813.36s)]
*  a coalition of voting rights groups have released a statement essentially saying, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=818.96s)]
*  don't come to Atlanta without a plan to pass voting laws. Quote, Georgia voters made history [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=823.92s)]
*  and made their voices heard, overcoming obstacles, threats and suppressive laws [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=830.24s)]
*  to deliver the White House and the United States Senate. In return, a visit has been forced on them, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=835.92s)]
*  requiring them to accept political platitudes and repetitious bland promises. Such an empty gesture [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=842.4s)]
*  without concrete action, without signs of real tangible work is unacceptable. As civil rights [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=849.2s)]
*  leaders and advocates, we reject any visit by President Biden that does not include an announcement [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=856.16s)]
*  of a finalized voting rights plan that will pass both chambers, not be stopped by the filibuster [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=862.64s)]
*  and be signed into law. Anything less is insufficient and unwelcome. End quote. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now, Nse Ufot, she's the chair and the CEO of the New Georgia Project, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=876.48s)]
*  which is one of the groups that signed on to that letter. Nse, good to see you again. Thank you for [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=880.88s)]
*  being here tonight. That is a forceful letter. I'm curious about what you think the reaction [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=885.68s)]
*  will be and what you'd like the president and the vice president to be able to do to meet the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=893.3599999999999s)]
*  standards that are set out in that request. Well, I will say that some of the early reactions have [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=898.7199999999999s)]
*  been quite sort of visceral. I think that people think that we are being sort of harsh or sharp in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  our critique. But what our intent is and what I think is happening is that we are creating the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=914.48s)]
*  demand, right? So that there is no doubt that on this historic visit where we have not only [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=920.24s)]
*  the president of the United States, but also our vice president coming to this historic place, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=926.72s)]
*  the cradle of the civil rights movement, of the American civil rights movement here, our great [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=932.96s)]
*  state of Georgia, to talk about how our democracy, how our elections infrastructure is being attacked [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=936.88s)]
*  should hear from activists and organizers and ordinary Georgians on the ground about what they [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=944.96s)]
*  would like to see from this visit. So again, some people might frame it as a harsh criticism. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=951.2s)]
*  I absolutely see it as articulating the demand from their base. So now what happens when the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=957.6s)]
*  president and the vice president say, as they have said, we're on your side on this thing, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=965.04s)]
*  we fully agree with you. There's no policy difference between what you and your fellow [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=969.12s)]
*  groups have done in Georgia and what you want done and when what the president wants done. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=973.28s)]
*  But how do you propose or do you not propose that he get to that in terms of getting something that [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  looks like a plan that can pass when we say both houses of Congress, we really mean the Senate [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=984.24s)]
*  because we were able to pass it through the house and overcome the filibuster. What is it you're [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=988.72s)]
*  asking specifically to be done? Well, here's the thing. So Senator Schumer has already laid [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=993.28s)]
*  the plans, has articulated his ambitions to have a rule change vote on the 17th, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1000.4s)]
*  commemorating the birth of Martin Luther King. What I will say is, listen, I haven't served [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1007.52s)]
*  in that body for four decades, but I know someone who has and that's our president of the United [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1013.92s)]
*  States. And so my, it is our hope that with his 40 years of experience with his Senate colleagues [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1019.04s)]
*  and the bully pulpit that comes with being the president of the United States, right, that together [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1025.6s)]
*  he can work with the leaders in the Senate to articulate what the plan is, what a path forward [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1031.44s)]
*  is. Or if there is no plan, if Republicans have so thoroughly abdicated their responsibility to [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1036.8s)]
*  govern that there's no path forward, I think the American people need to hear that. I want to talk [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1044.56s)]
*  about some of the very specific things to some people. This is an abstraction. If you have never [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1050.48s)]
*  stood in a line to vote or you don't have problems registering to vote or your polling place is very [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1054.0s)]
*  close to you and you don't need transportation and you're able to take time off from work, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1060.08s)]
*  this is an abstraction. In Georgia, advocates, I just want to read this to our viewers, right now [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1063.44s)]
*  advocates and local leaders are fighting to stop the closure of seven out of eight polling places [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1069.12s)]
*  in Lincoln County, where over one third of the voters are black. Just next week, the state [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1074.16s)]
*  legislature will convene with Republican leaders already proudly touting their plans to attack [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1078.56s)]
*  voting access, push to ban drop boxes and erect new hurdles in the path of voters. This is very, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1083.76s)]
*  very practical for you and your organization and for voters in Georgia. It is literal, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1092.0s)]
*  physical impediments to people voting. Absolutely. This is not an academic discussion, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1097.76s)]
*  right? We are not sitting on our dorm room floor debating democracy. Like, what is happening? This [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1104.96s)]
*  is an active threat in real time. Our Republican leaders in Georgia and federally have not stuttered [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1111.92s)]
*  not once. They are unified. This is a well-funded attack and we are not just talking about Georgia. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1119.6000000000001s)]
*  We're not just talking about red states. I will not shut up about the fact that 400 anti-voting [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1127.28s)]
*  bills were introduced in nearly every state in our country in the 10 months, in the 11 months [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1134.96s)]
*  since legislative sessions started again in 2021. They are not playing. And I don't understand [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1142.88s)]
*  why people are not acting with a sense of urgency. There are tons of things in the [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1151.52s)]
*  president's domestic policy agenda and in the foreign policy agenda that we absolutely need [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1158.08s)]
*  passed. The Build Back Better bill is brilliant. The changes to infrastructure, the expansion of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1163.84s)]
*  the definition of infrastructure to include our frontline workers, our service workers, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1169.76s)]
*  the human capital, the people that make our country continue to run and that have kept us safe. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1174.3999999999999s)]
*  All of that is necessary. All of that is important. And none of that will happen [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1179.1999999999998s)]
*  if we are not able to secure people's participation in our elections. And I'm talking about [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1183.12s)]
*  rural counties in Georgia and we're talking about counties in California as well. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1189.28s)]
*  You underscore the most important point here. Thanks again for being with us and for the work [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  you do. And Seyufot is the CEO of the New Georgia Project. We appreciate you being with us tonight. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1198.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qCPmHJz2BM&t=1223.84s)]
