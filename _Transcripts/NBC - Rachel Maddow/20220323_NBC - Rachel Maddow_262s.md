# Concerns Grow That Desperation Will Drive Putin To Escalate His War In Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A)
*  Joining me is someone who has been inside the room for critical talks such as this one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=0.0s)]
*  Ivo Daldr served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=4.72s)]
*  He's now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=9.68s)]
*  Ambassador, good to have you here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=12.8s)]
*  Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=14.6s)]
*  I want to ask you about this meeting. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=16.2s)]
*  The world is looking for a response from NATO to the worsening atrocities in Ukraine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=18.52s)]
*  What do you think needs to be the headline out of tomorrow's NATO summit, which is probably [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  the most watched in more than 20 years? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=28.8s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=32.88s)]
*  I think the headline should be a warning to Vladimir Putin that any further escalation, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  in particular using chemical or biological weapons or agents or, God forbid, nuclear weapons, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=40.08s)]
*  will, as the secretary general said, fundamentally change the assessment that NATO has had [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=46.28s)]
*  with regard to its role in this conflict. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=52.36s)]
*  I don't think that NATO can stand by. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=55.56s)]
*  I don't think the United States can stand by if Vladimir Putin decides to use these [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  heinous weapons that are designed fundamentally to kill people, civilians in cities and other [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  places to be really effective and say, well, we'll send you some more Javelin missiles. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=70.92s)]
*  We need to continue to help Ukraine defend itself. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  But if that happens, in my view, we need to be prepared to to help Ukraine directly to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=80.0s)]
*  defend its country against this kind of attack. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=86.8s)]
*  The hope, of course, is that saying that will prevent Vladimir Putin from moving in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=89.64s)]
*  this direction and prevent the use of chemical weapons and prevent the use of nuclear [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=95.28s)]
*  weapons, because we're all much better off if that doesn't happen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=101.0s)]
*  I understand there are horrible things happening in Ukraine, but this is a step that would [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=104.8s)]
*  fundamentally change the strategic calculus and the situation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=110.6s)]
*  So I was just talking to the member of parliament, Inna Sovson, who is in Lviv. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=114.24s)]
*  She's from eastern Ukraine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=119.24s)]
*  Her son is now in western Ukraine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=120.44s)]
*  And she was saying that the good news today is that the Ukrainian forces seem to have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=122.32s)]
*  pushed the Russians back in some points around Lviv. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  The bad news, she fears, is that every day that Vladimir Putin hasn't taken Ukraine and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=131.76s)]
*  hasn't succeeded may be a day closer to either the use of chemical weapons or more air [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=137.24s)]
*  strikes or things that are more damaging. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=142.44s)]
*  How do you assess that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=144.24s)]
*  How does NATO and these leaders tomorrow, how do they assess that calculus? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=145.24s)]
*  Well, I think she's she's right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=150.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, Vladimir Putin is is not going to say, oh, my God, I made a mistake and pull [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=151.8s)]
*  his troops out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=157.16s)]
*  He as the intelligence community concluded a few weeks ago, Bill Burns, the CIA director [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=159.04s)]
*  said to Congress, he's more likely to double down. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=165.16s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons you heard the president's comments is that he's not going [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=168.16s)]
*  to hear the president say this this morning again, warning about a threat of chemical [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=172.24s)]
*  weapons. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=176.84s)]
*  One of the reasons there is now very serious concern within the administration about looking [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=177.84s)]
*  at the particular ways in which Putin can escalate and we need to respond. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=184.16s)]
*  And one of the reasons this is going to be an issue tomorrow in Brussels at the meeting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=188.84s)]
*  is because Vladimir Putin has not been able to achieve his military objectives. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  And he is likely unless he understands that the cost to him will even be greater, he would [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=199.6s)]
*  be likely to escalate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=205.0s)]
*  That's why it's important for NATO to make clear that if that happens, NATO is prepared [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=206.68s)]
*  not only to impose serious consequences, but at least quietly tell him it would mean that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=212.3s)]
*  NATO gets involved in the war and then he would really lose in Ukraine. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=220.04s)]
*  Evo Daldr, thank you for your analysis, for your time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=223.48s)]
*  You know what is actually going to be happening tomorrow, at least you're the closest to knowing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=229.32s)]
*  how that kind of thing goes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=233.28s)]
*  So we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=234.48s)]
*  Evo Daldr is a former United States ambassador to NATO and the president of the Chicago Council [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  on Global Affairs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9F7Rciub6A&t=240.6s)]
