# 'I will not permit it': Judge throttles Trump's ranting to protect trial integrity
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA)
*  Here in our national capital, the leader of the far right and the de facto leader of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican Party is, of course, on trial for his alleged role in trying to overturn the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=6.4s)]
*  result of the election in which he was voted out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=11.36s)]
*  It's only one of four cases in which Donald Trump is currently facing multiple felony [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=15.26s)]
*  charges. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=20.46s)]
*  But today, there was big news in his federal case in Washington. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=21.46s)]
*  Today, the judge overseeing Trump's federal criminal case in D.C., the one about him trying [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=26.16s)]
*  to overthrow the lawfully elected government of the United States, that federal judge in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=31.68s)]
*  Washington today instituted a limited version of what's generally called a gag order that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=36.68s)]
*  bans him by court order from disparaging the prosecutors or potential witnesses in his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=43.72s)]
*  or any personnel who work for the courts in which he is being tried. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Now, in terms of the exact contours of this court order, we are still expecting the judge's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=55.720000000000006s)]
*  written order. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=62.36s)]
*  But she did rule verbally from the bench today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=64.0s)]
*  And we got the transcript of it, which is amazing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=68.12s)]
*  It was this all-day long sort of rock-em-sock-em, rollicking hearing today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=71.16s)]
*  And at the very end of it, this was the judge giving part of the verbal version of the gag [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=76.44s)]
*  order which Donald Trump will now be bound by. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=82.92s)]
*  She said this, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=86.6s)]
*  who are simply doing their job. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=106.96s)]
*  My review of past statements made by Mr. Trump in particular, as well as the evidence that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=109.8s)]
*  they have led to harassment and threats for the people he has targeted, persuades me that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=114.2s)]
*  without this restriction, there's a real risk that witnesses may be intimidated or unduly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=118.56s)]
*  influenced and that other potential witnesses may be reluctant to come forward lest they [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  be subjected to the same harassment and intimidation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=128.26s)]
*  And she says this, quote, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=132.6s)]
*  But those critical First Amendment freedoms do not allow him to launch a pretrial smear [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=150.6s)]
*  campaign against participating government staff, their families, and foreseeable witnesses. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  No other criminal defendant would be allowed to do so, and I am not going to allow it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=161.22s)]
*  in this case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=165.8s)]
*  She then concludes with this, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=168.78s)]
*  I will, either upon receipt of a motion or suespante, meaning on my own as the judge, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=191.22s)]
*  I will consider sanctions as may be necessary. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=201.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=206.42s)]
*  We're adjourned. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=207.42s)]
*  Bang. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=208.42s)]
*  The gavel falls. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=209.42s)]
*  Accountability. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=212.42s)]
*  Judge Tanya Chutkin, ruling from the bench today in Washington, we await the written [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=213.42s)]
*  version of this order. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=218.9s)]
*  Trump already says he's going to appeal it, but as of now, he is bound by it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=221.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans appear poised to elevate Donald Trump's closest major ally in Congress [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=225.74s)]
*  to be Speaker of the House, which would put Congressman Jim Jordan, among other things, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=233.58s)]
*  third in the line of succession after the president and the vice president. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=239.62s)]
*  Jim Jordan, of course, played a key role in Trump's efforts to use Congress to try to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=245.1s)]
*  overturn the election result in 2020. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=249.6s)]
*  If he does become speaker, I got to say it feels like it becomes basically an open question [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=252.42s)]
*  as to whether a House of Representatives under Jim Jordan's leadership would ever certify [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=258.86s)]
*  the election results of an election in which Donald Trump ran but lost. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXSc8plZJrA&t=264.82s)]
