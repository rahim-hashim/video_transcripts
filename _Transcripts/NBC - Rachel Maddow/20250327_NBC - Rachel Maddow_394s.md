# New political leadership: Regular Americans show how to stand up to Trump as political leaders fail
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI)
*  Regular Americans just pulling it together on their own to save Social [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=0.0s)]
*  Security. That woman in Grand Rapids, Michigan yesterday saying, I woke up this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=5.28s)]
*  morning and said, I got to do something. And by afternoon there she was. And [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=9.52s)]
*  Americans all over the country are waking up every day somewhere having [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=15.68s)]
*  that same feeling. And that political leadership from regular Americans is now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=20.64s)]
*  starting to push over the right dominoes. We are starting to see, for example, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=26.4s)]
*  stirrings from big powerful groups that at least used to have a lot of sway on [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=32.16s)]
*  issues like this. Groups like AARP. AARP is fighting to protect your Social [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=37.08s)]
*  Security. You've worked hard and paid into Social Security with every paycheck [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=45.84s)]
*  your entire working life. But recently we've heard from thousands of worried [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=49.76s)]
*  Americans. That's why we're asking for three assurances right now. One, Social [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=54.12s)]
*  Security will make payments on time like it has for almost 90 years. Two, claims [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=59.8s)]
*  will be processed on time and not backlogged for months. Three, customer [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=65.88s)]
*  service will be a top priority. Getting rid of phone service and asking tens of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=71.08s)]
*  millions of Americans to jump through new hoops or drive hours to a local [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  office is deeply unacceptable. Join me in sending a loud and clear message to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  lawmakers. Social Security must be protected. Take action now at AARP.org [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=84.76s)]
*  slash pledge. Tell lawmakers it's your money. You've earned it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=91.56s)]
*  Let's hear her say there at the beginning. Recently we've heard from [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  thousands of worried Americans. Hello AARP. I thought you would be blanketing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=99.68s)]
*  the nation with super effective ads and hounding every member of the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  administration every day up to and including the president. It's kind of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=111.56s)]
*  what I have come to expect from AARP. We are not seeing anything like that yet [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=116.4s)]
*  from AARP. But they are admitting that thousands of their own members are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=120.64s)]
*  contacting them now and they are showing signs of life. And when you combine that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=125.28s)]
*  with the real political leadership that we are seeing from regular Americans who [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=132.24s)]
*  just wake up one morning and say I've got to do something and then they go do [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=135.88s)]
*  something. Well you know what it works. It has an impact. It pushes over one [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=139.24s)]
*  domino that then pushes down another. For example we had Trump's Social Security [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=145.64s)]
*  nominee have his desultory little confirmation hearing this week in the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=150.76s)]
*  United States Senate. But at that hearing you had Republican senators, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=154.44s)]
*  Republicans asking hey wait how many Social Security offices are you closing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=157.68s)]
*  in my state. My constituents are telling me that Social Security service is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=163.08s)]
*  collapsing and look I had my staff confirm it after Trump fired all these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  people at Social Security. Turns out it now takes hours to get through on the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=174.44s)]
*  phone and then even when you've waited on the phone for hours you get cut off [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=178.56s)]
*  anyway. Hey Social Security nominee from the Trump administration what's going on [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  here. You got that this week even from Republican senators. You have the top [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Republicans in the Senate who supposedly oversees Social Security who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=191.2s)]
*  until now have been totally silent as Trump has been firing thousands of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  people from the agency as his top campaign donor has been given access to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  all the most sensitive systems at the agency while he publicly calls it a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  Ponzi scheme that must be shut down as the service has started to palpably [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  collapse. They have been silent and have been doing nothing but now you've got [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  them having to admit to reporters and whining a little bit about it that maybe [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=217.68s)]
*  they should be in on some of this stuff. For NBC News quote Republican Senator [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=221.6s)]
*  Chuck Grassley the chairman of a key Senate subcommittee on Social Security [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=226.56s)]

*  by the way the new system they said they want to put in place doesn't exist but [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1bE5Ov3WI&t=340.97999999999996s)]
