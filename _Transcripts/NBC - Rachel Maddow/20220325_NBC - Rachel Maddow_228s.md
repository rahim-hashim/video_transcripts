# Putin Reportedly Suspects Betrayal From Within His Inner Circle
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo)
*  Joining us now is Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist expert on Russian state intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=0.0s)]
*  apparatus, the author of The Compatriots, the brutal and chaotic history of Russia's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=6.08s)]
*  exiles, emigres, and agents abroad. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=11.48s)]
*  Andrei, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=14.72s)]
*  There's something so interesting in your reporting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=18.16s)]
*  Your sources do not believe that these disappearances in Vladimir Putin's inner circle are punishment [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=20.6s)]
*  for the war not going the way they planned, but they might actually be a mole hunt. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=26.36s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Yes, we got some reports to actually to you two weeks ago that Vladimir Putin decided [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=32.24s)]
*  to attack the FSB, as you rightly mentioned, and as the head of the espionage unit of the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=40.6s)]
*  FSB was placed under house arrest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  The first report indicated that he was placed under house arrest because the intelligence [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=51.4s)]
*  provided to Putin before the invasion was not extremely accurate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  They didn't expect any resistance for the Russian troops. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=63.08s)]
*  And we know now that's actually what is happening is the fierce resistance from the Ukrainians. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=69.16s)]
*  But it looks like now it's becoming something else. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=77.72s)]
*  It's not only about bad intelligence and it's not only about misusing of funds allocated [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=81.0s)]
*  by the government to cultivate political groups in Ukraine, which would be more supportive [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=87.96s)]
*  of the Russian invasion, but it's also about trying to find a source of the U.S. intelligence [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=94.28s)]
*  and why this U.S. intelligence before the war was so accurate. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=100.44s)]
*  And it started with the FSB and this particular unit because this unit was also in charge [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=104.44s)]
*  of maintaining official contacts with CIA. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=109.24s)]
*  So they started there because these guys were known to have at least some contacts [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=112.92s)]
*  with the American intelligence. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=118.28s)]
*  Now let's talk about the defense minister Shoigu being out of the public eye. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, this is not a name or a person with whom our Western audiences are familiar. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=126.52s)]
*  Why? Tell me about why this was such a big deal that he was he would seem to be very [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  active at the beginning of the invasion and then suddenly seemed to have disappeared for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=135.8s)]
*  two weeks. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  And now there's questions about whether this video that he was on is really current or [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=140.12s)]
*  from from two weeks ago. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=145.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, this war is very different from what we had before with Putin and we had [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=148.28s)]
*  a war in Chechnya and Georgia and in Syria. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  And in all these wars, we have a commander who was in charge of the operation on the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=157.4s)]
*  battlefield. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=162.44s)]
*  This war is different because we do not have such a person. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=163.72s)]
*  The public face of the war from the military side is Sergey Shoigu, the minister of defense, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  despite the fact that he has no military training, no military education, and he's an [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=172.36s)]
*  engineer by his training. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=178.36s)]
*  Nevertheless, because he was always extremely close to Putin, they spend their holidays [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  together and Shoigu is a very popular politician in the country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=185.72000000000003s)]
*  He became a public face of the war. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=190.76s)]
*  Now he disappeared for almost two weeks and there is no public explanation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=193.16s)]
*  There are some rumors that maybe he had some problems with his heart. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=198.04s)]
*  Maybe the problem is that the war is not going the way everybody in Moscow wanted to go. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=202.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qgz8g7-yzo&t=220.76s)]
