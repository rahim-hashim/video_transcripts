Video Description: Rachel Maddow notes that with each new presidential election cycle, Russians have found ways to try to influence the outcome by some underhanded means.

# Maddow: With each new election cycle, Republicans accept Russian help with greater ease
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w)
*  For months and months, Republican lawmakers and conservative media have been trumpeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=0.0s)]
*  these bribery allegations made by Smirnoff against President Biden and his family. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=5.28s)]
*  The Washington Post today estimates that Fox News alone mentioned it more than 2,600 times [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=9.96s)]
*  over the past single year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=17.52s)]
*  Republicans in Congress pushed the allegation endlessly, even though the FBI explicitly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=21.12s)]
*  warned them that the claim was uncorroborated and unreliable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=26.28s)]
*  And now the man who's the source of the allegation, the guy who said it, he's in jail, indicted [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=31.04s)]
*  for lying to federal investigators about this very matter and accused by prosecutors of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=36.58s)]
*  feeding the FBI disinformation from Russian intelligence. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=41.28s)]
*  Which would be shocking had we not lived through the last few years, because this, of course, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=46.2s)]
*  This is now the third straight presidential election cycle in which Russian intelligence [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=52.92s)]
*  has done some version of this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  In 2016, as you may have heard, Russian intelligence hacked the Democratic National Committee and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  the Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=65.16s)]
*  And then they weaponized the material they stole by releasing hacked emails through WikiLeaks [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=67.08s)]
*  and all timed and strategically released to have maximum negative effect for Clinton and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=72.68s)]
*  the Democrats and maximum positive effect for Donald Trump and the Republicans. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=77.68s)]
*  And it was well known at the time that this whole thing was likely a Russian intelligence [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=82.3s)]
*  operation, but Trump and Republicans and conservative media and the mainstream media, frankly, mostly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=86.17999999999999s)]
*  ate it up and pounced on every single email dump as if they had just come down on Mount [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=91.12s)]
*  Sinai on tablets rather than being shoveled by Russian intelligence into the garbage chute. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=95.52s)]
*  Remember Trump talking at rallies about how much he loved WikiLeaks? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=103.62s)]
*  He was welcoming it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=108.0s)]
*  He was asking for more. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=109.0s)]
*  Russian government and Russian intelligence sources made multiple contacts with the Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=111.26s)]
*  campaign. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=114.62s)]
*  Russia ran a big, weird social media campaign to try to influence American public debate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  and public opinion in Trump's favor. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=120.04s)]
*  The Trump campaign gave non-public polling information to a Russian intelligence agent, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=123.26s)]
*  according to the Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=129.1s)]
*  The Russians had this hack and leak campaign with the Democratic emails. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=131.94s)]
*  They were very busy in 2016 trying to help Trump. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=134.82s)]
*  Then four years later, 2020, another try. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=138.98000000000002s)]
*  This time Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was peddling stories about Joe Biden's supposed [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=141.24s)]
*  corruption that he said he had dug up from his sources in Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Once again, it turned out that Giuliani's main source was Russian intelligence. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=149.52s)]
*  A report from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence later determined [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=154.88s)]
*  that Giuliani's source was part of a U.S. election interference operation likely directed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=158.88s)]
*  by Putin himself with the goal of helping Trump win a second term in 2020. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  And once again, Republicans had been warned by American intelligence officials that the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=170.32s)]
*  stuff that Giuliani was shoveling was likely part of a Russian op. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=174.12s)]
*  They apparently just did not care. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=179.32s)]
*  And again, this is not some obscure thing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=182.72s)]
*  People got sanctioned by the U.S. government for this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=184.64s)]
*  People got indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for this. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=187.18s)]
*  But meh. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=190.68s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=191.68s)]
*  It might have helped Trump, so we went along with it as far as we could. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=193.08s)]
*  And now, four years later, here we are again. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=197.74s)]
*  They keep doing this every election cycle. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=200.04s)]
*  They keep doing some version of the same thing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  The Russians keep doing the same thing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=204.92s)]
*  What seems to be changing a little bit is that the Republicans appear to have fewer [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=206.44s)]
*  and fewer qualms each year about welcoming and even participating in these Russian campaigns. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=210.16s)]
*  Fool me once, shame on you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=218.12s)]
*  Fool me twice, shame on me. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=219.56s)]
*  Fool me three times. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  I clearly want to be fooled, or maybe we should stop calling this foolish. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=222.16s)]
*  This is something else. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=226.56s)]
*  We did this in 2016. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=229.18s)]
*  We did this in 2020. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=230.18s)]
*  Now in 2024, Republicans appear to be more enthusiastic about participating in it than [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=231.46s)]
*  they ever have been before. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=237.32s)]
*  But of course, now, this Russian disinformation campaign, trying to paint Biden as mired in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=240.18s)]
*  some kind of bribery scandal, it's happening with American aid to Ukraine hanging in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=245.3s)]
*  balance, with this life or death question looming of whether Ukraine will be able to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=251.82s)]
*  hold off a third year of the Russian invasion. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=256.18s)]
*  Russia is doing everything it can to undermine American support for Ukraine. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=261.7s)]
*  And in the midst of a third straight effort by Russia to influence our election to Republicans [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=266.42s)]
*  benefit, Republicans frankly seem quite receptive both to that election interference and to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=272.18s)]
*  what Russia wants them to do in cutting off Ukraine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZRWP0f8a_w&t=277.54s)]
