# Lack of answers from Trump on tariff game plan leaves investors uneasy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw)
*  First, joining us here on set, NBC News White House correspondent, Vaughn Hilliard. Vaughn, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=0.0s)]
*  great to see you here in New York. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=5.36s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Take us inside the administration on a day like today. What are you hearing from your [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  sources? What has the reaction been as the president's bombshell news of the tariffs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=12.4s)]
*  sends markets into a freefall? We're hearing some layoffs from some companies already. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=18.04s)]
*  And we're seeing his administration try to spin this by saying, look, a little bit of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=23.28s)]
*  pain, but it's going to pay off in the long run. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  There's an inability to explain what the ultimate endgame is of this. And that is why it is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=29.92s)]
*  so striking to see the likes of Chuck Grassley, Rand Paul, Susan Collins, even Ted Cruz suggesting [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=35.68s)]
*  that he could potentially get on board with this 60-day requirement that ultimately Congress [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=42.88s)]
*  would have to approve these tariffs. Because what you are looking at is an administration [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=48.36s)]
*  compared to the first one that has not articulated over the last 24 hours what concessions are [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=52.28s)]
*  even looking for from these litany of countries. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=58.12s)]
*  Right? In talking, I just got off a plane from the Midwest here where I was talking with some [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=60.96s)]
*  Republican farmers, ones that voted for Trump three times. Absolutely. But even they said that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  the first go around, they were able to articulate, right, we want to renegotiate NAFTA, right? Or [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=69.92s)]
*  we're going to take the China. We want greater market access. We want them to stop, you know, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=74.0s)]
*  putting money towards a state, Chinese subsidized companies. Right? There is a lot of actual [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  tangibles. But whether it be Secretary Besant or Secretary Lutnick or the president himself, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=84.0s)]
*  they have struggled to say and articulate to these members of Congress, but also the American [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=90.0s)]
*  people, what their goal is of this here at a time in which we're watching an American economy here [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=94.16s)]
*  question itself. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=100.0s)]
*  So I want to drill down on that for a moment, which is what is the end goal here with these [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=100.8s)]
*  tariffs? What is the president's stated end goal? What is perhaps happening behind the scenes? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=104.72s)]
*  It seems to me as an outside observer, there is mixed messaging, right? On one hand, they want [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  to negotiate with these countries. And at the same time, they're saying, hey, hey, we don't want any [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=113.04s)]
*  of these countries to make rash decisions. We want them to be rational and not to escalate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=117.2s)]
*  And it's hard to watch this in real time, as we just played some of the reactions from world [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=122.0s)]
*  leaders to say they're not going to react in the same manner that we have. So it kind of begs the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=126.64s)]
*  question, what is the end goal for Trump with these tariffs? Is it to force these countries to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=132.72s)]
*  negotiate? Is it to bring manufacturing back into the U.S.? Do we have any sense of what that is? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=138.72s)]
*  Well, the president himself said this was not going to be a negotiating tactic until today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=144.0s)]
*  He said it was a negotiating tactic. And this is where the administration has struggled to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=148.32s)]
*  articulate what the actual purpose is of these tariffs at a time in which there are millions of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=152.32s)]
*  Americans who are looking at their retirement accounts, questioning the direction that whether [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=158.0s)]
*  they're going to have the means to continue on in this fashion. But then you also have the likes of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=163.36s)]
*  you when you're talking about some of these farmers who were questioning what crops that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=168.72s)]
*  they're currently seeding here in these weeks ahead. Where are those export markets going to be? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=173.44s)]
*  If you take corn, for instance, about 30% of corn is exported overseas, about 25% of pork. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=177.6s)]
*  And these are folks, they're not just out there planting, but they're out there actually going [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=182.8s)]
*  overseas and actually making these trading partners themselves, finding those export markets. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=186.64s)]
*  And they're questioning not just this fall, but long term. Is China going to turn to Brazil [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=191.44s)]
*  for corn instead? I think those are the questions that the administration to this day has still [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=195.6s)]
*  been unable to answer. And I think it's important to know who is actually having this conversation [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  in the Oval Office. We cannot move away from the point that while he was preparing to make [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=206.0s)]
*  these Rose Garden remarks yesterday, it was Laura Loomer who was there inside of the Oval Office with [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  him. And why is that important? Because she is a preeminent conspiracy theorist who has no regard [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  for basic facts and the truth. And the fact that those, when we look at the history books at this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=222.8s)]
*  moment, on April 2nd at the White House, the fact that such an announcement like that was made at [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=227.12s)]
*  the same time that Laura Loomer was in the Oval Office with him is striking. And I think it goes [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  to the fact that there are serious questions from economists about exactly what the end game here is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=236.08s)]
*  and how the president perceives his own economic policy and its impact on people. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=240.8s)]
*  So you bring up a really important point as to who was with the president. We kind of know from [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=244.08s)]
*  previous years of reporting on him, he always kind of takes the impression of whoever was last in the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  room with him. We outline that there are some Republicans, certainly in Congress and the Senate, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=251.68s)]
*  who have now broken rank with him on this issue, four, growing number perhaps. But it does make [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=256.0s)]
*  you wonder, were there any attempts, do you know of any attempts by Republicans to get to the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=262.64s)]
*  president before this announcement about the tariffs and say, hold on, slow your roll. I know [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=268.24s)]
*  you've been talking about it, you've been promising Liberation Day, but let's just kind of game this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=273.12s)]
*  out and play this out over the next 24 hours. Do we know whether there was any attempts to dissuade [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=277.04s)]
*  him from the train wreck that we saw play out today? No, and as opposed to the first administration [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=281.2s)]
*  at the likes of Dena Powell or Gary Cohn, who were there by the president's side, I think that's where [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  it's important when you're looking at somebody like Suzy Wiles, the chief of staff to the president [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=290.88s)]
*  of the United States, she was heralded as a successful campaign manager. You know why she [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=294.8s)]
*  was successful? Why Republicans loved Suzy Wiles? Because she was not a true gatekeeper to Donald [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump. She allowed everybody to have his ear and ultimately Donald Trump ran his campaign. She is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  now the chief of staff and what we are watching in these first two and a half months of this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=310.88s)]
*  administration is yet again the full access to the president himself and he is the one who is calling [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=314.64s)]
*  these shots and as he promised, he surrounded himself by people in this cabinet who knew what [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=320.64s)]
*  they were signing up for this go-around. He was promising on the campaign trail tariffs on China [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=325.44s)]
*  of up to 60 percent. That is exactly what he's now implementing and he had people like Howard [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=329.36s)]
*  Lutnick there at Madison Square Garden the week before the election on the stage celebrating those [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=333.76s)]
*  tariffs and I think notably, Aiman, convincing a great share of this American population, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=338.64s)]
*  millions of Americans including one I just got off the phone with, that this is the right path [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=343.52s)]
*  forward. In that short-term pain is the president is telling them that they are about to endure [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  whether it be from the farms or from the brewery or over at their local store. Or 401k or 401k [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=352.32s)]
*  is being wiped out today. That short-term pain is going to be worth it in the end and there are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=357.76s)]
*  millions of Americans that voted in that belief and now are expecting him to come through. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  The question is that first administration he had tariffs on Canada in Mexico for nine months. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  He had tariffs on China for 18 months. This is not a president who has ever shown a willingness [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=372.16s)]
*  to back back down or acknowledge that he was wrong. Von Hilliard, it's great to see you. I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=376.8s)]
*  am sure it is going to be a long couple of days as this continues to unfold. Really appreciate your [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=382.24s)]
*  reporting. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=386.08s)]
*  you [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPebSA1atTw&t=396.24s)]
