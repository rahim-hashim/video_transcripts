# Ukraine's Rejection Of Russian Corruption Set Context For Putin's Invasion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw)
*  I'm joined once again by the former ambassador to Ukraine, Maria Ivanovich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for waiting and for being with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Colonel Alexander Vindman was on the show earlier this week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=7.72s)]
*  He essentially told me that he believes there's a direct line between what happened on that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=10.68s)]
*  July 2019 phone call between Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky and what [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=15.48s)]
*  we're seeing now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=20.84s)]
*  He believes that Donald Trump weakened Zelensky by withholding a White House meeting and the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=21.84s)]
*  military aid at the exact time that Zelensky, who was a new and untried president, needed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=27.04s)]
*  it the most. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=32.2s)]
*  Two and a half years later, how damaging was that whole incident in which you also became [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=33.2s)]
*  involved to the standing and potential success of President Zelensky in Ukraine right now? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=39.2s)]
*  Well, there's no question that that whole series of events really damaged the trust [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=44.2s)]
*  between the two countries. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=51.08s)]
*  Zelensky had been not a politician. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=52.96s)]
*  He had been a comedian. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=55.88s)]
*  And this was one of his very first experiences in international relations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=57.4s)]
*  And he said publicly after that he didn't really trust any other countries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=61.8s)]
*  So it was quite damaging. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=66.12s)]
*  But even more so, I think, when the transcripts were released, others like President Putin [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=67.92s)]
*  contempt with which President Trump was dealing with President Zelensky. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=76.72s)]
*  And I think that in itself was very damaging. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  And more broadly, the whole world could see that the president of the United States was [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  ready to trade our national security interests for his own personal and political gain. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=92.8s)]
*  Hugely, hugely damaging because you have, you know, everybody who is so inclined wanting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=100.44s)]
*  to jump onto the gravy train. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=106.32s)]
*  So yeah, I would say it was a very damaging, damaging incident. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=108.56s)]
*  But fast forward to today, Zelensky, President Zelensky, you know, has made the transition [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=112.58s)]
*  from comedian to president of a developing democracy to a war hero, a man who is inspiring [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=121.44s)]
*  not only his own country, but the world. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=128.82s)]
*  Tell me about this effort that you were involved in to fight corruption in Ukraine and try [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=131.42s)]
*  and get it to a place where it could join the European Union and ultimately NATO. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=136.46s)]
*  Well, that was U.S. policy and it was also Ukrainian policy following the Revolution [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  of Dignity in 2014. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=147.3s)]
*  And what that term means, it's kind of an obscure term for Americans, but what it means [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=149.3s)]
*  is rule of law. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=154.34s)]
*  Americans were tired of having one set of rules for the oligarchs and leaders of the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=156.58s)]
*  country where they could do whatever they wanted. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=161.62s)]
*  And ordinary people had to do, had to follow the laws and were often, you know, the victims [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  of corrupt efforts to shake them down and so forth. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  People were sick of it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  And they mounted these street demonstrations because they wanted to join the EU when the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  previous pro-Russian president had not, had turned his back on that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  And it turned into the Revolution of Dignity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  And so there was a, President Poroshenko came in and there was a very clear policy on the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=189.94s)]
*  part of the Ukrainian government and pro-reform activists and politicians that they wanted [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=197.66s)]
*  to turn the country around, get a hold of corruption, move forward on their democratic [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=204.92s)]
*  efforts and create the rule of law in Ukraine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=210.24s)]
*  And we wanted to support that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=215.6s)]
*  We thought that that would be terrific for Ukraine, a country, after all, of 44 million [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=216.92s)]
*  people in the heart of Europe. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=222.32s)]
*  And we thought it would be good for us as well to have a strong democratic country as [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=226.16s)]
*  a partner in that part of Europe. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  So we all were working quite hard to support the efforts of the Ukrainians in that direction. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=235.84s)]
*  And I think Zelensky certainly in his first pro-reform government was working in that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=242.4s)]
*  direction. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=246.24s)]
*  I need to say that reforms in any country, whether it's in the U.S., Ukraine or a third [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=248.6s)]
*  country, you know, they go in fits and starts. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=255.6s)]
*  It's never a straight line. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=257.68s)]
*  So the Ukrainians have made progress since 2014. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=260.16s)]
*  They have made progress since Zelensky came to power. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=264.08s)]
*  But it's not in a straight line. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=268.64s)]
*  And I think the Ukrainian people are still hoping for more progress in that area. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=269.92s)]
*  But right now, the entire country, the entire political spectrum is united behind President [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=275.08s)]
*  Zelensky to fight the common foe, which is Russia. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=282.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's important to remember that no country is a monolith and Ukraine has its own politics [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  inside of it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=292.08s)]
*  But right now they are united around this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  A final comment from you, a final thought from you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=295.4s)]
*  You knew of Volodymyr Zelensky when he first became president. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=297.84s)]
*  Most Americans had never heard the name. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  He was a young man. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=304.36s)]
*  He's 44 years old right now. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=305.36s)]
*  And as recently as a month ago, there were Western leaders saying this guy is not up [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=307.2s)]
*  to the challenge of going up against the master manipulator, Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=310.8s)]
*  What has Volodymyr Zelensky done that has impressed you in the last several weeks? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I've been very impressed by how he has used his communication skills as an actor, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=322.76s)]
*  as a comedian and his executive skills as the head of a large media empire. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  And now, you know, the president of a large country in the heart of Europe, he has combined [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=336.56s)]
*  those two talents to communicate with his people in a time of great stress and peril, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=342.48s)]
*  unite the Ukrainian people behind him and inspire the world. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=349.68s)]
*  He has, you know, the man has met the moment. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  He is a true Ukrainian hero right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=357.6s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=364.36s)]
*  For Ambassador to Ukraine, Maria Ivanovich is the author of a new memoir called Lessons [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=365.8s)]
*  from the Edge. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9rphJDs3sw&t=370.96s)]
