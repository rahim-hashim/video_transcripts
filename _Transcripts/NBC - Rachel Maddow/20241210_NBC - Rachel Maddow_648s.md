# Maddow: Shambolic transition inspires little confidence in Trump's coming term
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg)
*  This was another of the excellent own goals from the Trump transition thus far. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the Republican senators who they're really counting on to lead the charge for Trump's nominees, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=5.0s)]
*  a senator who's really been out there in front for them saying every one of Trump's choices is somebody who should be confirmed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=11.0s)]
*  and all the Republicans should vote for them, the guy who's really been most out front for them leading everything is this senator. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=18.0s)]
*  His name is often mispronounced Tuberville. It is not Tuberville, it is Tuberville. His name is Tommy Tuberville, the senator from Alabama. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=24.0s)]
*  There's more rumors up there going around about Matt Gaetz and Pete Hedstead and even all of them will have some kind of rumor when it comes down to it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=37.0s)]
*  But we've got to look at facts, but we've got to help President Trump. He's not going to pick somebody that's a criminal. He's not going to do that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=45.0s)]
*  Oh, is that so? Is he not going to do that? Again, that's a senator they need. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=53.0s)]
*  That's the guy sort of whipping the votes and telling all the other Republicans they need to vote for every Trump nominee. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=60.0s)]
*  What's that last thing he said again? Play that again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=66.0s)]
*  He's not going to pick somebody that's a criminal. He's not going to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=69.0s)]
*  He's not going to pick somebody that's a criminal. Right after Senator Tuberville said that, Trump in fact named a convicted felon, his relative Charles Kushner, to be the ambassador to France. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=73.0s)]
*  Followed very shortly by Trump naming Peter Navarro to be his new trade advisor. Mr. Navarro just got out of federal prison this summer. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=86.0s)]
*  He's not going to pick somebody that's a criminal. He's not going to do that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=98.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes he is. Yes he is, Senator. Multiple times he's going to do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=103.0s)]
*  But he's going to wait until right after you say on television that he's not going to do that to do it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=107.0s)]
*  So as to make it maximally embarrassing and insulting to you personally. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=114.0s)]
*  He's going to wait until you say he's not going to appoint a criminal and then he's going to appoint a criminal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=119.0s)]
*  And then he's going to appoint another one right after you said that on television with everybody listening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=123.0s)]
*  And they really need you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=128.0s)]
*  The Trump transition has been amazing in all sorts of ways. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=130.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal today ran a feature on the various and dubious pills and potions being sold by multiple Trump nominees for high office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=135.0s)]
*  Some of them continuing to shill for this stuff even after they've been named as a choice for a high position in the government. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=143.0s)]
*  Trump's surgeon general choice has her line of celebrity vitamins, which she sells on Instagram. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=152.0s)]
*  They've got her picture on the label. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=158.0s)]
*  Trump's would be Medicare chief who will sell you any number of things that might cure your Alzheimer's or your thyroid ailments or might make the fat melt away like magic. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=161.0s)]
*  Trump's choice for FBI director who will sell you pills that reverse the covid vaccine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=171.0s)]
*  Sure, because sure. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=178.0s)]
*  The president elect himself is still selling stuff during the transition as well. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=182.0s)]
*  Literally since the election, he has been rolling out new products and hawking stuff online. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=187.0s)]
*  He's still selling the the Bibles and the watches and the sneakers and the commemorative coins and whatever. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=192.0s)]
*  But since the election, he has branched out into selling commemorative guitars. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=198.0s)]
*  Literally since winning the election and becoming president elect, he started selling guitars this weekend. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=203.0s)]
*  He literally started selling smells, new Trump fragrances, Trump branded odors in a bottle. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=209.0s)]
*  He's doing new product launches for this stuff while also expertly managing the presidential transition, which is going just great. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=217.0s)]
*  And the news like sometimes intrudes on this comedy of errors and embarrassment. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=227.0s)]
*  Today, we have news of a young man being arrested and charged in conjunction with the assassination of a health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=235.0s)]
*  This young man has been charged with forgery and a firearms offense at this point and with people looking for a possible motive or an explanation for that crime. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=244.0s)]
*  One of the things in this guy's Internet history that's gotten a lot of attention today is a very enthusiastic review he appears to have given to the manifesto of the Unabomber. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=255.0s)]
*  Ted Kaczynski, who killed three people and injured nearly 23 others and injured 23 others in a bombing campaign that spanned more than 15 years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=265.0s)]
*  This young man arrested today, he has not been charged with the killing of United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=276.0s)]
*  We don't yet know if he will be charged with that killing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=283.0s)]
*  But if it is him, the fact that he's a professed Unabomber fan is unsettling. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=286.0s)]
*  I might venture that it's even more unsettling that Donald Trump's reported choice to run the ATF is also a self professed fan of the Unabomber. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=293.0s)]
*  Do you have a subversive thinker that you think people should look up, look into, know more about that's underrated and would influence people in a good direction? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=307.0s)]
*  Subversive thinker that's underrated? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=323.0s)]
*  I'll probably get in trouble for saying this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=324.0s)]
*  I'd say, how about like Theodore Kaczynski? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=328.0s)]
*  Theodore Kaczynski. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=334.0s)]
*  Blake Masters later admitted, quote, probably not great to be talking about the Unabomber while campaigning. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=335.0s)]
*  Just to be clear that he knew that when he was talking about Theodore Kaczynski, he's talking about the Unabomber. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=344.0s)]
*  Underrated thinker, people should look into him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=349.0s)]
*  People should look into an underrated thinker that would influence people in a good direction. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=352.0s)]
*  Unabomber fan reportedly Trump's choice to lead the ATF, which despite its acronym, is responsible not only for alcohol, tobacco and firearms, but also explosives. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=357.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=371.0s)]
*  Why not put the Unabomber fan in charge of the federal agency that regulates explosives? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=372.0s)]
*  We've also had news in the last few days that Trump has his choice made for his special envoy for hostage affairs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=382.0s)]
*  Incredibly serious job, literally life or death stakes every single day and every single circumstance in which that envoy works. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=390.0s)]
*  Just an unbelievably sensitive position in the U.S. government for that job. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=397.0s)]
*  His special envoy for hostage affairs. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=402.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has reportedly chosen Jared Kushner's college roommate. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=404.0s)]
*  Sure. Why not? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=410.0s)]
*  And I mean, as long as we're talking about the news intruding on this reverie, we've also just had the fall of Syria. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=414.0s)]
*  And the exile of the longtime Syrian dictator considered responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in his country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=420.0s)]
*  The torture and unjust incarceration of tens of thousands of people, many in secret prisons. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=429.0s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad had just been thrown out of office by an uprising in Syria. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=435.0s)]
*  He has fled the country. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=441.0s)]
*  Russia says he's gone to Moscow. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=442.0s)]
*  And maybe he has. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=444.0s)]
*  But here in the midst of the Trump transition, Bashar al-Assad's highest profile champion and apologist and propagandist in the United States is Trump's choice to be the nation's next director of national intelligence. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=447.0s)]
*  I mean, there's Tulsi Gabbard today meeting with senators on Capitol Hill while the news is coming down that the butcher of Damascus has fled Syria and gone to Moscow. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=460.0s)]
*  And every one of those senators has to be looking Tulsi Gabbard up and down and thinking, oh, if this had happened one year from today, would Assad be going into exile here? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=471.0s)]
*  Would his best friend in America, Tulsi Gabbard, have us taking him in? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=484.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe under director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and President Donald Trump, Bashar al-Assad could split his exile time between here and Moscow. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=491.0s)]
*  All the old hands and sort of gray beards in American news and politics, particularly people with experience in national security and foreign policy, they will all tell you the same thing about the presidential transition period. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=504.0s)]
*  They will all tell you that the transition times between one president and the next, those are oftentimes when things go haywire. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=520.0s)]
*  And this transition is not proving to be a disappointment along those lines. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=530.0s)]
*  I mean, in the blink of an eye, we've had the government collapse in Germany. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=534.0s)]
*  We've had the government collapse in France. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=538.0s)]
*  We have had the imposition of martial law and an attempted overthrow of the government in South Korea. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=540.0s)]
*  We have had the toppling of the Assad regime and potentially a wholesale realignment of all the major powers in the Middle East, all while we are in between the end of one presidency and the beginning of another. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=546.0s)]
*  But don't worry, Elon Musk's mom is sitting in on the meetings. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=558.0s)]
*  And Jared just got both his ex-con dad and his college roommate really cool jobs. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=563.0s)]
*  And people have almost forgotten about the child sex trafficking attorney general nomination and the other guy supposedly selling presidential appointments and the rape allegation in the police report about the defense secretary nominee and the Unabomber fan for the explosives job. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=568.0s)]
*  And the health secretary who says a were made part of his brain and then died in there now asking potential hires into the U.S. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=583.0s)]
*  government how much they like sex and do they like to show off their bodies? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=591.0s)]
*  I mean, it is a complicated and dangerous world out there, especially right now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=596.0s)]
*  There is nothing about the quality of this presidential transition that should set anyone's mind at ease about how well America is going to be handling these matters. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=604.0s)]
*  But for us, all the more reason for us to try to understand them as best we can. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=616.0s)]
*  So hold that thought. We've got more. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=622.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfebw4RX0bg&t=626.0s)]
