# Lev Parnas tells his story, seeks redemption in new Maddow documentary, 'From Russia with Lev'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k)
*  I want to get right into it with the executive producer of From Russia with Lev, my colleague [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=0.0s)]
*  Rachel Maddow, who gets to add a new and important moniker to your to your resume. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=6.3s)]
*  You are the executive producer of this amazing documentary that we just watched. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=12.38s)]
*  Congratulations, first of all, my friend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=16.86s)]
*  Thank you, Ali. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=19.54s)]
*  It feels so great to have it out in the world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=20.54s)]
*  I have to just ask you, did you like it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Not only did I like it, I was set up not to like it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=25.72s)]
*  And I don't mean that for any other reason than, Lev's a complicated character. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=29.5s)]
*  And it's a very honest documentary about the complexity of Lev. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=35.38s)]
*  His wife talks about the complexity of Lev, Lev talks about the complexity of Lev. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=39.22s)]
*  You had, I believe, the first interview with him all those years ago. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=43.56s)]
*  So I wasn't sure what I wanted to know about Lev that I didn't already know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=48.82s)]
*  And you just stitched the whole thing together in a way that makes me wish I knew all this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  back then. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=58.3s)]
*  Yeah, you know, he it does matter that he is a very compelling person. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=59.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=65.46s)]
*  And you know, you can tell this story in lots of different ways. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=66.46s)]
*  You could tell the story from the perspective of Marie Yovanovitch, the ambassador who was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=69.14s)]
*  unjustly forced out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=73.74s)]
*  You could tell it from the perspective of Zelensky and the way that he was extorted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=74.94s)]
*  by Trump and the you know, the crime against Ukraine that was at the heart of the impeachment, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  which the sort of culminating thing here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  You could tell it from the perspective of Rudy Giuliani. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=85.66s)]
*  You could tell it from the perspective of Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=88.42s)]
*  But to tell it from the perspective of Lev, you get this guy who is obviously a very flawed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  person. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=95.1s)]
*  He's very open about the fact that he does have a background where he was a hustler. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=96.1s)]
*  He was involved with organized crime. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  He came up in that environment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=101.58s)]
*  You know, the whole reason that the characters like Tony Andre were going after him for years [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=104.02s)]
*  is because he had all these legal judgments and debts that people are trying to collect [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  from him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=112.1s)]
*  Definitely, you know, not a not a Boy Scout, but that's also part of the story. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  That's that's part of what's so amazing that he ended up in the White House, that he ended [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=118.94s)]
*  up being tasked to do something by the president of the United States. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=123.33999999999999s)]
*  And when you layer on top of that, what I believe is his genuine repentance and the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  fact that his phone has terabytes of evidence about what all these people did, it's just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=131.7s)]
*  it's unlike any other story that I know of from the whole Trump era or from any of my [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  time in covering politics. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=141.82s)]
*  The thing that makes this so great right from the beginning is the degree to which Lev [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  leans into the fact that he's a mob like character and in fact mob like characters and in some [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  cases actual mobsters were embedded in the Trump administration, which makes you wonder [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=153.38s)]
*  the conclusion I come to after watching this is who was really calling the shots during [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=159.18s)]
*  the Trump administration during this time that you cover? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=164.3s)]
*  Well, that's I mean, that is part of the worrying thing, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=167.62s)]
*  Like that's that's why it's a national it's not just a character flaw. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=170.38s)]
*  It's a national security problem when you've got criminals involved in the U.S. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=173.54s)]
*  government. When the crooks take over the White House, that's not just bad for the American [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=177.46s)]
*  people, but it's really good for the crooks because it means that anybody who's involved [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  with people they shouldn't be involved with, anybody who's involved in crimes also becomes [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=186.38s)]
*  susceptible to blackmail, to extortion, to doing all sorts of things that could pervert [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=190.34s)]
*  their work in what's supposed to be the public service. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=197.4s)]
*  And so it's really bad to have crooks in charge. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  And in this case, in Ukraine, the permeability of the White House, the fact that the guy who [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=203.62s)]
*  ran a nightclub called Mafia Rave in Ukraine had access to the president of the United [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=209.74s)]
*  States was seen as being a fantastic piece of news for the kinds of guys who would know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=216.46s)]
*  a guy who ran the Mafia Rave Club in Kiev. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=222.34s)]
*  It's those those sorts of characters shouldn't have access to the American president, to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=226.1s)]
*  the council, to the American president, to the State Department, to getting an ambassador [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=232.14s)]
*  fired who they wanted out of the way because she was anti-corruption. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=236.18s)]
*  I mean, those sorts of people shouldn't be able to do it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=239.06s)]
*  But that's how the Trump administration ran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  That was a moment in the documentary when Lev was relating the way in which he talked to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=243.38s)]
*  Donald Trump about Marie Yovanovitch being the problem, the U.S. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=250.26s)]
*  ambassador to Ukraine being the problem and needed to get rid of her and how literally [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=255.06s)]
*  Donald Trump looks over his shoulder and says, get rid of her. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  She's done. You can find a reason to get rid of her. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=261.82s)]
*  And you realize in that moment the power that people like Lev Parnas had in the Donald [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=264.14s)]
*  Trump circle. This is a real story about a fake story, essentially. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=269.86s)]
*  And Lev Parnas was involved in creating the fake story. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=275.38s)]
*  There's a point where he's sitting in the control room overseeing an interview with the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=278.86s)]
*  former Ukrainian minister of internal affairs, and he describes it very well as old Soviet [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  style state TV propaganda. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  You have spent so much time talking about the funnel of misinformation in America and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=290.82s)]
*  you've basically done a documentary about the funnel of misinformation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=295.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when Lev says at one point in the film, you know, I eventually realized [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=300.3s)]
*  that there wasn't anybody who fed us any piece of this story who wasn't either [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=306.9s)]
*  working for the Russian government directly or working for Russian intelligence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=312.94s)]
*  So this was this was a foreign influence operation to target the United States. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=316.78s)]
*  Right. The director of national intelligence has just said that Russia is is targeting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=321.78s)]
*  our elections again in 2024 to try to get Trump back in the White House as part of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=327.82s)]
*  their overall effort to try to harm and weaken the United States. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=332.62s)]
*  They're, you know, using their best weapon against the United States, which they think [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=335.82s)]
*  is Donald Trump in power there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=339.82s)]
*  So they're doing it now. That's why we've seen all these indictments, for example, from [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=341.5s)]
*  the Justice Department in recent days. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=345.46s)]
*  Famously, we all remember what they did in 2016 to try to get Trump in power with the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=347.26s)]
*  troll farms and the WikiLeaks and the hacking the Democratic Party and the Clinton [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=352.54s)]
*  campaign and all that stuff. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=357.18s)]
*  Well, that's 2016 and 2024. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=358.46s)]
*  In between, in 2020, what they did was love. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=361.02s)]
*  What they did was this project to create a story that would hopefully knock Joe Biden [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=363.74s)]
*  out of the running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 because Donald [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=371.26s)]
*  Trump knew that Biden had the best chance of beating him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=376.5s)]
*  And so he wanted him out. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=379.7s)]
*  And so they ran the Russians ran an influence operation to try to essentially spoil Joe [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=380.98s)]
*  Biden's chances at winning that that nomination. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=388.14s)]
*  And they they went at him by what they thought was his Achilles heel, which is his love for [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=391.06s)]
*  his son, Hunter, his troubled son, Hunter, and using that using a father's love for his [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=395.7s)]
*  son against him, I think is I think is morally repugnant. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=401.09999999999997s)]
*  I think it's evil, but it also was really consequential both in Hunter's life and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  ultimately in the Biden family's life. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  And it led to the first Trump impeachment. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=410.82s)]
*  It led to the change in love's life and him going to prison and all of this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  But that was the origin of it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=416.7s)]
*  In a few minutes, I'm going to talk to Lev and his wife, central characters in the show. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=418.42s)]
*  These documentaries don't work without central characters. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=424.06s)]
*  As you mentioned, you can tell it from different perspectives. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  But when you tell it from too many perspectives, you lose the effect of the story. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=428.94s)]
*  So Parnas is the central character in the story. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=432.46000000000004s)]
*  He frames himself as the con man who got conned at the same time. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=435.66s)]
*  As we discussed, he really did help orchestrate this whole operation. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=441.06s)]
*  So, yes, I know where I stand on this, having watched this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=444.7s)]
*  But for the viewer, why should they believe Lev Parnas now? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=449.42s)]
*  It's a very good question, totally fair question and one that we had to confront and that I [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=455.02s)]
*  had long conversations with Billy Corbin and Alfred Spellman, who are the director and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=459.62s)]
*  the producer of the film that rock and tour pictures. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=463.53999999999996s)]
*  We talked about this a lot because that's core to the journalistic import of the film. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=465.58s)]
*  Can you believe what he is saying? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=469.62s)]
*  And there's there's two things that I think powerful, maybe three things, but two main [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=471.7s)]
*  things that that powerfully, I think, come down on the side of believing what Lev is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=475.5s)]
*  saying. One of them is that first interview that he did with me in January 2020, which [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=480.14s)]
*  set this whole process in motion. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=485.1s)]
*  When I mean, you know how this works, Ali, when when when somebody gets arrested and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  somebody gets indicted, the one thing you can be damn sure they are not going to do [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=495.42s)]
*  next is appear on television doing an interview with a real journalist. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=499.9s)]
*  Right. And yet after Lev was arrested and indicted, he came and did that interview [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=504.82s)]
*  with me at great legal peril to himself. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=510.78s)]
*  The Justice Department actually tried to remand him to custody because he did that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=513.54s)]
*  interview with me. It was not all of his sort of come to Jesus. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=519.02s)]
*  Here's what I know. Let me testify. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=523.86s)]
*  Let me tell you what I know. Let me show you what's on my phone. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=525.62s)]
*  All of that stuff was not only not in his own interest, it was against his interest [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  directly and may have very well led to a lot of the legal peril that he found himself [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=532.42s)]
*  in. It was not self-interested. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=537.14s)]
*  And I find that important. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=538.5799999999999s)]
*  The incentives all went the other way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=540.14s)]
*  The other part of it is that he really does have a record of all of the things that he's [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=541.5s)]
*  talking about. He's got thousands and thousands and thousands of text messages, thousands [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=546.38s)]
*  of documents in his iCloud, thousands of photos. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=552.34s)]
*  And he just gave us full access to all of that to make this film, which was the most [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=555.58s)]
*  amazing fact checking process I've ever sort of been through for a guy who has such an [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=561.4200000000001s)]
*  incredible story to tell about such important people. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=565.38s)]
*  We watched together a powerful moment at the end of the film. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=568.7s)]
*  And now that it's out there, we can talk about the end of the film where Lev Parnas [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=572.62s)]
*  finally meets Hunter Biden. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=576.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. How did that come together? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=580.0600000000001s)]
*  So we had a totally different ending plan for the film. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=583.34s)]
*  And in his final interview, there was the series of interviews with Lev that made the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  sort of core of the film. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  And in his final interview, he said to director Billy Corbin, you know, I am going to go to [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=596.02s)]
*  my probation officer and ask for permission to leave the state of Florida because I would [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=602.14s)]
*  like to go to California and apologize to Hunter Biden face to face. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=607.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=611.22s)]
*  Billy was like, yeah, OK, sure. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=611.94s)]
*  I want a pony, you know, like, I know that you want that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=614.34s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's going to happen. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=616.86s)]
*  But Lev made it happen. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=618.34s)]
*  He figured out how to contact Hunter Biden. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=619.46s)]
*  He asked him. He said, listen, I'm doing this documentary. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=622.14s)]
*  I would like to apologize to you face to face. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=625.02s)]
*  You do not have to say yes, but would you consider it? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=627.14s)]
*  And if so, can I bring a camera? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=629.46s)]
*  And none of us believed it would. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=631.46s)]
*  I didn't even bother putting it on my calendar. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=633.74s)]
*  I never thought it would happen. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=635.54s)]
*  And then it just did. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=636.9s)]
*  And we didn't know when Lev walked in that room whether Hunter was going to, you know, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=639.54s)]
*  punch him out or or talk to him or accept his offer, his forgiveness and accept his [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=644.58s)]
*  apology. And it was just a really remarkable moment given what Lev was the author of in [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=649.82s)]
*  Hunter's life. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_tVros135k&t=655.5s)]
