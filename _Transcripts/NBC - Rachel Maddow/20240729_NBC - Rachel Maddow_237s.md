# Maddow: Desire to please billionaires leads Trump to embarrassing flip-flops
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8)
*  Don't forget that in addition to everything else going on for Donald Trump right now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=0.0s)]
*  he does owe hundreds of millions of dollars in civil fraud penalties, thanks to what he [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=3.92s)]
*  and his business got caught doing in New York State. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=9.24s)]
*  As he embarks on yet another presidential run, a third presidential run, with that personal [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=12.44s)]
*  financial disgrace and pressure looming over him, he has gravitated more than you might [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=19.16s)]
*  even expect and more than he even has in the past to very eccentric, very right wing billionaires, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=27.12s)]
*  both for financial support and interestingly, to tell him what to do, which he has then [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=33.04s)]
*  done directly to now repeatedly embarrassing effect. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=38.68s)]
*  So for example, Trump used to call Bitcoin and cryptocurrency a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=44.72s)]
*  He said he was quote, not a fan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=52.0s)]
*  He said crypto and Bitcoin were quote, based on thin air. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=54.44s)]
*  Well now, after meeting with crypto lobbyists, he says he's going to make America the crypto capital of the planet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=59.44s)]
*  Trump was against TikTok. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=69.0s)]
*  Trump was so against TikTok, he tried to ban it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=72.36s)]
*  Then he met with a billionaire who has a big stake in TikTok, and now he is a champion of TikTok. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=76.24s)]
*  Trump promoted the right wing boycott of Budweiser, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=83.04s)]
*  Budweiser, oh, they're so left wing, which is insane in the first place. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=86.56s)]
*  But that was the thing for the right, and Trump promoted those boycotts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=91.04s)]
*  Then an Anheuser-Busch lobbyist threw him a fundraiser, and Trump did a total 180. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=94.48s)]
*  We should all be buying Budweiser now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=98.92s)]
*  Now it's electric vehicles. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Trump has been railing against electric vehicles for years and really intensely for months now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Remember, it was part of his weird rambling, never ending speech at the RNC that there's an electric vehicle mandate, which there isn't. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=111.08s)]
*  And he's going to free us from the fake electric vehicle mandate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=119.2s)]
*  He'll allow Americans to have gas cars again since Joe Biden banned gas cars. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=123.24s)]
*  Again, this is not a true thing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=128.6s)]
*  He was saying about Joe Biden or about there being any mandate about electric cars. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=131.12s)]
*  But he has been on this riff for months about how electric cars are terrible and he will free us from the tyranny of electric cars. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=135.6s)]
*  Except now he's just realized that this might make for an awkward relationship with Elon Musk, who is occasionally the richest man in this country and who owns a large electric car company. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=143.56s)]
*  Once Elon Musk reneged a few days ago of what the Wall Street Journal had said would be a 45 million dollar a month donation pledge to Trump. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=154.04s)]
*  Trump has never started talking about how much he loves electric vehicles, how he drives them, how they're incredible, how they're so great. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=163.88s)]
*  And, you know, you do that once. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=175.84s)]
*  OK, maybe you evolved or maybe it's a coincidence or maybe you just got old and confused and forgot your previous stance. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=178.2s)]
*  But it's everything now. It's on everything. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=185.96s)]
*  Like, pick a topic. Trump takes position, meets billionaire who has opposite position. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=188.4s)]
*  Trump then adopts opposite position. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=193.72s)]
*  It just happens over and over and over again. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  Somebody should pretend to be like a billionaire who hates licorice. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=198.4s)]
*  Get Trump to meet an I hate licorice billionaire. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=202.52s)]
*  See how long it takes for Trump to start railing about the evil of Twizzlers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=205.76s)]
*  He's going to ban licorice, make America whatever again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGaItaXE7e8&t=211.56s)]
