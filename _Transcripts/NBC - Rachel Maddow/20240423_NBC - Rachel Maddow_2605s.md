# Trump on trial: New York vs. Donald Trump Day 5 Highlights
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk)
*  I was at the courthouse today in Manhattan. I was in the courtroom for opening statements for this first criminal trial of the former president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=0.0s)]
*  I can report firsthand that the courtroom smells like old soup and stale breath. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=8.0s)]
*  I can report that the police officers who police the courtroom are working very hard and they appear to be very stressed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=14.0s)]
*  I can report that Judge Murchon is soft-spoken and has what I think would be universally considered to be a pleasant voice. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=21.0s)]
*  I can report that prosecutor Matthew Colangelo speaks exactly like Seth Meyers speaks when Seth Meyers is not telling jokes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=29.0s)]
*  I can tell you that the first witness, David Pecker, accidentally gave out his whole phone number today when the prosecutor just asked him to confirm the last four digits. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=38.0s)]
*  He was trying to remember the last four digits and in order to get there in his head, he said the whole number out loud and oops, didn't mean to do that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=47.0s)]
*  I can report that former President Donald Trump looks a lot older than he used to and that it seemed to me in my subjective take that he seemed miserable to be there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=54.0s)]
*  But you know, I look a lot older than I used to look as well and I think anybody's got a right to look miserable when they're sitting in a courtroom charged with dozens of felonies as a criminal defendant. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=67.0s)]
*  The courtroom is bare bones. It is not large. It is inelegant. It has unflattering lighting. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=78.0s)]
*  Like I said, it does not smell good and everybody is very tense. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=86.0s)]
*  What I mean to present to you with all of this information is that given the choice, nobody would want to be there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=91.0s)]
*  Except, of course, journalists and reporters covering the most historic trial in American political history. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=99.0s)]
*  To that end, I'd also like to say that I'm sorry to the journalists who are sitting immediately next to me because I unintentionally snorted out loud and went, oh, when this happened today at the trial and when I read this part of the transcript, you will know why I said, oh, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=105.0s)]
*  In January 2017, before the defendant moved down to Washington to begin his presidency, Michael Cohen met with Allen Weisselberg of the Trump Organization to talk about how Cohen was going to get reimbursed for the payoff to Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=125.0s)]
*  Weisselberg, you will remember, was the Trump Organization chief financial officer, and he was one of the defendant's longest serving and most trusted employees. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=139.0s)]
*  Neither Trump nor the Trump Organization could just write a check to Michael Cohen for $130,000 with a memo line that said reimbursement for porn star payoff. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=147.0s)]
*  They had to disguise the nature of the repayment, so they agreed to cook the books and make it look like the repayment was actually income. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=158.0s)]
*  Payments for services rendered instead of a reimbursement. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=166.0s)]
*  Allen Weisselberg asked Mr. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=170.0s)]
*  Cohen to bring a copy of a bank statement showing the $130,000 payment that Cohen had made to keep Stormy Daniels quiet before the election. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=171.56s)]
*  Weisselberg and Cohen agreed to a total repayment amount of $420,000. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=180.0s)]
*  Here is how they got to that number. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=185.0s)]
*  This is good. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=187.0s)]
*  They started with $130,000 that Trump owed Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payoff. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=189.0s)]
*  Then they added $50,000 for a separate reimbursement Cohen was claiming, which had to do with tech services he paid for during the campaign. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=194.0s)]
*  That adds up to $180,000. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=203.0s)]
*  Then they agreed to double that amount to $360,000 to account for taxes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=206.0s)]
*  Now, of course, if Trump was just reimbursing Cohen, there was no need to gross it up for taxes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=212.0s)]
*  They doubled it because their plan was to call it income instead of a reimbursement. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=217.0s)]
*  If Cohen was getting money, they were calling income. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=222.0s)]
*  He would have to pay taxes on it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=225.0s)]
*  Cohen was close to a 50% tax bracket. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=226.0s)]
*  So to make him whole on the $180,000 that the defendant owed him, they had to double the amount to $360,000. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=229.0s)]
*  Then he had added another $60,000 as a year end bonus. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=236.0s)]
*  And all of that comes out to a total of $420,000. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=241.0s)]
*  And Allen Weisselberg wrote all of that down. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=246.0s)]
*  Whereupon, I annoyed the people sitting near me because I snorted out loud and said, oh, he wrote it all down. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=250.0s)]
*  If you were a fan of a wire, this is the scene where Stringer Bell turns to the young man and says, are you taking notes on a criminal conspiracy? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=256.0s)]
*  Using a lot of swear words. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=264.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, he was taking notes on a criminal conspiracy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=267.0s)]
*  Prosecutor Michael Matthew Colangelo. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=270.0s)]
*  Allen Weisselberg wrote all of that down. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=273.0s)]
*  The you can't believe this is real. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=277.0s)]
*  The bank statement that I told you about that he asked Cohen to bring to their meeting, the bank statement from the Essential Consultants account, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=282.0s)]
*  which showed the $130,000 wire that Cohen had made to Keith Davidson to keep Stormy Daniels quiet. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=289.0s)]
*  You will see in this trial, Allen Weisselberg's handwriting down the side of that bank statement, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=294.0s)]
*  laying out every one of the steps that I just described, showing how they converted the $130,000 payoff amount to the $420,000 that Cohen was going to get paid back as a grossed up way to disguise it, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=300.0s)]
*  not as reimbursement, but as income. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=311.0s)]
*  And they took notes about it every step of the way. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=313.0s)]
*  And the prosecution has the notes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=316.0s)]
*  And then here's the kicker. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=319.0s)]
*  Matthew Colangelo, prosecutor, quote, Cohen and Weisselberg then met with Trump, who approved the repayment amount of $420,000 on the $130,000. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=321.0s)]
*  Stormy Daniels' payment and a few other expenses. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=329.0s)]
*  Now, you will see evidence at trial that Trump was a very frugal businessman. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=332.0s)]
*  He believed in pinching pennies. He believed in watching every dollar. He believed in negotiating every bill. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=337.0s)]
*  It's all over all of the books he has written. He ran the Trump Organization with total control. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=342.0s)]
*  You will hear testimony about his relentless focus on the bottom line. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=346.0s)]
*  But when it came time to pay Michael Cohen back for the catch and kill deal, you will see that he didn't negotiate the price down. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=349.0s)]
*  He doubled it and he doubled it so they could disguise it as income. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=355.0s)]
*  And you will hear evidence that the Trump Organization was not in the practice of paying people twice what they owed for anything. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=360.0s)]
*  This might be the only time that ever happened. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=366.0s)]
*  And Trump's willingness to do so here shows just how important it was to him to hide the true nature of Cohen's illegal payment to Ms. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=369.0s)]
*  Daniels and the overall election conspiracy that they had launched in August 2015. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=376.0s)]
*  You will hear prosecutors saying Trump is paying a lot for this and he never pays for anything. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=383.0s)]
*  That's how important and sensitive this was. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=388.0s)]
*  Now, interestingly, moments later, the defense used this same set of facts to make the opposite point to the jury saying, yeah, Trump really is so cheap and so unwilling to pay for anything. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=391.0s)]
*  So this must have been some other thing he was paying for. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=404.0s)]
*  And that's not the thing they have handwritten notes from his CFO about. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=408.0s)]
*  Joining us now is former FBI General Counsel Andrew Weissman, also with us, former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Katherine Christian. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=413.0s)]
*  Katherine and Andrew, thank you both for being here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=421.0s)]
*  Andrew, let me ask you first, was Stringer Bell right to ask Allen Wesselberg, are you taking notes on a criminal conspiracy? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=423.0s)]
*  Is this document potentially important here? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=430.0s)]
*  So you must have seen my notes because that is starred. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=433.0s)]
*  That was the page where I had the same reaction. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=437.0s)]
*  So one of the things that you listen for when you listen to openings on both sides is you know that there are witnesses who are going to testify and you think about how they're going to do, whether they have memory issues, whether they have credibility issues. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=441.0s)]
*  But then you look for what is the prosecution going to say with respect to what's so-called hard evidence? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=454.0s)]
*  And there, the things that stood out to me was you had a reference to the tape recording that we've heard about. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=460.0s)]
*  That's where Donald Trump is overheard saying, hey, let's just pay the hundred and thirty thousand in cash. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=466.0s)]
*  That's that's a terrible tape for Donald Trump. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=472.0s)]
*  Second, there was references to telephone records at a critical time that the payments were first made by Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=475.0s)]
*  Were there two calls that the prosecutor referenced between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=486.0s)]
*  And then the third was this, which is definitely a fall off your chair moment where they have it in writing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=493.0s)]
*  And what's so interesting is that the defense said the repayment was not it was not reimbursement for the payments to Stormy Daniels. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=500.0s)]
*  I do not know how they're going to deal with that when you have these notes. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=511.0s)]
*  And remember, when you make a promise, when you say something at openings, as Catherine knows, as Katie knows, that comes back to haunt you. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=516.0s)]
*  If you have over promised, if you've made a misstatement that both sides are listening for that because they're going to bring it up again in closing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=525.0s)]
*  Catherine, is it is it important here that we don't expect Alan Weisselberg himself to be a witness to potentially walk the jury through what his notes meant and explain this document that is otherwise sort of a fall off your chair moment? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=533.0s)]
*  Like Andrew said, well, it's a good thing since he's serving time for perjury. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=548.0s)]
*  So neither side wants him as a witness. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=553.0s)]
*  So it's it's very good for the prosecution because they can just have the notes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=556.0s)]
*  And obviously, Donald Trump doesn't want a perjurer testifying on his behalf. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=561.0s)]
*  So that's a good thing. But I agree with with Andrew. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=565.0s)]
*  This is the corroboration when you talk about Michael Cohen in his baggage. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=569.0s)]
*  This is where you have corroboration of his statement. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=573.0s)]
*  So there's no way the Manhattan D.A.'s office would have just relied on Michael Cohen's testimony if they did not have corroborating documents, corroborating witnesses. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=577.0s)]
*  Now, as Lawrence O'Donnell just mentioned today was the first time that we've heard from the defense. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=586.0s)]
*  We've heard from the prosecution, in effect, with the indictment, with the announcement of charges that led to today's proceedings. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=593.0s)]
*  But this is the first time we got to see the defense go through their paces. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=601.0s)]
*  For the defense counsel for former President Trump, we did get a sense in their opening statements today about how it looks like they're going to try to defend their client. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=606.0s)]
*  If today's opening statements are any guide, they're going to stress that Mr. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=614.0s)]
*  Trump is a former president and they're going to always call him President Trump. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=619.0s)]
*  They are going to stress beyond that, that he right now is the presumptive Republican nominee for president again, or as his defense counsel called him today, the Republican nominee, not even presumptive. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=623.0s)]
*  They're going to claim that every aspect of this was an innocent act by Trump, that there wasn't an underlying sexual encounter to cover up, even though that would seem to be immaterial to the charges. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=634.0s)]
*  They will seem to be claiming again, if today's opening statements are any guide, that Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, paid a porn star on his own accord and for his own reasons that Trump only paid Michael Cohen for legal services, just like he always had. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=646.0s)]
*  He just changed to a weird new way of paying him after the porn star thing because, well, they'll think of something. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=662.0s)]
*  But if you were in this defense team, if you were in charge of coming up with a defense for Mr. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=670.0s)]
*  Trump, here's the part of the prosecution's case that would seem to be the most difficult thing to explain logically. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=675.0s)]
*  If you're really going to try to mount a defense that Trump did nothing at all wrong, that there was no conspiracy to corrupt the election, as the prosecution put it at the top of their opening statements today, well, this would seem to be the toughest thing logically that you're up against. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=682.0s)]
*  Here it is. This is from the opening statement from prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. Colangelo. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=700.0s)]
*  Quote. Now with this, oh, sorry, this is not quoting it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=705.0s)]
*  Forgive me. This is the introduction. At this point, Colangelo has explained to the jury that there was what he called a criminal conspiracy between Trump and AMI American media to publish positive stories about Trump, to publish negative stories about Trump's rivals, to find negative stories about Trump that hadn't been published yet, and then to pay the sources of the stories to make them shut up and not tell anybody about those stories before the election. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=709.0s)]
*  So the prosecution has explained to the jury at this point that AMI American media, National Enquirer, they first found a doorman, a doorman named Dino, Dino Sejudin, who said that Trump had fathered a secret child with a housekeeper. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=733.0s)]
*  Sejudin was the first one that AMI paid to keep quiet about his story. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=748.0s)]
*  Then there was a second one, a woman named Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=753.0s)]
*  They paid her to not tell anybody about that story as well. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=757.0s)]
*  Then there was the third one, Stormy Daniels, and although by this point the Enquirer was still willing to make arrangements for her to be paid to be quiet about that story, by that point they were not ready to put up additional money. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=760.0s)]
*  And so Michael Cohen put up the money for that. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=773.0s)]
*  So the prosecutors explained all this to the jury, and then he says this, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo, quote, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=776.0s)]
*  Now look, no politician wants bad press, but the evidence at trial will show that this was not spin or communication strategy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=790.0s)]
*  This was a planned, coordinated, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures, to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior, using doctored corporate records and bank forms to conceal those payments along the way. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=798.0s)]
*  It was election fraud, pure and simple. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=815.0s)]
*  We will never know, and it doesn't matter if this conspiracy was the difference maker in a close election. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=818.0s)]
*  But you will see evidence in the defendant's own words from his social media posts, from the speeches at campaign rallies and other events. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=824.0s)]
*  You will see in his own words, making crystal clear that he was certainly concerned about how all of this could hurt his standing with voters and with female voters in particular. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=833.0s)]
*  You will also see evidence that on election night, as news outlets got closer to calling the election for Donald Trump, the lawyer for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougall texted Dylan Howard, an editor at the National Enquirer, and he said, quote, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=841.0s)]
*  What have we done? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=856.0s)]
*  And about a month after the election, David Pecker, the CEO of American Media, then authorized AMI to release both Dino Sucudin, the doorman, and Karen McDougall from their nondisclosure agreements. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=859.0s)]
*  Say that again. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=874.0s)]
*  About a month after the election, Pecker authorized AMI to release the first two recipients of catch-and-kill money, release them from their nondisclosure agreements once the election was over. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=875.0s)]
*  Colangelo, quote. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=888.0s)]
*  So having paid for the stories in order to keep them from the public before election day, Pecker and AMI then told both McDougall and Sucudin a month after the election that they were no longer bound by the nondisclosure agreements. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=889.0s)]
*  So just think about what that means. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=901.0s)]
*  This claim, right, from the defense is that none of these payment schemes had anything to do with the election. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=904.0s)]
*  Who knows what Michael Cohen was doing paying that porn star? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=910.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was just paying for legal fees, right? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=913.0s)]
*  The defense is saying this had nothing to do with the election. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=915.0s)]
*  The prosecution says they will present evidence that Trump and American media paid for all of these people to be silent until the election was over. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=918.0s)]
*  And then once the election was over, they then released all these people from these agreements to be silent because once the election happened, they didn't care anymore because at that point, mission accomplished because the mission was to influence the election. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=926.0s)]
*  And so once the election was done, there's no more need for these agreements. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=942.0s)]
*  The mission was the election. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=946.0s)]
*  The mission was not to protect his brand. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=948.0s)]
*  The mission wasn't to save his family embarrassment. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=951.0s)]
*  It was to keep these people silent, to pay them to be silent specifically and only in order to win the election full stop. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=954.0s)]
*  The prosecution calls this a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election, one that was covered up by lying in these business records. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=964.0s)]
*  Logically, releasing people from the agreements once the election was over, logically, that would seem to be the crux of this case if the prosecution can prove it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=973.0s)]
*  Legally, though, we'll see. Lawrence? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=985.0s)]
*  So, Rachel, here we arrive at the different burdens of prosecution and defense. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=989.0s)]
*  The prosecution is going for logic and you are following their logic and their logic takes you over to the National Enquirer and it takes you over to this guy who said told the choir that, you know, Trump fathered a child. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=995.0s)]
*  That turns out not to be true. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1009.0s)]
*  Everyone in the courtroom agrees that that wasn't true. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1011.0s)]
*  And then it takes you over to Karen McDougal and those are the two who are released from their confidentiality agreement after the election. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1014.0s)]
*  And what the defense is going to say in final argument is that has nothing to do with this case. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1021.0s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1027.0s)]
*  Because remember what the defense needs in final argument is not logic. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1030.0s)]
*  They're not trying to take you through a flawlessly logical story. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1034.0s)]
*  They're just trying to tug at any little doubt. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1038.0s)]
*  They can find anywhere and they will lean in final argument on that agreement in that courtroom that that guy who said who told the inquirer that Donald Trump illegitimately fathered a child was not telling the truth. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1042.0s)]
*  Wasn't telling the truth. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1057.0s)]
*  Just like Stormy Daniels wasn't telling the truth about Donald Trump. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1058.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump gets hustled by these people all the time and we have to deal with them in different ways. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1062.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has said publicly. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1066.0s)]
*  This happens to every man, every man, includes you Chris Hayes sitting at this table, every man who's public, every man who's in the public eye is constantly paying off tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of these deals all the time. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1068.0s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's claim. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1086.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1088.0s)]
*  And he's going to say, you know, this was happening to me all the time. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1089.0s)]
*  And and and all of that McDougal stuff, everything involving pecker, everything involving the inquirer is going to be thrown out the door in the final argument of Donald Trump's defense lawyers because none of that is a charged crime. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1091.0s)]
*  Not a single thing in any of that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1104.0s)]
*  It's these business records and the other piece of the defense that we heard today about the business records is this is the name of the woman who made up, you know, the checks. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1106.0s)]
*  This is the name of the bookkeeper centered in the record who filled out the forms. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1117.0s)]
*  This is the name of the person who told her to say legal services. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1122.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump never told any of them to say legal services. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1126.0s)]
*  That's the defense. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1130.0s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't tell them to keep the books this way. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1131.0s)]
*  And the money, oh, by the way, was not for having anything to do with Stormy Daniels. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1134.0s)]
*  That's the entire defense. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1139.0s)]
*  There's no other piece of the defense and it has nothing to do with other people's, you know, non-disclosure agreements and all that stuff. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1140.0s)]
*  And and of course, all of that stuff makes perfect sense when a prosecution is building you this flawless table that has logical for logical legs to it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1149.0s)]
*  Defense is going to come along and say, no, it has no legs. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1161.0s)]
*  The table has no legs. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1164.0s)]
*  We released all these people from these agreements after the election because we love late November. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1167.0s)]
*  And that's the time when we release everyone from their Christmas. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1173.0s)]
*  It's a time of very feel no need. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1176.0s)]
*  The defense will feel no need to explain at all why those non-disclosure agreements are no longer enforceable. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1178.0s)]
*  They won't have any need to when they're in their final argument. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1185.0s)]
*  They'll throw something out there in the course of the trial, but they won't feel compelled to explain what you're talking about. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1188.0s)]
*  So you're talking about about the claim from Dino the doorman being a false claim. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1193.0s)]
*  What am I nevertheless agreed to pay for it and what Michael Cohen was paid and how they arrived at that amount was the snort your coffee out your nose in the courtroom moment today. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1198.0s)]
*  We're going to talk about that, including with Andrew Weissman and Katherine Christian, who are here, who are keeping us on the on the legal straight and narrow as we as we proceed with our primetime recap. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1211.0s)]
*  Today's criminal proceedings against former president Donald Trump. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1222.0s)]
*  OK, question from the prosecutor. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1237.0s)]
*  So as CEO and president and chairman, did you have the final say over publishing decisions, including which stories would get published and which stories would not get published? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1240.0s)]
*  Answer from David Pecker, former CEO of American Media. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1249.0s)]
*  Yes, I had the final say on the celebrity side of the magazine industry, at least on the tabloid side. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1253.0s)]
*  We used checkbook journalism and we pay for stories. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1259.0s)]
*  So I gave a number to the editors that they could not spend more than ten thousand dollars to investigate or produce or publish a story. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1263.0s)]
*  So anything over ten thousand dollars that they would spend on a story that would have to be vetted and brought up to me if they were going to spend more for approval. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1271.0s)]
*  Question prosecutor, in addition to having to approve expenditures, did you also have final kind of editorial say, in other words, the ability to determine that a particular story was not going to be run or a particular story was going to be run? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1280.0s)]
*  Answer David Pecker. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1294.0s)]
*  Being in the publishing industry for 40 years, I realized early in my career that the only thing that was important is the cover of a magazine. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1295.0s)]
*  So when the editors produce a story or prepare the cover, we would have a meeting and they would present to me what the story would be, what the concept was, what the cost was going to be. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1304.0s)]
*  Question prosecutor. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1311.0s)]
*  And if the story involved, I guess for lack of a better way to say it, a big story or a famous person, did you have the final say on whether or not to publish that story? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1312.0s)]
*  Answer David Pecker. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1321.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1323.0s)]
*  The first witness in the criminal trial of former President Donald Trump today was David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1325.0s)]
*  AMI, which is the company that used to own the National Enquirer. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1333.0s)]
*  Now, two salient points here about that testimony from David Pecker. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1337.0s)]
*  He's only on the stand for like half an hour today, but we get all of this very salient stuff for the prosecution's case. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1341.0s)]
*  First of all, there's there's what he said about what counts as a normal amount of money for the kind of checkbook journalism that he says his company does anything over ten thousand dollars. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1348.0s)]
*  That would be unusual. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1360.0s)]
*  That would be sort of out of bounds that would have to get personal approval from him as the chairman president and CEO of not just one of these publications, but the entire company with dozens of publications. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1361.0s)]
*  Ten grand was the ceiling. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1373.0s)]
*  Beyond that, it had to go personally through him. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1374.0s)]
*  But in this case, prosecutors say they will present evidence that AMI was doing something in a whole other league when it came to what they were doing for Trump. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1377.0s)]
*  For example, before even investigating a Trump property doorman's claim about Trump supposedly fathering a secret child with a housekeeper, they paid that man thirty thousand dollars. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1386.0s)]
*  They paid the man making the claim thirty thousand dollars to make him be quiet about it before they even investigated whether it might be true. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1399.0s)]
*  Triple what is their normal limit for having to go to the CEO? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1408.0s)]
*  Also, the claim about the affair with Trump from former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1414.0s)]
*  They paid her one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which was fifteen times their limit for going to the CEO and appears to have been way beyond what they were paying anybody else for anything. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1419.0s)]
*  Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo, quote, After consulting with Cohen, Pecker directed his editor in chief at the National Enquirer to negotiate an agreement to pay thirty thousand dollars to the doorman to buy exclusive rights to that story. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1432.0s)]
*  The evidence will show that Pecker was not acting as a publisher. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1446.0s)]
*  He was acting as a co-conspirator. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1449.0s)]
*  The evidence will show that this was a highly unusual deal, even for tabloid journalism. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1452.0s)]
*  It was a lot more money than they would usually pay to a source. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1457.0s)]
*  They bought the doorman story without even fully investigating it. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1461.0s)]
*  It was the first time David Pecker had ever paid anyone for information about Donald Trump. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1464.0s)]
*  But Pecker directed that the deal take place because of the agreement he had reached and because he had promised Trump at the Trump Tower meeting in August 2015 that he would use his media empire to help the defendants campaign. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1470.0s)]
*  And they knew that public disclosure of the doorman's information would hurt that campaign. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1482.0s)]
*  So what prosecutors laid out today and what the witness helped them prove today is that the practices described here in this alleged criminal conspiracy were not at all normal, not even for tabloid checkbook journalism that pays for stories. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1487.0s)]
*  And even for American media specifically and the National Enquirer specifically, this is not their bag. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1503.0s)]
*  This is not part of what they do as a magazine. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1510.0s)]
*  This is part of what they do as an alleged criminal conspiracy with Donald Trump to illegally influence the election. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1513.0s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1520.0s)]
*  The second and final part about this David Pecker testimony that is perhaps salient to the overall case here is the part where he says that the quote only thing that's important is the cover of a magazine. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1522.0s)]
*  Stepping back from just the legal fight here, if this was a criminal conspiracy to influence the election, how much influence are we talking about here in terms of how much influence this alleged criminal conspiracy could have had on the election? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1535.0s)]
*  Well, how influential is the National Enquirer? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1549.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1552.0s)]
*  I mean, the National Enquirer only reportedly has about 150,000, 200,000 copies sold nationwide in a week these days. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1553.0s)]
*  But the covers, the covers are the only thing that matters. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1561.0s)]
*  They have their covers in the face of everyone who shops in a mainstream grocery store anywhere in America in all 50 states. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1565.0s)]
*  The cover of the National Enquirer per David Pecker, the only thing that matters is the cover of the National Enquirer. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1574.0s)]
*  The cover of the National Enquirer per David Pecker, the only thing that matters, the covers of that magazine from the time of this alleged criminal conspiracy with Trump, the covers that were in your face in every supermarket in the country week after week and for months on end looked like this. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1580.0s)]
*  Trump, why I am the only choice for president. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1598.0s)]
*  The Donald Trump, nobody knows the babes and bucks. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1602.0s)]
*  The real reason he hates Obama and the Clintons. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1607.0s)]
*  This one has a special place in my heart. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1611.0s)]
*  Putin picks Trump for president. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1613.0s)]
*  Or this one, how Trump will win or following how Trump will win the debate. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1616.0s)]
*  Also, Hillary's nephew is in the Klan. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1622.0s)]
*  Trump takes charge. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1626.0s)]
*  Also, Bill Clinton is dying. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1628.0s)]
*  And Hillary is dying. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1631.0s)]
*  And also Hillary is corrupt. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1634.0s)]
*  That one's not clear enough. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1637.0s)]
*  It just says corrupt. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1639.0s)]
*  It's one big word. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1640.0s)]
*  Also, Hillary will never be president. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1641.0s)]
*  And this was their election E of bombshell edition. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1643.0s)]
*  Just make sure you hit all the bases here. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1647.0s)]
*  Hillary corrupt racist criminal. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1649.0s)]
*  Before 2016, the National Enquirer never before endorsed a presidential candidate. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1653.0s)]
*  But this is what they did in 2016. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1660.0s)]
*  When they did those covers, they were doing something very different with Donald Trump than they had ever done with any politician before. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1663.0s)]
*  Something that was in the face of every person who ever walked up to the little conveyor belt thing at a supermarket checkout line anywhere in America. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1671.0s)]
*  Anytime during the duration of the alleged conspiracy, which was the duration of the 2016 campaign, whether or not you ever picked up that magazine, let alone opened it past the cover. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1680.0s)]
*  This propaganda, which was the product of this allegedly illegal campaign scheme, was in the face of likely if not tens of millions of Americans, perhaps more than 100 million Americans. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1690.0s)]
*  How many of us go to a grocery store? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1705.0s)]
*  This was straight a strange out of character first time ever arrangement they made with this one candidate with Trump that prosecutors today in their opening statement said was a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election, a criminal scheme that was hatched in a Trump Tower meeting just a few weeks after he announced his candidacy for president. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1708.0s)]
*  A criminal scheme which ultimately landed him in criminal court today as the first ever U.S. president to be a defendant in a criminal trial when the cover up of that alleged criminal conspiracy, which charged as a string of 34 felonies in New York state. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1727.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyer, defense counsel Todd Blanch was in the middle of his opening statements today when something unusual happened. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1743.0s)]
*  Todd Blanch, Trump defense counsel, quote, Michael Cohen paying Stormy Daniels or Stephanie Clifford $130,000 in exchange for her agreeing to not publicly spread false claims about President Trump is not illegal. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1751.0s)]
*  I'm going to say that again entering into a non disclosure agreement prosecutor objection judge sustained Mr Blanch entering into a non disclosure agreement is perfectly legal prosecution objection. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1766.0s)]
*  The judge overruled Mr Blanch then continues on for a moment. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1781.0s)]
*  Then it happens again pretty much right away. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1786.0s)]
*  Todd Blanch when Ms Daniels threatened to go public with her false claim of a sexual encounter with President Trump back in 2008 that it was as the people just said very close to the election and it was almost an attempt by Ms Clifford Ms Daniels to extort President Trump prosecutor objection. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1788.0s)]
*  Judge sustained Blanch then tries to keep going. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1804.0s)]
*  But then a moment later Mr Blanch again entering into an agreement with another individual you'll hear this agreement was negotiated by lawyers prosecutor objection. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1808.0s)]
*  Now at this point Judge Marchand does not even rule on the objection. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1818.0s)]
*  He doesn't say sustained doesn't say overruled. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1822.0s)]
*  He instead calls lawyers from both sides up to the bench. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1824.0s)]
*  Please approach the lawyers and the judge then confer and then the judge rules judge. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1828.0s)]
*  The objection is sustained. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1834.0s)]
*  Then Mr Blanch Trump's lawyer moves on to another topic but he makes it just three further pages into the transcript when the whole thing starts all over again. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1836.0s)]
*  This time it's over a mention of Michael Cohen Todd Blanch Trump's defense counsel quote separately from his obsession with President Trump and his obsession to get President Trump on multiple occasions. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1844.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen has testified under oath and lied prosecutor objection judge sustained Blanch. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1854.0s)]
*  He walked his he's walked into a courtroom very near here raised his right hand and swore to tell the truth. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1860.0s)]
*  And now he will tell you I expect that he was lying prosecutor objection judge sustained. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1866.0s)]
*  And then for a second time the judge calls up the lawyers for both sides to the bench to the bench counsel. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1872.0s)]
*  Please approach and a second time he upholds the objection Judge Marchand. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1878.0s)]
*  The objection is sustained. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1883.0s)]
*  Now I was in the court when the string of objections happened in the middle of Trump's team's opening statements both sides getting repeatedly hauled up before the judge the reporter excuse me the lawyer having to restart what he was saying try to find his momentum again pick back up to me as a lay person. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1886.0s)]
*  It seemed dramatic and strange but I want to ask our lawyers here. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1903.0s)]
*  How rare is it for objections to be made during opening statements. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1908.0s)]
*  How rare is it for the judge to interrupt opening statements with multiple directions to the lawyers including the one making the opening statement that they got to come up to the bench and talk to the judge. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1911.0s)]
*  Why were these objections made what does this tell us about the trial and about the defense that Trump's lawyer is trying to make luckily joining us now is Lisa Rubin who was at the courthouse today in the overflow room. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1922.0s)]
*  Lisa I understand that part of your sacrifice today was allowing me to be in the courtroom in a seat that you might otherwise have had your butt in. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1931.0s)]
*  So I'm not a sacrifice. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1937.0s)]
*  I'm very grateful and I hereby bequeath back to you. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1939.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1943.0s)]
*  I think well you actually in some ways in the overflow room might have had a slightly better view of this than I did sitting at the back of the courtroom watching it sort of down the aisle. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1944.0s)]
*  What was happening there and how weird was it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1953.0s)]
*  So it was weird not just because there was one objection but because of how many there were relative to the brevity of Todd Blanch's opening statement. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1955.0s)]
*  Let's start with the fact that Todd Blanch was an experienced prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1964.0s)]
*  But what he's not is an experienced defense lawyer. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1968.0s)]
*  We learned today from New York magazine something that confirms something that I suspected which is that Todd Blanch has tried exactly one trial as defense counsel in the last decade and on a fairly narrow issue. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1971.0s)]
*  And if you were just in that courtroom you probably would have expected as much because his flow was interrupted so many times by these frequent objections and the sidebars. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1982.0s)]
*  Now that having been said Rachel I think a number of the things that he did today were perfectly intentional because while they were objected to and the objections were sustained he still planted the seeds of doubt in the jurors minds. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=1991.0s)]
*  And in particular for example when he said that Stormy Daniels made Donald Trump a victim of extortion that was immediately objected to and sustained because that among other things is a legal conclusion. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2004.0s)]
*  There was no prosecution for example of Stormy Daniels for extorting Donald Trump. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2014.0s)]
*  And he would have known in advance that the judge was not going to allow him to get away with saying that. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2019.0s)]
*  I think that's probably right but there are other objections where he definitely knew and I think the place where he definitely knew was when he talked about what I'll call the diet advice of counsel defense. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2023.0s)]
*  Where he essentially said Trump believed that these nondisclosure agreements were totally kosher because he had attorneys negotiating them for him. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2033.0s)]
*  That's an issue that's already been litigated as part of the party's motions in limine which are the advanced arguments about which evidence can and can't come in. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2042.0s)]
*  Todd Blanch knew when he walked in the courtroom this morning that that was not going to be an argument allowed because he was trying to use the attorney client privilege as a sword and a shield essentially saying my client relied on lawyers advice. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2050.0s)]
*  But we're not going to tell you what that advice was and just like Judge Kaplan did in the Sam Bankman Freed case in fact Judge Murchon cited that ruling in making his own. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2061.0s)]
*  I'm not going to let your client do that. There is no advice of counsel light and yet that's where Blanch still went. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2070.0s)]
*  I'm going to give an instruction now that nobody knows is coming and I know it's going to make everybody move around but I'd like to talk to Catherine Christian if I could. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2076.0s)]
*  She's on the other side of the room and lots of cameras have to move. I realize in order to make this possible. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2084.0s)]
*  Hi Catherine. Thank you. You have experience in the New York New York District Attorney's Office. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2089.0s)]
*  The what Lisa is describing here about about Mr Blanch's relative and experience doing this kind of lawyering and this kind of a case is one piece of perspective here. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2094.0s)]
*  Another piece of perspective here is what's normal in a New York D.A. criminal proceeding like this. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2107.0s)]
*  When these interruptions these objections happened during the opening statements here from the defense. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2113.0s)]
*  How did that strike you. It's not unusual. Andrew and I will probably have a different experience. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2119.0s)]
*  New York State Court is not as dainty as federal court. So it's not shocking and defense attorneys some of them pride themselves on stepping on the line. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2124.0s)]
*  So you know I had object when I was a prosecutor because they stepped on the line and as Lisa said oopsie the jury heard what he said. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2134.0s)]
*  So it's in their head. So this I can't say it happens all the time but it's not shocking. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2144.0s)]
*  I rarely objected as a prosecutor because I didn't want the jury to think that I was trying to hide something from them or I was afraid. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2150.0s)]
*  Here I would have objected because he was clearly saying things he shouldn't have in the judge already ruled against. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2157.0s)]
*  But it's not shocking at least not in the world of one hundred cent astride in New York County. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2162.0s)]
*  And Catherine let me ask you about something Katie Frank said earlier where she said that you know in the minds of the jury Mr Blanch might have not done himself favors with all of those those statements being objected to today and all those interruptions because the jury might have thought even if those seeds were planted in their minds by things he wasn't supposed to say that he nevertheless had them in his head. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2167.0s)]
*  So if they had objected from here they at least would think that he was doing something wrong by being essentially sort of mini sanctioned by the judge in that way and interrupted in his flow. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2187.0s)]
*  No and the judge has struck the jury about objections and not to take them against the defense attorney or the prosecutor. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2196.0s)]
*  I have heard acquitting juries talk about how they liked how that defense attorney really fought for their client. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2203.0s)]
*  So I don't think you could read into oh it's sustained the jury is going to think very bad. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2211.0s)]
*  I think as Lisa just said there was a tactic he knew that these were objectionable things he was saying and they were objected to. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2216.0s)]
*  But it already you can't unring the bell is what you usually say. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2225.0s)]
*  It came out the jury and prosecutors cannot appeal an acquittal. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2229.0s)]
*  So under an order imposed by the court in this criminal case Donald Trump is not allowed to make or direct others to make public statements about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses concerning their potential participation in the investigation or in this criminal proceeding. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2236.0s)]
*  He's not allowed to do that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2254.0s)]
*  The prosecution is now arguing that Trump has done that a lot. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2256.0s)]
*  There'll be a hearing tomorrow morning at nine thirty Eastern before the jurors come into the courtroom. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2261.0s)]
*  Prosecutors are going to ask the judge to find that former President Trump willfully violated the gag order by attacking well known potential witnesses including Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen attacking their credibility on up to 10 separate occasions. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2266.0s)]
*  If the judge finds Trump in criminal contempt of court on these matters Trump could be fined up to a thousand dollars each for each violation. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2279.0s)]
*  That's what the prosecutors are asking for. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2288.0s)]
*  He could possibly be sentenced to a maximum of 30 days in jail although prosecutors are certainly not asking for that yet. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2290.0s)]
*  I mean tonight Trump sent around fundraising email called My Farewell Message making it sound like he's definitely going to jail. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2297.0s)]
*  I already meant to ask our legal experts about it but we just queued up some new sound from Donald Trump today. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2306.0s)]
*  This is from an interview on a conservative network called Real America's Voice. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2312.0s)]
*  Here it is Donald Trump talking about the jury in his trial. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2318.0s)]
*  That jury was picked so fast. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2322.0s)]
*  Ninety five percent Democrats. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2326.0s)]
*  The area is mostly all Democrat. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2329.0s)]
*  You think of it as a just a purely Democrat area. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2331.0s)]
*  It's a very unfair situation that I can tell you. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2334.0s)]
*  That jury 95 percent Democrats. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2338.0s)]
*  Again the last item in the gag order forbids Trump from making or directing others to make public statements about any prospective juror or any juror in this criminal proceeding. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2341.0s)]
*  Andrew Weissman still with us here tonight. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2352.0s)]
*  The gag order has been the discussion that I feel like we've had around the edges of this case a lot because it's the way that Trump has tried to kind of shape the environment around this case. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2357.0s)]
*  It's going to be in the courtroom front and center tomorrow morning at 930. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2367.0s)]
*  What do you expect Judge Murchon is going to do? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2371.0s)]
*  What are you going to be watching for? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2374.0s)]
*  So you have Donald Trump clearly goading the judge. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2376.0s)]
*  The fact that he's doing something that appears by all accounts to be a direct violation of the order as late as tonight in advance of a 930 hearing on violations with respect to witnesses and a violation with respect to jurors. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2381.0s)]
*  Both of which are things that a judge is going to care tremendously about. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2399.0s)]
*  I think the you know, obviously he's going to hear from the defense and you know, the betting is that he's going to certainly say that there was a violation and he could impose the fine that is obviously negligible and he can saber-rattle about what's next. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2404.0s)]
*  This is one where what I would say if I were like if he were sitting right here, I would say leave aside politics. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2421.0s)]
*  Leave aside what he's goading somebody to do. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2431.0s)]
*  What would you do for any other defendant? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2435.0s)]
*  You know, we have seen the legal system bend over sort of so far to accommodate Donald Trump. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2438.0s)]
*  He is he is not being treated worse. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2446.0s)]
*  He is being treated so much better whether you're talking about DOJ, whether you're talking about all of the criminal cases. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2449.0s)]
*  And this is one where he wouldn't have to impose 30 days in jail, but he can really do like a child, give him a time out. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2456.0s)]
*  He can be stepped back and be kept in the pens in the courthouse. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2464.0s)]
*  But I think this is so clearly like a child testing what will happen. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2468.0s)]
*  And it's at the very outset of the case. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2472.0s)]
*  If there isn't a firm hand right now and the rule of law isn't imposed, it really is a terrible message in terms of how the trial is going to go forward because he's going to continue doing this. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2475.0s)]
*  And if there are jurors he doesn't like, he can attack them. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2487.0s)]
*  If he's going to try and seek a mistrial by his antics, that's something he could try. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2490.0s)]
*  So the court, who is extremely experienced, I think is going to have to be really careful about what exact as the sanction he's going to impose tomorrow. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2495.0s)]
*  How will the judge decide or how will the hearing on this go? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2504.0s)]
*  Again, this is going to be the way that court starts tomorrow. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2508.0s)]
*  Is he going to ask defense? Is he just going to rule or is he going to ask defense counsel and the prosecutors to make arguments in front of him? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2512.0s)]
*  Is he going to have a witness talk? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2519.0s)]
*  So he could ask both sides to state their position. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2521.0s)]
*  He could see if there is a dispute of facts. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2525.0s)]
*  You could actually have a hearing on this, but there may not be a dispute of facts. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2529.0s)]
*  I mean, the facts seem so clear unless Donald Trump's going to say somebody else took over my account. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2534.0s)]
*  You know, Roger Stone tried that when he was in violation. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2540.0s)]
*  He actually took the witness stand and said, I didn't do that. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2543.0s)]
*  And then he later sort of recanted and said, OK, I did do it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2547.0s)]
*  And, you know, that was when he posted the judge's picture with crosshairs next to her head. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2550.0s)]
*  And so there can be a hearing, but it may not be necessary. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2556.0s)]
*  Just given the volume of allegations here, there's now, I think, up to 11 allegations that are going to be before the judge. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2561.0s)]
*  But ultimately, it would be the state's burden to go forward. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDPNSYmWvk&t=2571.0s)]
