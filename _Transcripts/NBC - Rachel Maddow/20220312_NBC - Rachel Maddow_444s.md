# China Joins Russia In Alarming New Bioweapon Propaganda Campaign
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg)
*  The People's Daily is the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=0.0s)]
*  Today it ran this article, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=6.4s)]
*  U.S. tries to refute rumors about its bio labs in Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=8.0s)]
*  But can we believe it? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=12.64s)]
*  The People's Daily actually ran a whole bunch of articles today on the supposed risk of U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=14.4s)]
*  bio labs in Ukraine and did basically all of the state-controlled Russian language press [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=19.28s)]
*  touting the unfounded conspiracy theory. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=24.88s)]
*  Today the Russian ambassador to the UN convened a special meeting of the UN Security Council [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=27.36s)]
*  where he baselessly alleged that the U.S. was funding biological weapons labs in Ukraine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  The claims were rejected outright by the United States and the UK, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=39.68s)]
*  which called them utter nonsense. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=42.8s)]
*  The UN also said that there's no credible evidence that the U.S. has been operating [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=44.88s)]
*  biological weapons plants in Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=49.44s)]
*  But this completely ginned up story has become major news in both Russian and Chinese media. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=52.0s)]
*  The New York Times reports that analysts who study disinformation from the two nations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  said this was the first time they had seen this scale of amplification between Beijing and Moscow [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=62.8s)]
*  around a conspiracy theory. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=68.8s)]
*  And while that coordination is alarming, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=70.8s)]
*  and countering big lies like this is one challenge, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=73.92s)]
*  the more immediate concern is that U.S. officials are warning that this new fake narrative [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=76.32s)]
*  about these bio labs could be Russia setting the pretense for an attack of its own. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=81.36s)]
*  We know that Russia's not afraid to use internationally banned chemical weapons [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  for assassinations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  Russia used chemical weapons when poisoning former Russian intelligence officer [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=92.24s)]
*  Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=96.64s)]
*  and again when it targeted former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in 2018. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=99.36s)]
*  A chemical nerve agent was also used in the attempted poisoning [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=105.44s)]
*  of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=108.72s)]
*  In 2020, Russia also supported Syria's government in its efforts to cover up its use of chemical [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=111.36s)]
*  weapons against its own people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=118.32s)]
*  I don't even know where to begin with a problem like this, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=120.88s)]
*  but luckily we have someone who does. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=122.96s)]
*  Andy Weber was Obama's assistant secretary of defense for nuclear chemical and biological defense. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=125.44s)]
*  He was the person tasked with finding, removing, and destroying serious chemical weapons. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=130.96s)]
*  He's also visited the research labs in Ukraine that are the subject [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=136.72s)]
*  of this new bio weapons conspiracy narrative. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=140.16000000000003s)]
*  Joining us now is Andy Weber. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  He is a former assistant secretary of defense for nuclear chemical and biological defense programs [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  in the Obama administration. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=149.28s)]
*  Andy, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  You have been to those labs in the Ukraine that this fuss is all about. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=152.72000000000003s)]
*  What are they? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=157.28s)]
*  Well, they're public health labs mostly also animal health labs. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=160.0s)]
*  They're similar to our centers for disease control. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  We've been working with them now since 2015 or since 2005 actually to strengthen their capacity [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  to monitor, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks to protect public health [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=177.68s)]
*  in Ukraine and to be part of an early warning system of infectious disease outbreaks [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=184.56s)]
*  so they can be isolated before they spread around the world. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=190.4s)]
*  Andy, U.S. officials think that all of this talk about biological weapons and these accusations [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=194.16s)]
*  and this conspiracy theory may be a prelude to Russia itself using chemical or biological weapons [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=198.48s)]
*  in an attack. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=204.48s)]
*  Do we know, what do you know about that and what do you know of their capabilities to be on that front? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=205.28s)]
*  Well, I do worry a lot. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=212.4s)]
*  You gave some examples of Russia using banned chemical weapons in peacetime [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=213.84s)]
*  in those two assassination attempts that were made in the early 2000s. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=218.48s)]
*  In the United Kingdom and inside Russia. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=224.0s)]
*  So it is a very real threat. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  I think it's more likely that they would use chemical or biological weapons [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=228.0s)]
*  than they would nuclear weapons, even though Putin has threatened the possible use of nuclear weapons. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=232.72s)]
*  So I think it is a very serious concern and the playbook is very similar to what has happened [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=238.56s)]
*  in Syria in recent years where the regime, the Assad regime uses chemical weapons against [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=245.6s)]
*  men, women and children and then blames it on the opposition. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=252.88s)]
*  So it is possible that this escalation of rhetoric, which used to be sort of plants in the press [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=256.48s)]
*  and Bulgaria and classic KGB disinformation campaign, but it's now escalated to senior official levels. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=264.96s)]
*  Even the the Putin she statement during the Olympics made this crazy accusation that the United States [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=273.12s)]
*  is somehow supporting biological weapons. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=282.96s)]
*  It's known to everybody that President Nixon ended the United States biological weapons program in 1969. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=286.0s)]
*  And it's Russia that has been violating the convention ever since. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=293.12s)]
*  So what do you make of this? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  You just made a reference to a statement with Chinese Premier Xi. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=300.88s)]
*  What do you make of the Chinese state media echoing Russia's lie about these bio labs? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=304.56s)]
*  What's China's role or what's their goal here? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=309.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very interesting new development that started when the COVID pandemic first hit [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  and China, borrowing from the Russian disinformation playbook, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=320.96s)]
*  accused the United States military of causing the COVID pandemic. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=327.84s)]
*  So the fact that that China is echoing the Russian disinformation is very disturbing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=334.96s)]
*  It's as if President Xi is acting as President Putin's poodle in this case. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=344.0s)]
*  What do we do when we gather information about things like this? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=352.32s)]
*  Is Russia were to stage a chemical weapon attack or commit one themselves? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  What should the Russian? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, what should the US response? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=362.56s)]
*  What should the Western response be? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=363.92s)]
*  Well, I think we should continue to do what we've been doing from the beginning, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=367.04s)]
*  which is as we get intelligence about planning for such attacks and our intelligence on [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=371.76s)]
*  Russian military operations has been nothing short of exquisite. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  We release that publicly as we're doing now in the hopes that it will deter [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Putin and the Russian military from doing something horrible, like using chemical [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=388.32s)]
*  or biological weapons against civilians in Ukraine as part of their terrible scorched [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=394.32s)]
*  earth policy. But we need to call them out on it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=400.32s)]
*  And we also need to present the facts. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=403.36s)]
*  And the facts are that Russia has three military biological weapons facilities that no international [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=406.24s)]
*  inspectors have ever been to. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=412.56s)]
*  So it's clearly Russia that is violating the biological and toxin weapons convention, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  not the United States. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=421.92s)]
*  you [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAg6aecdgMg&t=442.48s)]
