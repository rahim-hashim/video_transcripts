# Biden Foreshadows Russian Brutality In Ukraine While Celebrating Unity And Hope
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA)
*  Let's bring in now Ambassador Michael McFaul, who of course served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=0.0s)]
*  during the Obama administration. Ambassador McFaul, thank you for being with us. I want to get your [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=3.92s)]
*  reaction to what we heard tonight from the President. Was there anything that you heard there [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=8.64s)]
*  that surprised you? Is there anything in that speech that you think may make a material [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=13.76s)]
*  difference in terms of what happens next? Well, my biggest surprise was to see Democrats and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=17.52s)]
*  Republicans standing up together and applauding. Rachel, we haven't seen that for a long time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  That's an interesting thing that Putin has done to unite us on that. We weren't united just two [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=30.4s)]
*  weeks ago, even with respect to how to deal with Putin. That was very interesting to me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=35.04s)]
*  Both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, by the way, were divided. We're not. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=40.8s)]
*  That's a good sign. Second, I think he said the right things in the general framing of the issue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=44.88s)]
*  There's a fight between autocracy and democracy. Those kinds of framing, I think, is right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=50.56s)]
*  I would have liked a little more detail on that, I think, explaining to the American people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=57.2s)]
*  why this matters to us, why the fight in Ukraine matters not just for democracy and freedom in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  Ukraine, but Europe and ultimately for us. He said it—you know, he said a sentence. He said, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=67.92s)]
*  we've got to stop dictators now before they go further. But I think just a couple more paragraphs [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  would have been appropriate. I also like what he said about the oligarchs. That got an applause [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  line, seized the yachts of the oligarchs. But I think we need to get into some detail here, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=82.48s)]
*  Rachel, and I'm not sure you're going to let me do it right now, but maybe another time, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  because you know a lot about this, and we should interview you about this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=92.0s)]
*  I'm remembering a book called Blowout. And that is to say not all oligarchs are alike. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  We just keep throwing this term around as if they're all a bunch of rich people and they all [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=101.12s)]
*  live in London and they're all close to Putin. It's not true. Some oligarchs live in London and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  have yachts there, and Putin hates them. And some oligarchs don't live in London. They run the oil [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=110.48s)]
*  and gas companies, and we're not seizing their assets. And they want those other assets of those [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  oligarchs to be seized. So it's the right thing to do. I support sanctions. They're putting a lot [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=121.68s)]
*  of pressure on the Russian society. I just think we've got to be careful about how we talk about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=126.72s)]
*  how these kinds of things will actually impact Putin and his decision-making. It's not so [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=132.8s)]
*  clear-cut the way it works. Yeah, it needs to be done careful if it's going to have the impact that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=137.92s)]
*  it's intended to have. Surgically. Ambassador McFaul, I want to press you on what you heard [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  in what was really the most soaring part of the speech, lifting up President Zelensky, who is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  right now the world's most visible freedom fighter and his people. But the president has so [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  consistently declassified intelligence about what is to come, and hauntingly he's been correct. And [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=162.8s)]
*  so I want to ask you what we should read into this part of the speech. The president said this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  We remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage, but the next few days, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  weeks and months will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos, but while he may [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  make gains on the battlefield, he will continue to pay high price over the long run. Is the president [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=184.08s)]
*  what is he saying? What should we hear? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=190.88s)]
*  I heard a couple of things there. It's a great thing to focus on. One is remember Putin initially [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  started with the kind of shock and awe. He thought the Ukrainians would run. He thought Zelensky would [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  be in Poland by now, and then he could just roll in and everybody would be happy and greet him [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=206.64s)]
*  happily. That didn't work. And you saw the anger in Putin's voice just a couple of days ago when he [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=211.76s)]
*  put his nuclear forces on alert. If you're winning the war, you don't make threats like that, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=217.84s)]
*  So now we're moving to a different phase. And for me, it's a very familiar phase. It's what he did [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=223.36s)]
*  in Chechnya. It's what he did in Grozny, in Chechnya, the capital there. It's what he did in Aleppo, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  in Syria, after they invaded there with his air force in 2015, which is going to be—and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=233.04s)]
*  you've already seen it in Kharkiv, and it feels like it's coming in Kiev—where they're going to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  use massive military power with lots of civilians dying, and Putin doesn't care, because he thinks [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=243.2s)]
*  that by terrorizing the civilians, he will be able to take control. And I think the president [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=250.16s)]
*  was warning us about that. What happens next? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=255.6s)]
*  Well, the Ukrainians are going to fight. I mean, I was just exchanging messages with a close friend [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=261.84s)]
*  of mine in Kiev who knows the president well, President Zelensky, and we are talking about those [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=268.88s)]
*  options. And one of the things we discussed was, would it be worse or better if President Zelensky [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=274.56s)]
*  was alive in Lviv or arrested or killed in Kiev? And we were strategizing. And then my friend at [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=280.56s)]
*  the end of this said, but you know, Mike, he's not leaving. So we can talk about all we want, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=287.28s)]
*  but he's going to stay there and fight. And if they fight and they maintain some resistance, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=292.8s)]
*  maybe there's a chance for a negotiated settlement. Maybe Xi Jinping comes in and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=297.76s)]
*  helps. But that's not what I predict. My prediction is going to get very nasty, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=302.24s)]
*  and it's going to be very tragic. And then we're going to feel even more what I feel today is, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=307.2s)]
*  it's great to be unified. It's great that NATO's together. It's great that we're supplying the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=313.12s)]
*  Ukrainians—we should be supplying more, by the way, more weapons, more stingers, more javelins. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  Now that's what I hear from Ukrainians on the ground. But when this assault comes, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=323.12s)]
*  we're all going to be unified, watching as the Ukrainians fight. And that's going to be a very [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=327.68s)]
*  tragic moment. It's going to be a very uncomfortable moment for us. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=332.72s)]
*  Just the human calamity. I feel like you did a better job perhaps preparing us for that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=336.32s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ambassador Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=341.92s)]
*  you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ati1TOqgAAA&t=365.36s)]
