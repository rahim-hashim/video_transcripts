# Supreme Court Effectively Ends Trump Foot-Dragging On 1/6 Investigation Document Requests
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM)
*  Bottom line, is this going to be the last word from the United States Supreme Court on this issue, or is there something else we're waiting to hear from on them? Something else that could conceivably go in Trump's direction? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=0.0s)]
*  That, I feel like, is the first question we basically need advice on. Is this it? I'll tell you, the January 6 investigators just put out a statement tonight that says, quote, the select committee has already begun to receive records that the former president had hoped to keep hidden. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=11.0s)]
*  They say in response, in a very short amount of time, a very short amount of time having elapsed after this ruling tonight, they say they are already getting documents. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=26.0s)]
*  Does this mean they're going to get them all? Does this mean they're only going to get some selection of them and there's rulings yet to be made on the rest of them? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=36.0s)]
*  If they are going to get them all, when? How fast does this happen? Especially since it looks like it's starting to happen tonight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=44.0s)]
*  Joining us now to help sort me out on some of these issues is Linda Greenhouse. She is a long-time Supreme Court reporter and analyst for the New York Times. She's a lecturer at Yale Law School as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=53.0s)]
*  Her latest book is Justice on the Brick, the Death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Rise of Amy Coney Barrett, and 12 Months that Transformed the Supreme Court. Linda Greenhouse, I'm always grateful when you can make time to be here. I'm particularly grateful for you being here on short notice tonight. Thank you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=62.0s)]
*  Oh, my pleasure, Rachel. So, let me just ask you. Please. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=77.0s)]
*  So, the documents have been in the custody of the archivist, the archivist of the United States, who had taken the position that, yes, this stuff is releasable, but I'm not going to release it until I make sure that a court's not going to stop me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=82.0s)]
*  So that's why they're all coming out tonight. So this is it, functionally, for that bunch of documents. I think it's 700 some odd pages. There are other bunches of documents that, as I understand, the archivist hasn't yet fully gone through. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=97.0s)]
*  But certainly, you know, the opinion that came down tonight, the unsigned opinion, is just one paragraph, just one paragraph long. It could be one of the most important one paragraphs that we've seen in a very long time from any court. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=116.0s)]
*  Linda, one of the other things that we have watched unfold over the past few months, a lot of people have received subpoenas from the January 6th investigation. Most people have complied, but a bunch of them have sued the January 6th committee, some of them echoing these privilege, privilege claims that Trump was pursuing in the courts that, as you know, it appeared to have been sort of cut off at the knees by the Supreme Court unsigned ruling tonight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=131.0s)]
*  Do you expect that this ruling will have sort of cascading implications for the other people who have sued the committee to try to avoid testifying or handing over documents? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=157.0s)]
*  I would certainly think so. I mean, if I were any of those people, I would not be sleeping very easily tonight. Now, I suppose some of them could make a claim that, well, there was a compelling public need for the kind of documents, Rachel, that you showed on the screen earlier. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=168.0s)]
*  But, you know, I'm just a little fish and there's nothing compelling about my role in this. And so the subpoenas over and broad, subpoenas not justified, that kind of thing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=184.0s)]
*  But certainly we've seen the courts, as you said, the district court all the way up now, a justice is taking a very dim view of any kind of claim of privilege here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=194.0s)]
*  So I think this really will kind of turn on the faucet of being able to find out more about what happened on January 6th. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=208.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWlsYssCqM&t=224.0s)]
