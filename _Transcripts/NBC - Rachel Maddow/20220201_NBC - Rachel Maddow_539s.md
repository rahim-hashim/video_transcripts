# Trump Sought Means Of Seizing Voting Machines In Wake Of His 2020 Election Defeat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE)
*  The more we learn about Trump's efforts to overthrow the government and prevent the next [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=0.0s)]
*  duly elected president from being sworn in, the more it sounds like a little bit like speed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=5.68s)]
*  dating, right? I mean, he tries roping the Defense Department into this scheme. Hey, send out the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=11.52s)]
*  military and go seize all the voting equipment. Military apparently passed. Then he tried the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=16.0s)]
*  Homeland Security Department, also passed, also a no-go. Well, how about the Justice Department? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=21.04s)]
*  Bill Barr, have the Justice Department go out and seize the voting equipment. Apparently, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  Bill Barr wasn't into it either. But in this new reporting from the Times, we learn about one more [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=32.08s)]
*  potential suitor, one more potential date that Donald Trump tried to get on board for his effort [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=38.24s)]
*  at an insurrection. This is fascinating to me. This is what the Times reports. Quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  around the same time that Mr. Trump brought up the possibility of having the Justice Department [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=50.0s)]
*  seize the voting machines, he also tried to persuade state lawmakers in contested states [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=54.56s)]
*  like Michigan and Pennsylvania that they should use local law enforcement agencies to take control [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=59.6s)]
*  of the machines. The state lawmakers refused to go along with the plan. I mean, we should hear [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=65.68s)]
*  about it from those local Republicans in Michigan and Pennsylvania, but we should also probably hear [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=73.04s)]
*  about it from the January 6th investigations, potentially from anybody bringing criminal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  charges around this plot. Did anybody actually try it? How was this demand from the president received? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=83.2s)]
*  We've learned a lot about how Trump tried to use the power of the federal government to seize voting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=92.4s)]
*  machines, to try and change the results of the election in his favor. Was there a state-level [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=96.72s)]
*  component of his plan, too? Joining us now is Michael Schmidt. He's the Washington correspondent [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=101.68s)]
*  for the New York Times. He was one of the reporters who broke the story about Trump's involvement [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=105.76s)]
*  in the plans to seize the voting machines. Mr. Schmidt, it's nice to have you here tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=109.36s)]
*  Congratulations on this scoop. Thanks for having me. It's been a lot of revelations in the last 48 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=113.36s)]
*  hours. Let me just ask you if I put any of that wrong or if I've got the emphasis the wrong way [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=120.96s)]
*  around, if there's anything that I'm missing out in terms of what you and your colleagues have reported. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=125.68s)]
*  No, no, that was a great summation of it. I think that for us, the most important thing here [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=130.64s)]
*  is that there's a lot of different things that have emerged in the past year that we've learned [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=138.56s)]
*  that Donald Trump's advisors and Republicans across the country did. We also know a lot of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=144.88s)]
*  what Donald Trump said out loud and did publicly. What our reporting, we thought, advanced and what [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=151.76s)]
*  made it important is that it brought Trump himself into the effort in a way that we had not seen [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=160.4s)]
*  before. This was more than just using, calling people and pressuring them and filing fruitless [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=167.92s)]
*  lawsuits. This was contemplating using three of the most powerful institutions, not just in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=176.64s)]
*  country, but in the world, the Department of Defense, the Justice Department, and the Department [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=185.04s)]
*  of Homeland Security. To use that apparatus as the president of the United States, the person who [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  controls them and consider using them in this effort to remain in power sets itself out as one [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=199.36s)]
*  of the more extraordinary efforts that was underway to undermine this election. I'm not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=209.52s)]
*  diminishing the other things that he tried, but we thought that this attempt was in a special lane [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=218.24s)]
*  of itself, and he was there and was more than just curious about the idea. Do we know, Mike, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  why they thought it would be necessary or helpful or would advance the plot [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=241.52s)]
*  to physically seize voting equipment? Whether they were going to have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=246.32s)]
*  defense or Homeland Security or the Justice Department pull off this scheme, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=250.72s)]
*  why did they want the physical equipment? It's a great question. Even as we were finishing our [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=255.28s)]
*  reporting on this, I was thinking to myself, why did they want these machines? Because it's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=261.92s)]
*  so different than any other type of election interference we've seen in this country. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=269.36s)]
*  To our best understanding from our reporting, they wanted the machines because they thought that the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=278.24s)]
*  machines, or they had been hacked. The conspiracy was that the Dominion machines had been hacked [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  and that they needed to get their hands on the machines so they could show that there had been [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  hacking and that votes had been turned away from Trump that should have been for him. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=296.64s)]
*  They needed the machines in order to do that. At the same time, though, and I don't know how this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=302.64s)]
*  relates to it, Flynn wanted to rerun the election. Flynn wanted for the government to have another [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  election. I have no indication that the seizing of it was related to that. But Flynn, in these [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=321.52s)]
*  television appearances in which he said out loud the same stuff that's being reported here, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=329.68s)]
*  talked about the idea of rerunning the election. Presumably, what happens here, if it works, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  if they can get a federal agency to head out in force and start seizing voting equipment all over [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=346.4s)]
*  the country, that at the very least creates such a controversy, creates such a stir, creates such [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=353.44s)]
*  an appearance of seriousness about what's gone wrong in the election that that would undergird [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=362.08s)]
*  with steel any effort by state legislators to unfinalize election results, to decertify election [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=368.0s)]
*  results, to say there's some reason that they can't clearly say that Biden won or that the results [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=375.68s)]
*  have a definitive, were definitive and conclusive. In the same way that we saw the Justice Department [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=381.2s)]
*  draft letter to Georgia where they were going to hype claims of fraud to Georgia state legislators [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=388.0s)]
*  as a basis for telling those legislators that they should reconsider the finalization of the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=394.48s)]
*  electors there, presumably this would have been such a scandal, it would have been such a [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  constitutional crisis in the country that it would have opened the door to those, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=403.28s)]
*  to friendly legislators in those states actually saying that the election wasn't over. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  Correct. The problem was that he couldn't find someone to do it. And it's a constant theme [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=414.64s)]
*  that runs through his presidency, whether it's trying to fire Mueller or, you know, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=421.44s)]
*  a range of different things. This is a pattern. He wants to do something, he doesn't want to do [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  it himself, he asks someone else to do it, he does it in a way that sort of brings it up and says, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  when he's in the Oval Office with Barr, he says, my lawyers say that the Justice Department can [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=439.76s)]
*  seize these things. Is this something that the Justice Department could do without sort of going [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  that extra step to really sort of directly ask Barr about it? And the thing that I was thinking [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=452.72s)]
*  about as you're asking that question is that in this instance, in this really, really important [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=460.32000000000005s)]
*  period of time, where you could argue that it came down to Bill Barr and Ken Cuccinelli basically [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=465.6s)]
*  giving Trump the Heisman and saying, no, we're not going to do this. If that were to happen today, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=472.0s)]
*  based on what has happened with the Republican Party and the way that Trump has continued to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=479.76s)]
*  tug it in his direction, and sort of the way that they have continued to entertain, not just [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=484.88s)]
*  entertain, but go along with what he said, I don't think it would have been, you know, if that were [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=491.52s)]
*  to happen today, and he were president, I don't think he would have such a difficult time finding [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=495.84s)]
*  someone to do it. I don't think, you know, there are governors that have shown immense loyalty to [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=500.8s)]
*  him across the country that are more and more loyal to him today than they were before. And, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=506.48s)]
*  you know, I think if this had happened at a later date, he may have been more successful. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbcazOkdLcE&t=513.2s)]
