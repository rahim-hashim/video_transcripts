# Maddow explains MSNBC deferring coverage of Trump speech
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU)
*  I need to say that former President Trump has just started making public remarks, just [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=0.0s)]
*  as he did on the evening of his first arraignment on criminal charges. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=4.96s)]
*  That was April, when he was booked on 34 felony counts brought by the state of New York. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=8.2s)]
*  Now, tonight, after his arraignment on federal felony charges, he's speaking again, this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=12.72s)]
*  time to an audience of his supporters that's gathered for a campaign fundraiser tonight [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=16.64s)]
*  at his golf club and summer home in New Jersey. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=21.52s)]
*  We knew heading into this that he was planning to make these remarks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=26.16s)]
*  We are prepared for his pre fundraiser remarks tonight to again be essentially a Trump campaign [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=29.2s)]
*  speech. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=34.8s)]
*  Because of that, we do not intend to carry these remarks live. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=36.24s)]
*  As we have said before, in these circumstances, there is a cost to us as a news organization [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=40.04s)]
*  to knowingly broadcast untrue things. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=45.36s)]
*  We are here to bring you the news. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=48.58s)]
*  It hurts our ability to do that if we live broadcast what we fully expect in advance [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=50.2s)]
*  to be a litany of lies and false accusations, no matter who says them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=55.72s)]
*  And I do not say this with any glee. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=62.0s)]
*  I hope it is clear that this is not a glib decision. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=64.0s)]
*  We take our responsibilities seriously. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=67.12s)]
*  We revisit decisions like this all the time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=69.08s)]
*  We make the best call that we can in real time every time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=71.34s)]
*  But tonight, our call is this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=75.8s)]
*  We will monitor that speech by the newly indicted former president. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=77.24s)]
*  We will not carry his remarks live. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=80.98s)]
*  If he says anything newsworthy, we promise we will turn that right around and bring it back to you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEvRiVSKkU&t=83.18s)]
