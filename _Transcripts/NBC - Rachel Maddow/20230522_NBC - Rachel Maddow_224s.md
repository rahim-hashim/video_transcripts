# DOJ's reported interest in Trump foreign business deals reframes scope of Mar-a-Lago probe
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY)
*  This headline from the New York Times reads, quote, prosecutors sought records on Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=0.0s)]
*  foreign business deals since 2017. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=4.68s)]
*  According to two people familiar with the matter, quote, federal prosecutors overseeing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=8.76s)]
*  the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents have issued a subpoena [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=12.44s)]
*  for information about his business dealings in foreign countries after he took office [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=17.84s)]
*  as president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=23.88s)]
*  Quote, it remains unclear precisely what the prosecutors were hoping to find by sending [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  the subpoena to Mr. Trump's company. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=30.16s)]
*  But the subpoena suggests investigators have cast a wider net than previously understood [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=33.12s)]
*  as they scrutinize whether he broke the law and taking sensitive government materials [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=38.56s)]
*  with him upon leaving the White House and then not fully complying with demands for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=42.36s)]
*  their return. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=47.26s)]
*  When disparate breaking news stories like that break within moments of each other right [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=49.34s)]
*  before we get in the air, we call Barb McQuite, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=53.76s)]
*  of Michigan, co-host of the Sisters in Law podcast. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=58.6s)]
*  Barb, it's really great to see you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=61.8s)]
*  Thanks very much for joining us on sort of short notice tonight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=63.4s)]
*  You bet. Glad to be with you, Rachel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=66.36s)]
*  Let me just ask you if you can explain what you see as significant, if anything, about [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=68.66s)]
*  this news of the federal subpoena, prosecutors looking into Trump's possible foreign business [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=74.36s)]
*  dealings dating back to when he took office in 2017. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=80.44s)]
*  What does that say to you? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, it is both a fairly routine move, but also one with potentially explosive consequences, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I think, Rachel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=92.48s)]
*  You know, whenever you're investigating a white-collar case, you want to follow the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=93.48s)]
*  money, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  It's what Deep Throat told Woodward and Bernstein to do, because you might find some [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  interesting connections, trails, motives, et cetera. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=100.8s)]
*  But in this case, when prosecutors are deciding whether to file charges for mishandling classified [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  documents, they're looking for aggravating factors like obstruction of justice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=109.6s)]
*  But another one is disloyalty to the United States. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  So if you can make a link that there was some motive for payments from a foreign government [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=115.96s)]
*  in exchange for perhaps sharing classified documents about those things or trying to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=120.96s)]
*  leverage information to get an upper hand in business negotiations, that could be a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=125.84s)]
*  very powerful aggravating factor that could lead toward charges for mishandling these [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  classified documents. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=135.66s)]
*  Now, the target of this subpoena, according to The New York Times' reporting, was Trump's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=137.72s)]
*  business. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=142.12s)]
*  And Trump's business has had its own legal story in the past year or two, including being [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=143.12s)]
*  convicted as a business entity on counts related to business and tax fraud. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=150.12s)]
*  How much leeway does the Trump organization, Trump's organization as a business, have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=157.08s)]
*  in complying with a subpoena like this? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=163.12s)]
*  Is it a black and white case where they have no choice in the matter, or is this the sort [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  of thing where they could either resist it or fight it overtly in court? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  They could fight it, Rachel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=173.56s)]
*  I mean, ordinarily, when you get a subpoena from the government, the presumption is that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=174.56s)]
*  it is regular and that you will comply with it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=177.96s)]
*  And really, the only basis for objecting is if there is some sort of privilege—I can't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=180.76s)]
*  really imagine one here—or that it is somehow overly broad. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, if you asked for millions and millions of documents, a company might say that's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=188.2s)]
*  unreasonable and might go to court to quash it or try to narrow the scope of it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=192.68s)]
*  But ordinarily, if you ask a business for their business records and it's within the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=196.84s)]
*  scope of the investigation, then a judge is going to enforce that subpoena. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=413LNpi8QHY&t=200.08s)]
