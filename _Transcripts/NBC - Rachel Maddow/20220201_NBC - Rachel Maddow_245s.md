# Former Pence Lawyer Hailed As 'Patriot' For Lengthy Testimony To January 6 Committee
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk)
*  So this guy, Gregory Jacob, the vice president, Pence's top lawyer for the investigators trying to get to the bottom of Donald Trump's efforts to overthrow the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=0.0s)]
*  government and prevent the newly elected president from being sworn in. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=10.16s)]
*  For those investigators, Gregory Jacob is an interesting fact witness. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=15.4s)]
*  Right. I mean, he was in the room with Trump when this Trump when Trump and this lawyer were pushing Pence that they needed to go along with the scheme to overthrow the government. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=18.48s)]
*  He had a two hour meeting with this Trump lawyer and the following day, who was trying to convey instructions, specific instructions for Vice President Pence to follow, to throw out all the Biden electors, to overthrow the government, to overturn the election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=27.88s)]
*  Gregory Jacob, as Pence's chief counsel, he just has this interesting window into what Trump's allies were thinking and arguing for in real time while the attack was in its final planning stages and while it was underway. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=42.84s)]
*  Even while the physical attack on the Capitol was still underway, they were still pushing Vice President Pence to overturn the election. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=57.0s)]
*  Even once it was over, they were still pushing Vice President Pence to overturn the election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=64.04s)]
*  And apparently, Gregory Jacob has a paper trail to back all of this up, having taken contemporaneous notes on everything that the Trump side was telling him and what they were telling Vice President Pence to do. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=67.72s)]
*  Interesting witness, right? If they could get him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=81.6s)]
*  Well, today, here was Gregory Jacob on his way to provide testimony to the January 6th investigators in Congress. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=84.72s)]
*  He testified to investigators for almost nine hours today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Really, which is a very long time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason we know that, part of the reason that was confirmed tonight is because of comments from the chairman of the January 6th investigation, Congressman Benny Thompson of Mississippi. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=100.4s)]
*  I'm just going to play you this conversation between Benny Thompson and a reporter. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  This is my favorite piece of tape so far from the January 6th investigation, and you're about to see why. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=115.28s)]
*  This is Chairman Thompson tonight talking to a reporter and confirming that, yeah, Gregory Jacob did come in and testify, and it turned out to be a long day and a big deal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=120.8s)]
*  Listen to how he sort of spools it out. This is excellent. This is from tonight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=133.12s)]
*  How was your weekend? First of all, it was the end of deer season. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=137.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=144.72s)]
*  And I went deer hunting. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  Did you get anything? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  I absolutely did. You need some meat? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't really, I don't eat, I like meat, but I've never had deer meat. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=150.32s)]
*  You never had venison? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  I've never had deer meat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=154.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. You don't know what you've been missing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=155.92s)]
*  Is it good? Do you cook it like steak? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  That venison's great. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  You can do it any way. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=161.2s)]
*  Okay. How do you like it? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=162.07999999999998s)]

*  Well, you know, we're glad he came, and obviously it's part of the work that we do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=182.0s)]
*  He's a great patriot. He loves this country more so than other people who don't. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHx4ZcS7Qsk&t=188.48s)]
