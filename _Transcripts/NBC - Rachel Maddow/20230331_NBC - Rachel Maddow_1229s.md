# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 30
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo)
*  While tonight's news is not a surprise, while this is something that we have been expecting for a long while now, while this is something that we certainly have been thinking through the implications of for a very long while now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=0.0s)]
*  So while this does not come out of the blue, I do think there's one thing we all need to be preparing for here that we are maybe not prepared for. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=11.0s)]
*  And that is what I think is the very high probability that this is going to be boring. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=23.0s)]
*  I'm not sure we're prepared for that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm not sure either side ideologically is prepared for that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=34.0s)]
*  I don't think the punditocracy is prepared for that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=37.0s)]
*  I don't think you and I tonight are prepared for that because this feels like really big news and really big news feels like it has a lot of momentum. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=39.0s)]
*  But as far as I can tell, right, this is about a legal proceeding starting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=46.0s)]
*  And if you look at the kind of legal proceeding this is going to be, I think we need to prepare ourselves for the fact that a this might go on for a really long time and it might go on where the incremental additional news on this news story each day is something that feels like reading the small print on the back of a lottery ticket or even your car rental insurance waiver. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=51.0s)]
*  This might really be boring. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=73.0s)]
*  And I say that because I do think the overheated expectation for how this chair and forms this as a country is something that's almost always born to disappoint. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=76.0s)]
*  But I also say it because this isn't something that is unprecedented in the world of criminal law. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=92.0s)]
*  The actual adjudication of cases like this one, as much as we know about what kind of case this is before the indictment is unsealed, the actual adjudication of cases like this is often a very boring thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=101.0s)]
*  I will tell you since this particular district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has been the district attorney for Manhattan, his office has reportedly charged falsification of business records as a felony count 117 times. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=113.0s)]
*  He has not been DA for that long, but in that time, he's indicted on this charge 117 times. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=127.0s)]
*  And that's what you call trivia, because it's not that important. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=135.0s)]
*  Not one of those cases was interesting enough to make the news on its own terms. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=140.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you like him. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=145.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you dislike him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=150.0s)]
*  What matters is whether he is a danger to the country because he will do it again. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=153.0s)]
*  And none of us can have confidence based on his record that he will not do it again because he is telling us every day that he will. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=162.0s)]
*  California Congressman Adam Schiff led the first impeachment of then President Trump over his withholding military aid to Ukraine and attempting to pressure that country into announcing an investigation into Trump's political rival, Joe Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=172.0s)]
*  After repeatedly surrounding, excuse me, after repeatedly sounding the alarm about Trump's behaviors, if left in office and if never held accountable, Congressman Schiff played a pivotal role in the January 6th investigation in Congress and Trump's role in it all. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=186.0s)]
*  Joining us now is a man who has been telling us this was coming for a long time. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=202.0s)]
*  California Congressman Adam Schiff, lead impeachment manager for the first impeachment, former member of the January 6th investigation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=207.0s)]
*  Sir, thanks for being with us tonight. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=213.0s)]
*  It's nice to see you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=215.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=216.0s)]
*  Let me just ask you your top line reaction to this news. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=219.0s)]
*  At one level, this is a relatively run of the mill, white collar crime indictment that we believe is about to be unsealed in New York in coming days. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=223.0s)]
*  On the other hand, this is history. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=233.0s)]
*  It's the first time a former president has faced criminal charges of any kind. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=235.0s)]
*  It is, you know, a sad and sobering historic day in the life of our country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=240.0s)]
*  The first time a president was indicted for criminal charges. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=245.0s)]
*  It is also, I think, a vindication of the rule of law and the principle that people should be held accountable, whether they're rich and powerful, whether they're presidents or former presidents, or whether they're ordinary citizens that prosecutors should follow the evidence. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=249.0s)]
*  And if someone needs to go to jail because they were directed in a criminal scheme, then the person that did the directing should also be held to account. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=263.0s)]
*  But at the same time, it is worrying to see once again, Donald Trump engage in inciting his supporters, essentially threatening death and destruction if he were indicted, as he has now been. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=271.0s)]
*  And it demonstrates, I think, the continuing peril to the country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=286.0s)]
*  I would just say it would be more perilous if we didn't observe the rule of law, if we bred disrespect for the law, if we treated him differently, that would be more dangerous. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=291.0s)]
*  And so this is necessary. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=302.0s)]
*  But obviously, it's a momentous and tragic day. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=304.0s)]
*  Do you have anything by way of lessons learned as somebody who has been personally targeted by Trump and his supporters because of your efforts in trying to hold him accountable and trying to investigate things that he's been involved in? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=309.0s)]
*  I mean, you and all the January 6 committee members all ended up having to get security during that investigation and during Trump's response to that investigation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=324.0s)]
*  You've been through several rounds of this as sort of Trump's public enemy number one in various instances. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=334.0s)]
*  Any lessons learned for a whole new batch of Americans who's about to go through that same process? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=340.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't know whether this is a lesson learned, but it is certainly a cause for great concern. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=346.0s)]
*  And that is it's one thing for members of Congress who are used to being in the public eye to acclimate to being the subject of a violent threat and dangers and risks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=352.0s)]
*  It's another it's going to be very much another thing for an ordinary citizen of New York who gets elected to sit on this jury. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=364.0s)]
*  And I do worry about the extraordinary pressure that those ordinary citizens doing their duty will face. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=372.0s)]
*  And I would say every effort will be made to protect them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=380.0s)]
*  It's tragic that that is necessary in this country. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=385.0s)]
*  But, you know, while it began with threats to members of Congress, we now see school board members threatened. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=389.0s)]
*  We see city council members and county supervisors simply for doing their job. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=395.0s)]
*  And now we will likely see jurors who are also the subject of threats. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=400.0s)]
*  And so anticipating that we need to take steps to protect everyone. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=405.0s)]
*  And we also, I think, need to get across the message. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=410.0s)]
*  Let the courts decide this. This isn't a cause for celebration on the one hand. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=414.0s)]
*  It's not a cause that never is for violence on the other. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=418.0s)]
*  We will get through this, but we're going to have to be careful. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=421.0s)]
*  California Congressman Adam Schiff, lead impeachment manager in the first of Trump's two impeachments, member of the January 6 investigation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=427.0s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. Really appreciate you being here tonight. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=434.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=437.0s)]
*  There is word from one of Trump's lawyers that President Trump is expected to be arraigned. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=439.0s)]
*  That means he's expected to be that we expect him to turn himself in to be booked on these charges on Tuesday next week. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=444.0s)]
*  But who knows? Because that gets us to the one actually completely off the rails thing that has happened today. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=454.0s)]
*  The one break the rules, break the system thing that has happened today since this indictment was first reported by the New York Times. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=462.0s)]
*  And it relates to the fuzziness of that specific part of the plan. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=471.0s)]
*  The way it logistically works for a person to be indicted on felony charges. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=476.0s)]
*  Specifically, the question of Trump turning himself in to face arraignment. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=482.0s)]
*  There is one thing that has happened today, not the indictment itself. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=487.0s)]
*  The thing that has happened today that does potentially pose a threat to us as a country is something that somebody completely outside this story, completely outside this criminal process, completely outside this news decided to do in response to it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=491.0s)]
*  And that is something that happened within five minutes of Trump's lawyer first putting out the first statement to reporters that Trump would turn himself in for arraignment early next week. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=509.0s)]
*  We got one Trump lawyer telling reporters early next week Trump will turn himself in. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=521.0s)]
*  Within five minutes of that first statement from Trump's lawyer, a Republican politician named Ron DeSantis, who is the governor of Florida, made this statement online. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=527.0s)]
*  Saying Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=537.0s)]
*  And that's some of the verbiage in this statement from Ron DeSantis that echoes word for word what Donald Trump said in response to his own indictment today. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=548.0s)]
*  He's echoing Trump's language exactly, which is fine. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=558.0s)]
*  Criticizing the legal process, criticizing the indictment, criticizing your perceived political enemies, calling for your supporters to blah blah blah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=561.0s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=568.0s)]
*  Saying that the legal process for extraditing somebody from one state to another is something that will not be followed. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=569.0s)]
*  The Florida governor, Trump, decides that he's not going to turn himself in, that he's going to stay in Florida and come and get me. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=579.0s)]
*  Florida is not going to allow that process to go forward because it's a former president, because it's Donald Trump. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=584.0s)]
*  Well, that could break us. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=593.0s)]
*  I mean, indicting a president, indicting a politician is a normal thing in this country. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=596.0s)]
*  Trying to say the legal system no longer applies in this country if you try to apply it to our political guy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=602.0s)]
*  That is something that can break the rule of law in this country. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=609.0s)]
*  That is something, I mean, if anything, is the first proverbial shot at Fort Sumter today. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=612.0s)]
*  That shot was fired not by Donald Trump, but by Ron DeSantis. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=616.0s)]
*  Joining us now is David Rode. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=620.0s)]
*  He's executive editor for News at the New Yorker dot com. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=623.0s)]
*  He's the author of the book In Deep, which details the lengths that Bill Barr went to protect Donald Trump at the U.S. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=625.0s)]
*  Justice Department, which ultimately in some ways is what got us here today. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=632.0s)]
*  David, it's nice to see you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=637.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=638.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=639.0s)]
*  Do you think it is fair to see this indictment today as the sort of fruit that was grown on the tree that was Bill Barr? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=640.0s)]
*  When Bill Barr came in basically to try to protect Trump at the U.S. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=655.0s)]
*  Justice Department, did that effectively set in motion the chain of events and the timeline that led to this indictment today? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=660.0s)]
*  It did. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=667.0s)]
*  And it's partly this, you know, crazy theory that, you know, sitting presidents cannot be indicted. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=668.0s)]
*  This Office of Legal Counsel opinion in the Justice Department that came up so many times in the Mueller investigation, it came up again in the Cohen case. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=674.0s)]
*  And I, you know, if we had a more functional Congress, you know, that would be, I think, a reform that would maybe help our democracy. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=682.0s)]
*  And I think that, you know, presidents, you know, aren't immune from prosecution or investigation in all forms by the Justice Department while they're in office. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=691.0s)]
*  But now we are here today. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=699.0s)]
*  You know, was Trump clearly in that in the court papers when Cohen pled guilty, Trump was individual one. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=701.0s)]
*  Can Alvin Bragg convince a Manhattan jury that that was true beyond a reasonable doubt? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=707.0s)]
*  And you mentioned the threats and we can talk about that more. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=714.0s)]
*  But that is the concern here. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=717.0s)]
*  I think the legal player in this trial is going to be the judge. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=718.0s)]
*  And how do you give Donald Trump a fair trial? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=721.0s)]
*  I completely agreed with what was said earlier by Andrew. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=724.0s)]
*  Let's calm down. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=728.0s)]
*  Let's let the system work. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=730.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump is acquitted, that's fine. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=731.0s)]
*  That's the way our system works. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=734.0s)]
*  But I'm very concerned about how can a judge make this a fair trial without making it a crazy trial where jurors feel intimidated? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=736.0s)]
*  Well, David, I know you spoke with prosecutors who have handled cases against Trump allies, particularly Trump allies who are sort of cut from the same cloth as he is like people like Roger Stone. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=746.0s)]
*  What did they tell you? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=758.0s)]
*  What do you think we can extrapolate from those earlier cases in terms of how this one might go? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=760.0s)]
*  So when Trump is arraigned, he will be released on bail. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=766.0s)]
*  And that's normal. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=769.0s)]
*  That's for any, I think, you know, nonviolent crime. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=770.0s)]
*  But there's a series of conditions he then agrees to with the judge so that he can be out on bail and so he can participate in the trial. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=772.0s)]
*  He's got to obey what the judge tells him. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=780.0s)]
*  And what happened in the Roger Stone trial, this is the sort of famous dirty trickster and Trump ally back to the Richard Nixon era. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=783.0s)]
*  At one point during Roger Stone's trial, he posted a picture of the judge in his case. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=791.0s)]
*  And there was a crosshairs like a target beside her face. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=797.0s)]
*  She then and it's her right as a judge and judges can do this with the defendant. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=801.0s)]
*  She issued a partial gag order that barred Roger Stone from posting anything online regarding that trial. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=805.0s)]
*  You can imagine what would happen if Donald Trump, if a judge in the upcoming trial were to limit his ability to speak online. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=814.0s)]
*  And the most extreme step that a judge could take. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=822.0s)]
*  And this is the issue here. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=826.0s)]
*  If he is intimidating jurors with threats of violence, they can revoke his bail. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=828.0s)]
*  So that's why the judge is such a critical player in this. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=834.0s)]
*  Frankly, it's in Donald Trump's interest to stay calm and to act calmly and sanely and say, I'm not afraid of this trial. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=837.0s)]
*  I trust this system. I trust jurors. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=845.0s)]
*  But he certainly doesn't have a history of that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=848.0s)]
*  Andrew, what a day. Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=852.0s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=855.0s)]
*  Did it make your hair stand up the wrong way or did it irk you otherwise when I said that this is likely to be boring? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=859.0s)]
*  I believe that this these charges, what we what we expect them to be and what we have seen of other charges even brought against Donald Trump in Manhattan, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=869.0s)]
*  criminal court, I feel like we ought to let people know that this might be something that is sort of like watching paint dry, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=878.0s)]
*  that this might be a little boring as a prosecutor who's bought plenty of white collar cases. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=884.0s)]
*  Does that bother you? Did I offend you? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=889.0s)]
*  We certainly didn't offend me, Rachel. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=892.0s)]
*  You know, I think there are a couple of points. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=895.0s)]
*  One, no matter how much one anticipates a day like this, when it actually happens, there's I think for anybody, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=899.0s)]
*  there's a certain amount that it sinks in what this means. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=908.0s)]
*  I totally agree with you that a former president is not immune and can be subject to charges. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=913.0s)]
*  But it is the case that this has never happened before. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=919.0s)]
*  But to your point about this now being boring, I think this goes to something you were saying. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=922.0s)]
*  It's sort of the flip side of that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=927.0s)]
*  We shouldn't be thinking of a former president differently. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=930.0s)]
*  And because of that, the boring aspect that is about to happen, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=933.0s)]
*  which is this enormous time delay between an indictment and a trial, is actually part of the rule of law. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=938.0s)]
*  So for all of those people who've been waiting anxiously to see the former president held to account criminally for his conduct, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=946.0s)]
*  part of that means that you have to be patient because the rule of law that brought us to today [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=954.0s)]
*  requires that any defendant, no matter whether you like them or don't like them, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=960.0s)]
*  is entitled to time to prepare, to get the evidence from the government, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=965.0s)]
*  to think about what kind of defense they want to mount, to make motions challenging the charges. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=972.0s)]
*  All of that is part of the rule of law. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=979.0s)]
*  And people are entitled to that no matter if it's a small crime, whether it's John Gotti. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=982.0s)]
*  Everyone is entitled to that process, and it's a long process. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=988.0s)]
*  Just take one data point. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=991.0s)]
*  The Trump Organization that you referred to, it took 16 months for that to go from indictment to trial. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=993.0s)]
*  So it is a long process, but that process is what it means to be part of the American criminal justice system. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1001.0s)]
*  And I think from the point of view of your perspective, having been a prosecutor, having been inside that process, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1008.0s)]
*  presenting that as time to prepare, time to properly litigate the motions and things about the venue and jurisdiction [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1015.0s)]
*  and what evidence is invisible and all those things, that all completely makes sense. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1022.0s)]
*  I will also say just as an observer, it seems to me that it's not in the letter of the law, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1026.0s)]
*  but part of the spirit of due process is also that the law be administered in a way that is dispassionate, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1032.0s)]
*  that is not in a hurry, that is not unduly delayed, but that is also not something that is meted out in the heat of the moment [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1038.0s)]
*  or carried along in terms of public sentiment and a sense of drama. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1046.0s)]
*  And the delay that you're talking about that we saw in the Trump Organization trial, which is proper, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1051.0s)]
*  the delay that you can expect in most trials that are like this because that's what it takes to do it properly, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1057.0s)]
*  also has the effect, I think, for everybody who's watching that trial, however closely they're watching it, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1062.0s)]
*  for whatever reasons, whatever strong feelings they have for or against the defendant or the prosecution, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1068.0s)]
*  that time is sort of a cooling saucer here in terms of making sure that people aren't dragging their emotions into this. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1073.0s)]
*  And I feel, I mean, the reason I'm highlighting that I think this is going to be boring is because I think that's good news for the country, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1082.0s)]
*  that this isn't something that things are going to, that we're not going to side this on a run. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1090.0s)]
*  This is now something that's going to be done dispassionately, coldly and by the book. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1093.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And the argument is, this is from the sort of Trump team, is that this is selective prosecution, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1099.0s)]
*  that Allen Bragg acted politically, and it's really important to see that he is treated like everyone else. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1107.0s)]
*  Remember, this is a DA who initially said no to the charges. They're not ready. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1114.0s)]
*  That's a sign of certainly not having selective prosecution, that he thought that we're not going to bring a case until it's absolutely ready. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1120.0s)]
*  And we're treating him just like we would anyone else, as you mentioned, with charges that are routinely brought in New York. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1128.0s)]
*  So you're not treating a former president with sort of more weight than anyone else or less weight, just like everyone else. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1134.0s)]
*  And that means that this process is going to be one where there isn't a sort of show trial or a kangaroo court, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1143.0s)]
*  where it's really important for Americans to see and for the world to see that the rule of law here can work in a way that I think for many people, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1151.0s)]
*  including myself, I think many people were giving up hope that there would be accountability. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1161.0s)]
*  And then that process plays out. And if Donald Trump can win in the sense that the government has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1167.0s)]
*  that is the way the system is supposed to work. That is the rule of law at play. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1178.0s)]
*  And we have to have faith in the same system that led to today in watching this go forward. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1182.0s)]
*  . [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKDLZZXjYAo&t=1227.0s)]
