# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 3
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08)
*  All these latest revelations about the plot to overthrow the election, the stuff about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=0.0s)]
*  taking the voting machines, taking the election machinery, it keeps coming up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=3.96s)]
*  And again, this is one of those things like the fake slates of electors that they forged. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=9.8s)]
*  It's one of those things that seems random, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=13.56s)]
*  It seems like a bizarre world, sort of inexplicable sidebar to the overall plot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=16.68s)]
*  But apparently they were really fixated on it and they worked really hard on it from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=21.6s)]
*  like five different angles in ways that are only now starting to become clear. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=25.52s)]
*  Last week it was Politico.com that was first to obtain this executive order apparently [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=30.36s)]
*  prepared for Trump that would have authorized the military to go around the country seizing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=33.96s)]
*  voting machines. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=38.28s)]
*  CNN then reported that it wasn't just the military that was the target of this draft [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=39.28s)]
*  executive order. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=43.28s)]
*  There was another one, a similar one, that laid out essentially the same scheme but would [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=44.28s)]
*  have authorized the Homeland Security Department to seize the voting machines instead of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  military. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=51.36s)]
*  Then the New York Times newly reported this week that Trump personally directed his lawyer, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=52.68s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, to call the Homeland Security Department to try to get the scheme enacted, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=57.04s)]
*  to ask that Homeland Security orchestrate the seizing of voting machines and election [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=62.24s)]
*  machines in multiple states. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=66.36s)]
*  So we know this wasn't some out of left field, freelance, harebrained idea presented to Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=68.44s)]
*  that he never considered or that he rejected. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=74.64s)]
*  We know from New York Times reporting that Trump actually told somebody to call Homeland [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=77.2s)]
*  Security and get this done. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=80.96s)]
*  The Times also reports that Trump made the ask personally to a different federal department. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  In an Oval Office meeting per the New York Times this week, Trump asked Attorney General [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  William Barr to have the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  Justice Department go out, fan out all over the country and go seize voting machines, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  go seize elections equipment. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=99.16s)]
*  But even that wasn't the extent of it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=102.0s)]
*  There was more. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=104.44s)]
*  And it was reported widely and publicly at the time that President Trump was inviting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=105.44s)]
*  a whole delegation of Republican lawmakers from Michigan to come to the Oval Office and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=110.72s)]
*  meet with him personally in the White House. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=115.08s)]
*  This was happening while he was publicly invading against the Michigan election results and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=117.4s)]
*  insisting he must have won that state and it all must have been stolen from him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=121.38s)]
*  Again, this was November 20th. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=124.88s)]
*  It's totally clear what was going on, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  This is right after the election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=129.0s)]
*  It's two and a half weeks after the election. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=130.6s)]
*  Trump was not only disputing Biden's victory in Michigan at the time, he was publicly trying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=132.56s)]
*  to pressure local election officials in Michigan counties that went for Biden that they shouldn't [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=136.28s)]
*  certify the election results in those counties. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=140.56s)]
*  It was widely speculated at the time that he had invited those Republican lawmakers [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=142.68s)]
*  from Michigan to rope them in on this scheme he was pushing to overthrow the government, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  to pressure them to go back home to Michigan and somehow use their authority as state lawmakers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  to undo the Biden victory in the state of Michigan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=156.24s)]
*  Those lawmakers spent nearly two hours with Trump inside the White House that day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  The Detroit News reported at the time that they were all in quote that they were all [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=163.52s)]
*  They were all quote laughing and in good spirits when they left after their meeting with the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=171.72s)]
*  Democratic activists actually projected photos of the Michigan Republican leaders who had [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=172.72s)]
*  met with Trump that day. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  While the president is actively and publicly trying to overthrow the election results in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Michigan, they projected their photos on the outside of the Trump hotel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=183.76s)]
*  Well after their White House meeting, those two Republican leaders who had their faces [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  projected in the outside of the hotel, they put out a statement saying they had no information [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=193.0s)]
*  that would change the outcome of the election. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=198.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=200.12s)]
*  They never really said what happened in that meeting. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=202.12s)]
*  Same goes for a near identical meeting that Trump held with Republican lawmakers from [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=204.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania around the same time, five days later. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  He brought a group of Pennsylvania Republicans to D.C. just in late December, excuse me, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  in late November as well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, you might remember earlier this week, the New York Times reported when they were [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  reporting on the seize the voting machines plans. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=226.0s)]
*  They reported that not only had Trump entertained and advanced these plans to have Homeland [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=228.0s)]
*  Security or the U.S. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=234.0s)]
*  Justice Department go out and seize the voting machines, the Times also reported that he [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=236.0s)]
*  had personally tried to persuade state lawmakers from Michigan and Pennsylvania that they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=240.0s)]
*  should use local law enforcement agencies to take control of voting machines in their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=246.0s)]
*  states. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=250.0s)]
*  The New York Times reporters who broke that story this week, and they gave us this, I [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=252.92s)]
*  think, important clarification. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=256.92s)]
*  They told us that their sources confirmed to them that, in fact, that's what those Oval [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=258.92s)]
*  Office meetings were about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=262.92s)]
*  That Trump did discuss this idea of seizing the voting machines in Michigan and seizing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=264.92s)]
*  the voting machines in Pennsylvania during those two separate Oval Office meetings with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=270.92s)]
*  Michigan and Pennsylvania lawmakers in November 2020. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=276.92s)]
*  This was a federally driven plot, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=278.92s)]
*  Efforts enacted and directed personally by the president himself that those voting machines [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  in swing states had to be seized. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  It does not appear that those efforts by, including President Trump personally, doesn't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  appear that those efforts succeeded. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  But here's the thing about a criminal conspiracy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  For a conspiracy to work, it does not necessarily have to be the people who you directly told [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  to do it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  If you make it clear enough that you want it done, in this case, if you make it clear [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=308.76s)]
*  enough that you want those voting machines seized, you want them physically taken, if [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=312.76s)]
*  you make it clear enough, well, you know, hey, anybody can join in on your conspiracy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=316.76s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=322.76s)]
*  This is a piece of this puzzle that is worth scrutiny. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=324.76s)]
*  Thanks to an email obtained by a nonprofit news organization called Bridge Michigan, we [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=330.76s)]
*  know there was at least one person in local law enforcement in Michigan who tried to carry [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=335.68s)]
*  out or who seems to have been trying to carry out Trump's scheme that the voting machines [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=341.68s)]
*  needed to be seized. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=347.68s)]
*  The lawyer for the sheriff of Berry County, Michigan wrote to Sidney Powell, quote, My [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=349.68s)]
*  client, the Berry County sheriff, called me and I instructed him to put the machines and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=353.68s)]
*  the ballots in the evidence room. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=358.68s)]
*  He's done that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=360.68s)]
*  We're trying to get the same thing to happen next county over in Kalamazoo. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=363.6s)]
*  I don't know if we can get the sheriff in Kalamazoo to seize voting machines and ballots [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=367.6s)]
*  in that county, but if we could, a comparison of the machines could yield some potential [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=371.6s)]
*  forensics. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=375.6s)]
*  Attaching the unofficial results tabulation for Berry County, again, my client has apparently [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=377.6s)]
*  taken all the machines and ballots into evidence. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=381.6s)]
*  The local sheriff has taken all the ballots and all the machines into evidence? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=387.6s)]
*  He has? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  Somebody actually tried it? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  The attorney for that sheriff put it in writing, put it in an email to Sidney Powell that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  they had done that in Berry County, Michigan. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  We tried contacting the attorney who sent that email. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  He won't talk to us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  Maybe he'll change his mind, call us back. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  We did actually, though, manage to talk to the Berry County sheriff himself. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Sheriff Dar Leif is his name. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  He told us he has no idea why his lawyer sent that email to Trump election conspiracy lawyer [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=419.44s)]
*  Sidney Powell. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=425.44s)]
*  Sheriff Leif denies that he ever seized any voting machines or that he put voting machines [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=427.44s)]
*  and ballots into the evidence room like his lawyer says he did. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=431.44s)]
*  But Sheriff Leif did confirm that he reached out to other Michigan sheriffs in what appears [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=435.44s)]
*  to be a related scheme or at least around related ideas. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=441.44s)]
*  This is what he told us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=446.36s)]
*  He said, quote, I made a phone call to see if there were voting incidents in their counties [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=448.36s)]
*  that could justify seizing the voting machines. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=452.36s)]
*  He says he didn't find any. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=454.36s)]
*  But he was making phone calls to other sheriffs trying to find a good enough reason to do [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=456.36s)]

*  This story is just insane. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=462.36s)]
*  It's playing out in part this week in court. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=464.36s)]
*  This is one that's out of a place called Cross Village Township in Michigan, which is at [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=466.36s)]
*  the very tippy top of the Mitten, if you think of the lower peninsula as the Mitten. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  In January 2021, so right after the election, a woman from Cross Village Township phoned [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  up a guy who ran a computer technician business. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  The woman said she was calling from something called the Election Integrity Commission [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  and she was working to collect voting data from voting machines all across the state [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  of Michigan. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  She told him that she needed his help. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  According to her, there was one voting machine in the state that she was having trouble [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  accessing, the one in Cross Village Township, which is where she's from. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=501.2s)]
*  She said the machine was not connected to the internet so she could not access the data. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=505.2s)]
*  She needed him to physically go to the machine, make a copy of all the data on it, and then [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=510.2s)]
*  bring that data back to her before the machine was, quote, wiped clean in routine maintenance. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  According to the local press, following this woman's instructions, that computer technician [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  and two other men actually tried to do it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  He showed up in mid-January 2021 to the Township Community Center where the election machine [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=531.12s)]
*  was held. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=535.12s)]
*  Two of the men were inexplicably wearing bulletproof vests. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=536.12s)]
*  One of them was carrying a gun. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=539.12s)]
*  The computer technician was brought to the room where the voting machine was being kept. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=541.12s)]
*  He said it appeared as if the door to the room where the voting machine was kept had [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=548.12s)]
*  been tampered with. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=552.12s)]
*  He then proceeded. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=553.12s)]
*  He then proceeded to remove the computer from inside the voting machine. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=555.12s)]
*  He says he noticed that the screws on the computer had been stripped. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=561.04s)]
*  It was then that he realized he did not have the right kind of connector to be able to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=566.04s)]
*  download the data onto his thumb drive so he was not able to make the copy of the machine [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=570.04s)]
*  that that woman who said she was from the Election Integrity Commission wanted. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=575.04s)]
*  Here's the thing, though. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=580.04s)]
*  There's no such thing as the Election Integrity Commission. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=581.04s)]
*  This woman had no authority to send men in bulletproof vests with a gun to go manhandle [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=584.04s)]
*  that voting machine in Michigan like that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=589.9599999999999s)]
*  But this actually happened. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  We know all of this because this woman has now been arrested in connection with this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=593.9599999999999s)]
*  incident on charges of common law fraud and aiding and abetting the unauthorized access [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  of a computer. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=601.9599999999999s)]
*  She was just in court this week as her case proceeds. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  She's told authorities that the reason she sent those armed men to go get the voting [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=604.9599999999999s)]
*  machine in her town is because she heard there was data on a satellite owned by the Vatican. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=608.9599999999999s)]
*  And that would show that there was voter fraud in the 2020 election. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  She needed that data on the voting machine to prove the Vatican plot. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=618.88s)]
*  That Italy hacked the voting machine thing, that Vatican satellite thing, that is one [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=623.88s)]
*  of the weirder conspiracies pushed by the people in Donald Trump's orbit to justify [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=630.88s)]
*  overturning the results of this election. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=634.88s)]
*  You see what I mean? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=636.88s)]
*  You don't have to explicitly instruct your minions to carry out the conspiracy. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=637.88s)]
*  Talk about it enough and people will just join in. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=643.88s)]
*  What do these four people all have in common? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=648.88s)]
*  You might recognize some of them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=651.88s)]
*  You might not. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=653.88s)]
*  But what they do have in common is something pretty specific. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=654.88s)]
*  All four of these men were all found guilty of committing voter fraud in the 2020 election. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=660.88s)]
*  The gentleman in the upper left, he's a Republican from Nevada. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=666.88s)]
*  His wife died several years ago. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=669.88s)]
*  He nevertheless filled out her ballot and cast it in the presidential election. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=671.88s)]
*  He participated in efforts with the Nevada Republican Party to claim that his dead wife's [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=677.8s)]
*  ballot being cast in the election must mean there was mass voter fraud by Democrats. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=681.8s)]
*  He is the one who cast his dead wife's ballot. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=687.8s)]
*  He's a Republican. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=690.8s)]
*  He got caught. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=691.8s)]
*  He was sentenced to probation. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=692.8s)]
*  That's the guy in the upper left. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=695.8s)]
*  Guy in the upper right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=696.8s)]
*  He's a Republican elected official from Ohio. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=698.8s)]
*  In this case, it was his father who died and he cast his dead father's ballot in the 2020 election. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=701.7199999999999s)]
*  That Ohio Republican official was sentenced to a grand total of three days in jail. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  Keep going clockwise. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=712.7199999999999s)]
*  The gentleman on the lower right, he's from Pennsylvania. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=714.7199999999999s)]
*  In his case, it was his mother who had died. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=717.7199999999999s)]
*  He nevertheless cast her ballot for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=720.7199999999999s)]
*  He was caught. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  He got probation. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=725.7199999999999s)]
*  And then the last guy lower left there. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=727.7199999999999s)]
*  He was a Pennsylvania Republican whose mother also died. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=730.64s)]
*  Apparently he couldn't help himself. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=732.64s)]
*  He cast a ballot in her name in the 2020 election. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=734.64s)]
*  He got caught. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=737.64s)]
*  He got probation. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=738.64s)]
*  Now this is Pamela Moses of Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=740.64s)]
*  This week, Ms. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=744.64s)]
*  Moses was also sentenced for a crime related to her efforts to vote in the 2020 election. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=745.64s)]
*  Ms. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=751.64s)]
*  Moses had a felony conviction in Tennessee that legally resulted in her not being allowed [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=752.64s)]
*  to vote again in that state. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=760.56s)]
*  But she says that nobody ever told her that that particular conviction meant that she [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=762.56s)]
*  couldn't vote. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=766.56s)]
*  And moreover, her county elections board never took her off the voter rolls. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=768.56s)]
*  In 2019, when she discovered she had been declared ineligible to vote, she sought formally [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=772.56s)]
*  to have her voting rights restored. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=778.56s)]
*  As part of her effort to do that, she went to the probation office and she asked them [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=780.56s)]
*  if she was off probation and eligible to have her voting rights restored. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=784.56s)]
*  She was able to submit a certificate saying so, which she could submit with her voter [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=789.4799999999999s)]
*  registration application. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, here's what happened next. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=794.4799999999999s)]
*  This is from reporter April Thompson at WREGTV in Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=796.4799999999999s)]
*  This application to have her voting rights restored was filled out for her and approved [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=802.4799999999999s)]
*  by the Department of Corrections officials on September 3rd, 2019. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=807.4799999999999s)]
*  Staff from the Shelby County Election Commission even signed off on the application. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=811.4799999999999s)]
*  A letter came dated September 4th, 2019, a day later saying, wait a minute, they were wrong. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=817.4s)]
*  I relied on the Election Commission because those are the people who are supposed to know [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=824.4s)]
*  what, you know, you're supposed to do. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=828.4s)]
*  See how crazy this is? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=832.4s)]
*  The Department of Corrections signed off on her voting application. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=834.4s)]
*  So did the County Election Commission. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=837.4s)]
*  But apparently they screwed up and technically she wasn't eligible after all. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=839.4s)]
*  But for submitting that certificate that they screwed up and trying to register to vote, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  Pamela Moses was arrested and charged and convicted and is now sentenced to six years [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  in prison for illegally trying to register to vote. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  The judge in her case, I'm not kidding, said in court that Pamela Moses tricked the probation [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  department into giving her the certificate saying she was eligible to vote. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh, she tricked them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=870.24s)]
*  She's a sorceress, maybe? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=872.24s)]
*  What's the big difference between Pam Moses in Tennessee and all those other guys who [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=875.24s)]
*  actually cast illegal ballots in the name of relatives they definitely knew were dead? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=879.24s)]
*  All of those guys got probation in one case, three days in jail. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=886.24s)]
*  She got six years in prison for trying to register to vote after she had received an [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=889.24s)]
*  official certificate from the probation department telling her it was okay if she registered [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=896.16s)]
*  to vote. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=901.16s)]
*  Six years in prison is her sentence. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=902.16s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=907.16s)]
*  Joining us now is Janay Nelson. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=909.16s)]
*  She's Associate Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=911.16s)]
*  She will be taking over as president of LDF next month. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=914.16s)]
*  Ms. Nelson, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=917.16s)]

*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=922.16s)]

*  I am surprised that this is not a bigger story nationwide because this strikes me as bald [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=929.0799999999999s)]

*  I'll just say that as my opinion. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  As an attorney, as somebody who knows things like this very, very well, given your work [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  at LDF, is there something here that I am missing? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  Is there some subtlety or some nuance or piece of this that makes this less outrageous than [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  it seems? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=954.0s)]
*  No, it is absolutely as outrageous as you describe it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=955.0s)]
*  It points to everything that is wrong in our democracy. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=959.0s)]
*  It's a confluence of racial discrimination and voter suppression. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=963.0s)]
*  And we have to ask the question, why do we have laws that prohibit people with felony [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=968.0s)]
*  convictions from voting in the first place? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=973.0s)]
*  This case is emblematic of all the reasons that we need to do away with those arcane [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=976.0s)]
*  laws that ultimately disenfranchise 5.2 million Americans. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=983.92s)]
*  And black Americans in particular are disenfranchised at a rate of four times every other race combined. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=989.92s)]
*  And what you just pointed out in terms of the individuals who are known to have committed [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=998.16s)]
*  voter fraud, blatant voter fraud, not because of misinformation, not because of a clerical [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1003.92s)]
*  or administrative error on the part of the state, as we've seen in so many cases like [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1009.72s)]
*  Mrs. Moses', but people who intentionally committed voter fraud, they are sentenced [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1013.84s)]
*  to probation. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1019.08s)]
*  And individuals like Mrs. Moses, like Crystal Mason out of Texas, whose case was similarly [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1020.08s)]
*  troublesome in this way, like Herbis Rogers, another person out of Texas who was sentenced [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1027.08s)]
*  to prison because of a mistaken belief about his right to vote. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1034.48s)]
*  It shows that there are two systems, there are two criminal justice systems, two sentencing [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1039.44s)]
*  systems when it comes to these issues. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1043.8600000000001s)]
*  And you could not ask for a more stark contrast about justice in our country. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1046.44s)]
*  In the case of Mrs. Moses in Tennessee, she's a voting rights activist. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1054.2s)]
*  She has been an advocate for the African-American community. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1059.3200000000002s)]
*  She's been a candidate for office. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1062.68s)]
*  She's somebody who shows up at public meetings and is sort of a well-known public figure [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1064.0s)]
*  and activist in Memphis. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1067.76s)]
*  I also took note of the fact that in this case, despite the facts of it, as we've been [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1070.24s)]
*  talking about, the prosecutor in this case has been press releasing the heck out of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1077.36s)]
*  this in terms of the prosecution itself, the revocation of her bond. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1081.8s)]
*  So she's actually been in jail. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1088.08s)]
*  They held her through the holidays. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1090.08s)]
*  She's been in jail since December, awaiting trial for this terrible, awaiting sentencing [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1091.92s)]
*  for this terrible crime. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1097.24s)]
*  And then when the six-year sentence was handed down, the prosecutor has been crowing about [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1099.16s)]
*  this with press releases as if this is something that deserves national attention in a positive [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1102.52s)]
*  way. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1109.24s)]
*  I wonder if there is some element of this that we should see, not just in terms of its [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1110.24s)]
*  strict legal consequences, but the way this fits into efforts to hype claims of voter [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1116.24s)]
*  fraud in order to justify the kinds of voter-suppressive tactics that you were describing. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1121.76s)]
*  Yes, I think there is an absolute campaign to drum up the idea and the notion that there [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1127.32s)]
*  are individuals out there who are attempting to vote intentionally when they don't have [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1133.6s)]
*  the right to vote. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1137.32s)]
*  But if we look at the record of Amy Weier, she has a record that is riddled with allegations [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1138.32s)]
*  of misconduct. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1145.2s)]
*  And if you look at the facts of this case and look closely at all of the evidence about [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1146.92s)]
*  the efforts that Mrs. Moses made to clarify her status and her ability to vote, there [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1153.36s)]
*  are many questions that I have about whether these are charges that should have been brought [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1159.8799999999999s)]
*  in the first place, whether this prosecution should have moved forward, and certainly whether [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1165.8799999999999s)]
*  the sentence she received is an appropriate one. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1170.6399999999999s)]
*  Everything in this case smacks of overreach and an effort to make an example of someone. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1173.8799999999999s)]
*  As I said, we've seen this in many cases before, and you have individuals who, like the Tarrant [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1180.36s)]
*  County Justice of the Peace Russ Casey out of Texas, who admitted to forging signatures [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1188.8799999999999s)]
*  to get on a primary ballot, and he received probation. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1195.96s)]
*  You contrast that to individuals who are trying to exercise the fundamental right to vote, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1199.48s)]
*  and we want to criminalize that effort. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1205.36s)]
*  There's something very wrong with a democracy that seeks to excise people from the electorate, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1208.04s)]
*  as opposed to welcoming them back, as opposed to giving people second chances and welcoming [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1214.32s)]
*  them into the electoral process. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tabyv-0eE08&t=1221.28s)]
