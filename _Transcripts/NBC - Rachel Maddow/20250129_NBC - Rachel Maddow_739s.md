# Trump makes laughingstock of America with repeated embarrassments in early days of new term
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI)
*  Right. In any case, there is no Trump family crest. But there is a crest that was on the wall [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=0.0s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago when Trump bought Mar-a-Lago, when he bought that house in Florida in the 1980s. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=11.44s)]
*  And it is somebody else's family crest. It's the family crest of the ex-husband of the lady who [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=19.6s)]
*  built that house. His name was Davies. His family was originally from Wales, and he actually had an [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=26.48s)]
*  official family crest, and that was it. And while he lived at Mar-a-Lago, because he was married to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=33.52s)]
*  the woman who owned Mar-a-Lago, he put up his family crest on the wall as a decoration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=38.72s)]
*  And then in what was perhaps a critical error, he apparently neglected to take it down when he left, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=46.08s)]
*  and the family ultimately sold the house. And so when Donald Trump moved in there in the 1980s, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=53.28s)]
*  the crest was still there, and Donald Trump took it. He took that other guy's family crest and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=58.96s)]
*  proclaimed it as the Trump family crest. It is not theirs. It has nothing to do with them at all. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=66.56s)]
*  Now, the Davies family, whose crest it actually was, they were apparently horrified that Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=75.04s)]
*  took it down and started using it as if it was his own. They were particularly horrified when it [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=80.96s)]
*  turned out that Trump did make one change to the crest, because in addition to all the decorative [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  and symbolic elements, the dragons and stuff, the crest did have one word on it written across the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=95.44s)]
*  bottom and that little sort of swoopy scroll. You can see it there on the right. Trump did make a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=104.56s)]
*  change to that. He erased that word in the little scroll and instead just put the word Trump there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=110.32s)]
*  The word he erased was integritas, which is how you say integrity in Latin. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  So to sum it up, Donald Trump stole somebody else's family crest without permission and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=125.52s)]
*  then literally removed the integrity and put Trump in instead, instead of integrity. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=131.2s)]
*  Which is an embarrassing thing in terms of like family stuff, but you know what's more embarrassing? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=140.32s)]
*  Since he has started this second term as president of the United States, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump has reportedly intervened personally. He has found the time to take a personal interest [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  in the creation of a new official White House presidential challenge coin. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  You know what a challenge coin is? When the military was the only institution that had [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=165.44s)]
*  challenge coins, they were like a pretty sober and important thing. They were a real sign of respect, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=170.0s)]
*  real symbolic value import meant really meant something to be given one of these things. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=175.52s)]
*  Now all sorts of people and institutions use challenge coins and so they've become more of a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=180.8s)]
*  like an all-purpose tchotchke, like a keepsake. Trump, since he has been president, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=186.0s)]
*  he has reportedly found the time in the midst of everything else that needs to be done when you're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=192.88s)]
*  president. He has found the time to personally choose the design for the official White House [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=196.96s)]
*  challenge coin and he has apparently insisted that it had to have the Trump family crest [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=202.72s)]
*  embossed on the back of it. So now we as a country have an official White House coin [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=209.28s)]
*  that has embossed on it the stolen Joseph Davies family crest, except with the word integrity [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  scratched out and the word Trump there instead. And actually we just found a picture of it tonight [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=223.52s)]
*  after this intervention by Trump was first reported by the Wall Street Journal for the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=229.68s)]
*  White House version of the stolen family crest. They appear to have written in both Donald and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=235.36s)]
*  Trump and not just Trump. So that means it's getting worse over time. There it is, Donald Trump, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  the big one at the top there. Yeah, that's not your family crest. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=251.04s)]
*  We should just note like for future archaeologists who may dig up that particular coin [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=259.44s)]
*  in the ruins of what used to be the American Republic, just want just going to note for the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=263.52s)]
*  record here more than half the country did not sign up for that embarrassment. Also sorry to the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=267.6s)]
*  Davies family. Sorry about your crest. A good remember to take all your stuff and change the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=272.24s)]
*  locks when you move out. You never know who's coming in behind you or what kind of morals they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=277.68s)]
*  might have. So that's embarrassing. Do you know what the BRICS nations are? The BRICS organization [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=281.52s)]
*  of countries. It's an intergovernmental organization of countries and there's all [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=292.0s)]
*  different kinds of these intergovernmental organizations. There's like the G7 and the G20 [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=298.4s)]
*  and there's, you know, OPEC and the African Union and the Arab League. There's also another [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=302.48s)]
*  one of these groups, the intergovernmental group that's called BRICS and they meet every year. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=308.0s)]
*  And last week, President Trump was sitting in the Oval Office. He was talking to reporters for some [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=313.76s)]
*  reason about how mad he was at Spain. He was explaining to reporters that he thought Spain [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=318.16s)]
*  was terrible. Spain should be ashamed of itself. Spain is bad. He said to reporters, quote, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  they are a BRICS nation. Spain. You know what a BRICS nation is? You'll figure it out. But, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=330.56s)]
*  and if the BRICS nations want to do that, that's okay. But we're going to put at least a 100% [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=336.48s)]
*  tariff on the business they do with the United States. He continued, quote, you know what the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=342.08s)]
*  BRICS is, right? You guys know. You know what I'm saying, right? You know what I'm saying. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=347.92s)]
*  Yeah, Spain's really going to get it because Spain is a BRICS nation. You know what I'm saying, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=354.08s)]
*  right? You know what I'm saying. BRICS is an acronym. It stands for the first letters of the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=360.24s)]
*  first five countries that formed the BRICS organization. BRICS, B-R-I-C-S. Brazil, B for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=373.76s)]
*  Brazil, R for Russia, I for India, C for China, S, S-S. What does the S stand for? Does it stand [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  for Spain? No, it does not. The S in BRICS stands for South Africa, not Spain, because [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=387.76s)]
*  South Africa, not Spain, is the S in BRICS, and Spain is not a BRICS country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=398.0s)]
*  And that kind of a mistake is okay if you're a fifth grader, and this is the question in which [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=405.52s)]
*  you flunk your geography quiz. But when you are the president of the United States, sitting there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=409.76s)]
*  in the Oval Office and ranting about one of our close allies saying they're really going to get [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=414.4s)]
*  it, they're going to get 100% tariff because they're a BRICS country, go look it up. You know what I [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=418.32s)]
*  mean. And he is just factually wrong about that, and they are not a BRICS country at all. When [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=425.12s)]
*  you are not a fifth grader and you're the president of the United States and you do something like [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=432.4s)]
*  that, that is a lot of things. It's embarrassing to yourself if you're capable of that. It's also [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=436.0s)]
*  just embarrassing to us as a country that you are the president, making mistakes like that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=446.32s)]
*  I mean, like us having an official White House challenge coin with his fake stolen family crest [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=453.04s)]
*  on it is embarrassing. Him with the whole BRICS rant about Spain, which is not a BRICS country, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=458.16s)]
*  that is also embarrassing. You know, just before he issued blanket pardons to everybody who [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=463.36s)]
*  participated in the attack on the U.S. Congress and assaults on police officers on January 6th, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=470.48s)]
*  Donald Trump, you might remember, said at a press conference that he thought Hezbollah [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=475.68s)]
*  might have been behind the attack on the Capitol. Which is what? He said out loud, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=480.16s)]
*  Hezbollah did January 6th and we really need to look into it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=487.92s)]
*  Okay. Now today, he says that the way Hamas has been able to make bombs in Gaza [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=492.72s)]
*  is that they made their bombs from condoms they obtained from the U.S. government. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=500.48s)]
*  They've used them as a method of making bombs. There is no factual basis for the claim that the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  U.S. government sent condoms to Hamas in Gaza. But even aside from that, how do you think [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=512.0s)]
*  he thinks you make a bomb? And what part of the bomb includes condom? How do you think [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=521.44s)]
*  he thinks you turn a condom into a bomb? He is the president of the United States. Imagine how [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=528.56s)]
*  the rest of the world is laughing at us about him, about this stuff he says. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=535.2s)]
*  He said in a late night online post a couple of nights ago that the U.S. military had, quote, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=543.36s)]
*  entered California and turned on the water. Enjoy the water, California. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  And while California officials, you know, laughed out loud and tried to keep a straight face while [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=555.12s)]
*  they solemnly announced to the public that no, no one had turned on the water because the water [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=561.52s)]
*  wasn't turned off, actually it fell to the poor folks at the Fox News Channel who had to break [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  the news from sources in Donald Trump's own Defense Department that no, actually no, he doesn't know [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  what he's talking about here. He is making this up. The Fox News Pentagon correspondent reporting, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=581.04s)]
*  quote, U.S. defense officials tell me they did not send troops to, quote, turn on the water [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=585.92s)]
*  in California despite President Trump's claims. Oh, God, it's so embarrassing. It's embarrassing [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=590.72s)]
*  every day. Every day, new, embarrassing, just humiliating, own goal, stupid stuff. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=598.48s)]
*  I mean, and it's not just stuff that he's saying or typing out on his, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=606.72s)]
*  you know, device, whatever he's using to post stuff on social media. It's also the stuff that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  his government is doing as its highest priority, right? They're insisting they're only rounding up [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=618.56s)]
*  violent criminals for deportation. Their violent criminal arrests and roundups have been so well [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  planned that the very first one they did not only didn't target a criminal, it targeted a U.S. military [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=629.92s)]
*  veteran who they arrested without a warrant. Trump is plowing ahead with his effort to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=636.4799999999999s)]
*  start a new war maybe or at least start an international crisis by insisting that he is [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=646.4s)]
*  going to seize Greenland to become part of the United States. And he keeps saying he's going to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=651.04s)]
*  do that, but don't worry, they want it. Quote, the people of Greenland would love to become a state [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=655.92s)]
*  of the United States of America, he says. Quote, the people of Greenland would like to be a part [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=662.16s)]
*  of the United States. He even trotted out his family to make this case as well as if it was true. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=667.92s)]
*  Did the people there that you spoke with and interacted with, did they seem interested in [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=676.4s)]
*  the idea of getting closer to the United States and maybe being liberated from Denmark who's had [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=681.8399999999999s)]
*  control of Greenland for the last 200 years? 100 percent. I mean, honestly, I don't, I didn't see [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=689.12s)]
*  a single negative. 100 percent, 100. They want to join the United States. Oh yeah, they want to be [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=696.88s)]
*  liberated. They want to join the United States. 100 percent. New polling in Greenland by a local [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=705.68s)]
*  polling firm today finds that shockingly it's actually not 100 percent. It's 6 percent. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeE-1LrWTI&t=710.56s)]
