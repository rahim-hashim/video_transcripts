# 'Lies Lead To Violence': Snyder On The Big Lie's Toxic Cycle
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ)
*  When you talk about the big lie, the lies about the election being perpetrated—excuse [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=0.0s)]
*  me, perpetuated, for all of those reasons that you described, the one that sticks to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=5.28s)]
*  me sort of viscerally is that it serves to provide a justification for revenge on Trump's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=10.92s)]
*  behalf, that to the extent that they keep propagating this idea that the election was [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=18.92s)]
*  not just a fraud or not just a shonda, but it was stolen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=23.6s)]
*  It was stolen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=29.8s)]
*  Well, the victim of that theft is Trump, and as you say, it creates the justification for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=30.8s)]
*  revenge on his part. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  Today, you wrote about the expectation that his followers will want to see him not necessarily [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=36.72s)]
*  elected president, but installed as president, with or without any fig leaf of democratic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=42.0s)]
*  process, in order to sort of effectuate that revenge. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=47.84s)]
*  That's a very chilling prospect. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=52.12s)]
*  I wondered if you could sort of explain that a little bit in terms of why you think that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=53.76s)]
*  risk is real. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=57.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=59.12s)]
*  I mean, let me first just spell out the thought that you had, which I very much agree with. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=59.64s)]
*  We know a couple of things from the history of authoritarianism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  One is that lies lead to violence, and then violence leads to more lies. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=67.24s)]
*  We're caught in that cycle now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=71.64s)]
*  Once Mr. Trump told the big lie, it was pretty much inevitable that violence would have to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=73.44s)]
*  happen to make it seem true. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=76.84s)]
*  And now that that violence has taken place, people have to lie about it in turn, so they're [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=78.72s)]
*  that's a downward spiral. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Another thing we know from the history of the big lie is that it's about just what you [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  said. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=86.92s)]
*  The big lie is about flipping the victim and the perpetrator. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=87.92s)]
*  It's about turning the perpetrator into the victim. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=91.12s)]
*  In fact, it was Mr. Trump who conspired to overturn our democratic procedures, but the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=93.56s)]
*  big lie allows him to flip victimhood and demand revenge, in effect, for something that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  he did himself. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=101.76s)]
*  As for the installation of Mr. Trump, I think that is now the dominant scenario. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  I think that's what people are really thinking about. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=107.72s)]
*  The voter suppression is meant to keep things as close as possible. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=110.36s)]
*  The laws which allow voter subversion, audits to run out the clock, state legislatures allocating [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=114.27999999999999s)]
*  electors by themselves, Republicans in the House of Representatives then voting in, effectively [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=119.72s)]
*  installing a president who's lost. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=125.52s)]
*  That is right now, unfortunately, the mainstream scenario. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=128.0s)]
*  And if it happens, I'm afraid it will be welcomed by everyone who's telling the big lie, because [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=132.16s)]
*  the ultimate purpose of the big lie is to create this alternative reality that you live [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=137.28s)]
*  in up to the moment when you take power again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  And then you imagine that when you take power, that your guy who's taken power will make [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=144.0s)]
*  it all true, will correct the past, will sort everything out for you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=148.28s)]
*  That's the dream. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  I think it could work to get him close to the Oval Office. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  I think what Republicans who think this way are not taking into account is that it's unlikely [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=158.64s)]
*  to work as a way to make him a legitimate president, because these methods of getting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=163.0s)]
*  somebody into the Oval Office will be unacceptable to large swaths of the American public and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=167.48s)]
*  to many American institutions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=172.0s)]
*  Right, which says one thing about whether he'll be viewed as a legitimate president. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  It says something else entirely about whether or not we continue to exist as a coherent [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=178.72s)]
*  country under those circumstances. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFoZSbh6MQ&t=183.76s)]
