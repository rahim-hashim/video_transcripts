# Jury hears closing arguments, begins deliberations in Carroll lawsuit against Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA)
*  This afternoon, writer and journalist E. Jean Carroll today left the Manhattan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=0.0s)]
*  federal courthouse to applause and cheers. After closing arguments in her [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=4.32s)]
*  civil lawsuit against the former president, Ms. Carroll says Trump raped [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=8.76s)]
*  her in New York City in the mid-90s. She says he then defamed her by calling her [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=11.84s)]
*  accusation a hoax and a lie. During this two-week civil trial, E. Jean Carroll [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=16.56s)]
*  testified on her own behalf. She said at the outset, simply quote, I'm here because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=22.52s)]
*  Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it he said it didn't happen. He [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=27.32s)]
*  lied and shattered my reputation and I'm here to try and get my life back. In the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=31.44s)]
*  end, Trump himself chose not to take the witness stand to rebut her. Despite [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=37.92s)]
*  telling reporters in Ireland last week that he would come to New York to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=42.28s)]
*  confront her in the courtroom, he did no such thing. That means the only Trump [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=45.32s)]
*  appearance the jury will have seen throughout this entire trial is the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  video from his deposition in the case, which lawyers for Ms. Carroll played [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=53.06s)]
*  during closing arguments today. At one point in the questioning, the former [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=57.38s)]
*  president mistook a photo of E. Jean Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  Despite the fact that Trump has staked his effective defense in this case on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=67.98s)]
*  the idea that E. Jean Carroll was not his type, not his type but he thought she [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=72.54s)]
*  looked enough like his ex-wife that he mistook the two of them in a photo. One [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=77.74s)]
*  attorney for Ms. Carroll told the jury today, quote, he knows what he did. He [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=83.14s)]
*  knows that he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll. Again, closing arguments wrapped [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  today. The case will now go to the jury. They'll begin their deliberations [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  tomorrow morning. Joining us now is my friend Lisa Rubin, MSNBC legal analyst, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=94.78s)]
*  longtime colleague on this show. She's been covering the E. Jean Carroll civil [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  suit. Lisa, thank you for being here. It's nice to see you under the lights [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=103.46s)]
*  instead of just in the office. It's weird but good. Yeah, it's weird but [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=106.78s)]
*  wonderful. What exactly is the jury going to decide tomorrow? They're going [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=110.34s)]
*  to be instructed by the judge. It's a civil case. That's right. They're being [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=115.78s)]
*  asked not to find guilt or innocence but rather liability or lack of liability. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  That's correct. And they're also going to be asked to find if Donald Trump is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=123.7s)]
*  liable, to what amount of damages he's liable to E. Jean Carroll for [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  compensating her for her losses and also punitive damages. Did he do something [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  so egregious here that it's worth going above and beyond what she lost to send [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=137.89999999999998s)]
*  a message to him and to others who might be thinking about this kind of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  behavior? Bottom line in the cold sort of light of day, what's at stake here [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=146.54s)]
*  for Trump is a finding by a jury of liability and some money. In terms of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=150.42s)]
*  the amount of money, I don't know what counts as a meaningful amount of money [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  for Donald Trump. It's very hard for me to understand somebody in his financial [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  circumstances what that would mean. Has there been anything that's happened in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=163.94s)]
*  the course of the trial that's given you a sense of what the potential range [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=166.98s)]
*  might be if indeed he is found liable? Yes and no. So E. Jean Carroll's lawyers [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=169.78s)]
*  presented a damages expert solely on reputational damages. The woman was a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  professor of marketing and social media who said to mount a reputation repair [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=179.33999999999997s)]
*  campaign here would cost somewhere between $350,000 and $2.7 million. But [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=183.62s)]
*  that doesn't include the damage to E. Jean Carroll emotionally. And today in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  their closing, her lawyers talked about the loss of companionship in her life [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  because of her trauma. She has engaged in avoidant behavior. She doesn't flirt. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=200.26s)]
*  She doesn't banter. She sort of closes down emotionally. They compared it to a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=204.26s)]
*  great closing over a bodega that she is not capable of sustaining a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=207.82s)]
*  relationship with a man and therefore they should consider that and awarding [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=212.42s)]
*  damages as well. The way that these cases were closed to the well, it's not [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=217.02s)]
*  the prosecution and the defense, but that's effectively the way it works. I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=222.9s)]
*  felt like there was some suspense really until late in the day yesterday as to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=226.3s)]
*  whether or not there was going to be an additional witness, whether or not Trump [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  was going to turn up. But it seemed clear to you that the case closed today that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  Trump's own attorneys had basically had two plans, one for if he had showed up [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  and one for if he didn't, that they closed in a way that they had to because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=241.78s)]
*  they'd mounted no effective defense. I think they never expected him to come [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=245.22s)]
*  and I actually think they didn't want him to come. Joe Toccappina in his [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=249.78s)]
*  closing today reiterated so many of the same themes we saw from him in the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=253.34s)]
*  opening and one of those themes was we don't have to mount a defense because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=257.54s)]
*  how do you prove a negative? This never happened. He said it never happened. I'm [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=261.54s)]
*  even going to show you excerpts from his video deposition where he says [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=265.3s)]
*  emphatically this never happened and therefore we're not putting on a defense. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=268.5s)]
*  Our sole defense is going to be by cross-examining their witnesses [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=272.42s)]
*  because we can't prove that something that didn't happen didn't happen. So our [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  sole defense is his assertion that it didn't happen regardless of what evidence [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=279.18s)]
*  is provided by the other side. And poking holes in all the evidence provided by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=282.82s)]
*  the other side. Do you think that this was an additionally traumatizing event [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  for Eugene Carroll having been there in the courthouse this week? I mean it's an [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=291.66s)]
*  act of remarkable bravery for her to have brought this case if her accusations [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=295.14s)]
*  are accurate. Was this was this case just as much as painful as it seemed from the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=298.9s)]
*  outside? I mean look I'm not a psychologist right and I don't have any [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=305.14s)]
*  degrees that would allow me to say whether somebody is malingering or [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=309.3s)]
*  telling the truth but I believed that her story was true for her. The emotion [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=311.62s)]
*  and the intensity that she experienced all throughout the trial including [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=316.42s)]
*  from the very openings when she turned around and looked at Tacapeena directly [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=320.3s)]
*  in the face as if to say to him how dare you say this about me while I'm sitting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=323.7s)]
*  in this courtroom was profoundly affecting and to see her breakdown even [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=327.86s)]
*  today after closings were over hug her lawyer Robbie Kaplan in a very emotional [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  moment between the two of them. I think Eugene Carroll was partially [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=336.62s)]
*  retraumatized by experiencing this and yet she said she was so happy that she [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=341.26s)]
*  finally got to have her day in court and I believe that too. She got to say her [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=345.74s)]
*  peace. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_y556r8rA&t=348.74s)]
