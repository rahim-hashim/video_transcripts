**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE)
*  We are still monitoring this developing situation at a nuclear power plant in eastern Ukraine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=0.0s)]
*  after it was reportedly shelled by Russian forces. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=5.2s)]
*  We have a new statement out from Ukraine's emergency services. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=8.52s)]
*  They actually say that the fire broke out in a training building outside the plant's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=12.4s)]
*  perimeter. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  It says the fireproof condition at the nuclear power plant is OK. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  I also just want to tell our viewers a really quick update that we just got out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=24.04s)]
*  We got another readout from the White House on the situation at the nuclear power plant. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=27.68s)]
*  This is the latest that we're getting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=31.48s)]
*  According to U.S. officials, our latest information shows no indications of elevated levels of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=33.32s)]
*  radiation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=39.32s)]
*  We are monitoring the situation closely. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=40.76s)]
*  Again, the U.S., which probably has some real-time intelligence and eyes on the situation there, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=43.2s)]
*  is saying they have no indication of elevated levels of radiation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twUop1wHxFE&t=48.32s)]
