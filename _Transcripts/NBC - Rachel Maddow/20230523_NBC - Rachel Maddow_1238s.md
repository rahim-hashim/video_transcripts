# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 22
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY)
*  E. Jean Carroll and Robbie Kaplan were here live on the show last week in the immediate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=0.0s)]
*  wake of that remarkable court ruling in which a jury held unanimously that former President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=5.76s)]
*  Donald Trump had sexually abused E. Jean Carroll and that when he denied that and disparaged [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  her and called her a liar, he was the one who was lying. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=20.6s)]
*  And he was defaming Ms. Carroll, and he was going to have to pay for it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=25.14s)]
*  In that case, that jury ordered Donald Trump to pay E. Jean Carroll $5 million in damages, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=29.56s)]
*  both for what he did and for what he said about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=37.44s)]
*  But if you watched the show last week and you saw that interview that I did with E. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=41.76s)]
*  Jean Carroll and with her attorney, you might remember that, you know, in addition to sort [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=45.4s)]
*  of reflecting on the fact that they had won that case, one of the things they were newly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=51.36s)]
*  contending with in the wake of that jury verdict was that even though Trump had just been ordered [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  to pay out millions of dollars because of his attacks on E. Jean Carroll because of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=63.46s)]
*  his lies about her, even though he had just been ordered to pay millions of dollars, literally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=68.12s)]
*  within a day of that jury verdict and being ordered to pay all that money, he was out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=74.78s)]
*  there saying all the same things again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=80.06s)]
*  You did force accountability, and then he did it again. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=85.7s)]
*  The defamation, the calling you a liar, the exact same things the jury held him liable [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=89.06s)]
*  for the day before. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=93.7s)]
*  He did again the next day on national television. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=94.7s)]
*  Is that just the way it has to be? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=97.72s)]
*  Do you think that potentially could be actionable if you were to file another suit? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=99.06s)]
*  Would it work the same way? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=103.28s)]
*  So it's definitely actionable. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=104.72s)]
*  He's not going to get away with it another time. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  It's unprecedented for a person to have been held liable in defamation to keep doing the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=110.78s)]
*  defamation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=116.54s)]
*  So there are not a lot of cases that we can look to for a playbook about how to do it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=118.06s)]
*  But suffice to say, I have a lot of lawyers who are very busy looking into this, and we [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=122.18s)]
*  are weighing all of our options. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=126.5s)]
*  Now tonight, here we go. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=128.38s)]
*  The New York Times was first to report E. Jean Carroll seeks new damages from Trump [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=130.74s)]
*  for comments on CNN, for comments that he made anew about E. Jean Carroll on CNN the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=136.74s)]
*  night after the jury verdict in her case against him. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  Now this is not a new lawsuit against Trump filed by E. Jean Carroll. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  It's effectively an addendum to the existing litigation they've already been in with Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=151.34s)]
*  This new filing today is with the same judge who presided in the trial in which E. Jean [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=156.8s)]
*  Carroll was just awarded five million dollars in damages from Trump. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=162.58s)]
*  This newly amended complaint filed tonight by lawyer Roberta Kaplan and her firm, it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=166.58s)]
*  documents all the new statements that Trump made attacking E. Jean Carroll online and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=173.3s)]
*  on CNN's bizarre town hall event with him the night after the initial jury verdict. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=178.74s)]
*  It then runs through some of the threats that E. Jean Carroll received from Trump supporters [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  after Trump went on the attack against her again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=189.22s)]
*  And the complaint then says this, and I'm not a lawyer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=192.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm just I have only a layman's understanding of these things. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  But I feel like this complaint is written in such a way that I sort of get how it is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=199.14s)]
*  that they are attaching this new complaint to the existing litigation they're already [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=203.5s)]
*  in with him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=208.17999999999998s)]
*  It says, quote, At the jury trial that took place in the related action between April [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  25th and May 9th, this court instructed the jury concerning an award of punitive damages [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  in connection with Trump's previous defamatory statement in 2022. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  This court instructed the jury as follows, quote, punitive damages may be awarded to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  punish a defendant who's acted maliciously and to discourage others from doing the same. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  A statement is made with malice or it is made maliciously if it is made with deliberate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  intent to injure or made out of hatred or ill will or spite or made with willful or [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=241.26s)]
*  wanton or reckless disregard of another's rights. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=246.94s)]
*  Both prior and subsequent defamations and subsequent statements of the defendant may [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=250.54s)]
*  reflect a defendant's malice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=255.62s)]
*  Trump's defamatory statements post verdict show the depth of his malice toward Carroll. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=258.78s)]
*  So that's how the lawyers phrase it in this complaint. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=264.82s)]
*  But it sort of makes sense. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=267.34s)]
*  In layman's words and other terms, the jury was told that they're supposed to consider [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=268.34s)]
*  the effect of sort of the amount of malice this person had when he made his statements [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=274.9s)]
*  defaming this other person. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=284.38s)]
*  And the jury was instructed that they can judge the amount of malice he had not just [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  by things he said and did before the statements in question, but by things he said and did [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=292.05999999999995s)]
*  after. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=297.1s)]
*  So after the initial statements by him that were at issue in the previous trial, after [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=299.06s)]
*  he defamed E. Jean Carroll, which is what the jury found, you know, they held him liable [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=304.5s)]
*  for it in court. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=311.02s)]
*  After that, he, in fact, went back and made more and worse statements about her. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=312.22s)]
*  And the claim here is that that that matters. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=317.86s)]
*  At least E. Jean Carroll's attorneys are arguing that that should matter in terms of how much [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=319.98s)]
*  he should have to pay because that is something that speaks directly to the amount of malice [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=324.82s)]
*  and the type of malice he had toward her when he made those statements that is relevant [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=330.06s)]
*  to a civil jury deciding what the consequences should be for him of him having made those [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=335.18s)]
*  statements. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=341.46s)]
*  So that's that's basically the argument. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=343.34s)]
*  What's she demanding here? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=345.02s)]
*  What is she asking for? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=346.02s)]
*  Well, here it is for the complaint. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=347.26s)]
*  Prayer for relief. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=349.58s)]
*  Therefore, E. Jean Carroll prays for relief as follows. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=351.54s)]
*  A. Ordering Trump to retract any and all defamatory statements. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  B. Ordering Trump to pay compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  in no event less than ten million dollars. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=364.74s)]
*  C. Ordering Trump to pay punitive damages. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=368.98s)]
*  In addition to compensatory damages, to pay punitive damages in an amount to be determined [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=373.66s)]
*  at trial, and she also wants him to have to pay all the costs, all the court costs on [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=378.4s)]
*  both sides, which of course could be a lot. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=383.84s)]
*  It then closes with a jury demand. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  The last part of her prayer for relief is that she wants all this handled back before [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=388.76s)]
*  a jury. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=393.64s)]
*  So that has happened just tonight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=395.88s)]
*  The complaint spelling out in pretty plain English that according to E. Jean Carroll's [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  lawyers what they want the court to consider is that if Trump's going to keep lying about [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=403.84s)]
*  these sexual assault claims and he's going to keep lying about E. Jean Carroll, then [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=407.88s)]
*  the five million dollars he's already been ordered to pay, that isn't going to be enough. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=411.76s)]
*  There's going to be more. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=417.23999999999995s)]
*  Quote, this conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award in Carroll's favor [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=418.67999999999995s)]
*  both to punish Trump and to deter him from engaging in further defamation and to deter [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=425.08s)]
*  others from doing the same. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=430.26s)]
*  So they want compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=432.98s)]
*  ten million dollars. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=437.86s)]
*  And in addition to that, they want very substantial punitive damages on top of the ten million [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=439.22s)]
*  plus costs. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=445.26s)]
*  And they want it back before the jury. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=447.0s)]
*  This headline from the New York Times reads, quote, prosecutors sought records on Trump's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=450.24s)]
*  foreign business deals since 2017. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=454.38s)]
*  According to two people familiar with the matter, quote, federal prosecutors overseeing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=458.74s)]
*  the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents have issued a subpoena [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=462.14s)]
*  for information about his business dealings in foreign countries after he took office [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=467.62s)]
*  as president. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=473.74s)]
*  Quote, it remains unclear precisely what the prosecutors were hoping to find by sending [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=474.74s)]
*  the subpoena to Mr. Trump's company. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=479.86s)]
*  But the subpoena suggests investigators have cast a wider net than previously understood [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=482.82s)]
*  he broke the law and taking sensitive government materials with him upon leaving the White [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=489.26s)]
*  House and then not fully complying with demands for their return. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  When disparate breaking news stories like that break within moments of each other right [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=499.06s)]
*  before we get in the air, we call Barb McQuait, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=503.42s)]
*  of Michigan, co-host of the Sisters in Law podcast. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=508.3s)]
*  Barb, it's really great to see you. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  Thanks very much for joining us on sort of short notice tonight. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=513.26s)]
*  You bet. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=516.06s)]
*  Glad to be with you, Rachel. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=517.06s)]
*  Let me just ask you if you can explain what you see as significant, if anything, about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=518.38s)]
*  this news of the federal subpoena, prosecutors looking into Trump's possible foreign business [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=524.0999999999999s)]
*  dealings dating back to when he took office in 2017. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=530.16s)]
*  What does that say to you? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=534.78s)]
*  Well, it is both a fairly routine move, but also one with potentially explosive consequences, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=535.78s)]
*  I think, Rachel. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=542.2199999999999s)]
*  You know, whenever you're investigating a white-collar case, you want to follow the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=543.34s)]
*  money, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=546.1800000000001s)]
*  It's what Deep Throat told Woodward and Bernstein to do, because you might find some interesting [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  connections, trails, motives, et cetera. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=551.02s)]
*  But in this case, when prosecutors are deciding whether to file charges for mishandling classified [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=554.28s)]
*  documents, they're looking for aggravating factors like obstruction of justice. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=559.26s)]
*  But another one is disloyalty to the United States. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=563.22s)]
*  So if you can make a link that there was some motive for payments from a foreign government [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=565.7s)]
*  in exchange for perhaps sharing classified documents about those things or trying to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=570.62s)]
*  leverage information to get an upper hand in business negotiations, that could be a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=575.54s)]
*  very powerful aggravating factor that could lead toward charges for mishandling these [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=580.2199999999999s)]
*  classified documents. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=585.3399999999999s)]
*  Now, the target of this subpoena, according to The New York Times' reporting, was Trump's [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=586.8199999999999s)]
*  business. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=592.14s)]
*  And Trump's business has had its own legal story in the past year or two, including being [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=593.14s)]
*  convicted as a business entity on counts related to business and tax fraud. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=599.86s)]
*  How much leeway does the Trump organization, Trump's organization as a business, have [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=606.78s)]
*  in complying with a subpoena like this? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=612.86s)]
*  Is it a black and white case where they have no choice in the matter, or is this the sort [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  of thing where they could either resist it or fight it overtly in court? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=618.62s)]
*  They could fight it, Rachel. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=623.22s)]
*  I mean, ordinarily, when you get a subpoena from the government, the presumption is that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=624.22s)]
*  it is regular and that you will comply with it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=627.62s)]
*  And really, the only basis for objecting is if there is some sort of privilege—I can't [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=630.46s)]
*  really imagine one here—or that it is somehow overly broad. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=634.62s)]
*  If you asked for millions and millions of documents, a company might say that's unreasonable [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=638.34s)]
*  and might go to court to quash it or try to narrow the scope of it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=643.22s)]
*  But ordinarily, if you ask a business for their business records and it's within the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=646.54s)]
*  scope of the investigation, then a judge is going to enforce that subpoena. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=649.78s)]
*  For now, it is the former president who is the far-out front-runner for his party's [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=655.62s)]
*  presidential nomination. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=659.54s)]
*  And while he is going through the bottomlands in terms of his legal troubles in civil court, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=661.62s)]
*  in criminal court, in state court, potentially soon in federal court, whether or not that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=666.48s)]
*  makes the far-right Republican base voters like him even more, him being the standard [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=672.14s)]
*  bearer again for his party, it just isn't good news for his party. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=678.48s)]
*  I mean, yes, Donald Trump was elected in 2016 to the White House—yay for Republicans—but [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=684.74s)]
*  then in the next election after that, in 2018, Republicans lost more than 40 seats in the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=689.58s)]
*  House. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=695.02s)]
*  In the next election after that, their Republican president, Donald Trump, became a one-term [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=696.02s)]
*  president. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  He lost the White House while their party also lost the Senate. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=702.0600000000001s)]
*  Then in the next election after that, a midterm election after the election of a new Democratic [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=704.62s)]
*  president, historically that means the Republicans should have cleaned up. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=709.34s)]
*  This is a midterm election where Republicans were predicting they'd picked up 40, 50, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=713.18s)]
*  maybe even 60 or 70 seats in the House. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=717.42s)]
*  Republicans instead in 2018 ended up with a single-digit win in the House. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=721.2199999999999s)]
*  What happened to the red wave? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  They were so flummoxed by how poorly they did in 2018 that when they finally squeaked [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=730.02s)]
*  over the line to be able to pick a Republican speaker, it took them 15 ballots and five [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=734.7399999999999s)]
*  days to do it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  It was the first time in a century it had taken more than one ballot and it took them [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=741.5s)]
*  15. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=744.82s)]
*  So 2016, yeah, okay, but then 2018, no. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=747.3s)]
*  2020, no. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=750.9s)]
*  2022, no. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=752.7s)]
*  Even this year, 2023, in an off year, the elections last week, Democrats won contested [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=755.58s)]
*  special elections in swing states like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=760.98s)]
*  They won big mayors races away from the Republicans in previously reliably red places like Jacksonville, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=764.62s)]
*  Florida and Colorado Springs, Colorado. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=770.86s)]
*  In Jacksonville, it was a Democrat who won the mayor's race in Colorado Springs. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=773.82s)]
*  It was an independent, but that was the first time ever somebody who is not a Republican [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=776.94s)]
*  has won the mayor's race in Colorado Springs. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=781.38s)]
*  I mean, just looking at how Republicans have done in elections in the era of Donald Trump, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=784.3000000000001s)]
*  having Donald Trump as their standard bearer of their party has been bad for them. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  It has not been good for them as a party. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=796.34s)]
*  And you know, maybe it's not fair to only judge them by what their standard bearer has [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=800.58s)]
*  been able to achieve politically. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=806.02s)]
*  Of course, there's lots of states that are under Republican control. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=807.4200000000001s)]
*  Aside from Donald Trump, how's it going politically in terms of the national political image for [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=810.46s)]
*  the Republican Party when you look at what's going on in states run by Republicans? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=815.58s)]
*  Well, they haven't exactly been cleaning up on big political winning issues just in the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=819.6600000000001s)]
*  current news cycle. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=823.7s)]
*  I mean, this is the headline in the Wall Street Journal today. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=825.6600000000001s)]
*  Arkansas seeks to end school desegregation settlements. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=829.0600000000001s)]
*  Arkansas? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=833.26s)]
*  School desegregation? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=835.38s)]
*  Why does that ring a bell? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=836.46s)]
*  Literally, the state of the Little Rock Nine, the state where federal troops had to be used [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=839.74s)]
*  to desegregate the schools by force years after the Brown versus Board of Education [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=845.1800000000001s)]
*  ruling that said segregation was illegal. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=851.38s)]
*  That state under Republican leadership from Sarah Huckabee Sanders, now that state is [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=855.62s)]
*  deciding that they're going to get rid of desegregation orders for all their schools. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=859.46s)]
*  Because surely that's never been a problem in Arkansas. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=865.4200000000001s)]
*  This comes hot on the heels of Arkansas blazing a trail in Republican governance against child [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=868.1800000000001s)]
*  labor laws as well. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=873.38s)]
*  Because yes, who among us in America has not laid awake at night worrying that the big [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=875.94s)]
*  problems, the big problems we need bold leadership to address in this country are the fact that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=879.74s)]
*  schools can't be segregated anymore. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=885.74s)]
*  And oh boy, do I hate that there are child labor laws. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=888.82s)]
*  Don't worry, Republicans are in control in Arkansas and they're on both those big problems. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  In Indiana, under Republican governance, their new law there on books in schools threatens [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=897.86s)]
*  school librarians with felony convictions. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=904.86s)]
*  Threatens to put librarians in prison if they don't abide by Republicans new book bans. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=909.22s)]
*  The Indianapolis Star recently reported on how Captain America comic books were among [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=917.22s)]
*  the books being banned in Indiana schools now for being somehow offensive to Republicans. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=923.22s)]
*  Apparently after that ended up in the paper, they decided that Captain America had been [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=928.22s)]
*  removed in error and they needed to put him back. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=934.22s)]
*  But that's the kind of level of political sophistication Republicans are playing with in Indiana [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=938.22s)]
*  right now. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=943.22s)]
*  In Florida this weekend, the NAACP had to issue a travel advisory for African Americans, for [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=944.22s)]
*  black travelers, advising that recent changes in Florida law under that state's Republican [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=950.22s)]
*  governor and Republican legislature mean that black travelers need to, quote, beware. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=955.22s)]
*  That, quote, your life is not valued in the state of Florida, essentially saying that if you are [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=960.22s)]
*  a person of color, traveling to Florida should be consented to only at your own risk because [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=966.22s)]
*  that state is against you. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=974.22s)]
*  I mean, whatever your politics are, whether you agree with what these Republican governors and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=979.22s)]
*  Republican legislatures are doing in the state, you still can see, right, that this isn't exactly [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=984.22s)]
*  a thrilling national platform on which Republican candidates are going to be eager to run for the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=991.22s)]
*  White House next year, right? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=997.22s)]
*  Like, jailing librarians, banning abortion, banning books, undoing desegregation orders for [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=999.22s)]
*  schools, getting rid of child labor laws, right? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1009.22s)]
*  I mean, regardless of who their standard bearer is going to be, it's either going to be Donald Trump [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1014.22s)]
*  or it's going to be somebody else who has this record of current models in Republican governance to [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1020.22s)]
*  run on. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1025.22s)]
*  And regardless of, you know, who their standard bearer is going to be, whether it's going to be Trump [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1027.22s)]
*  or not, regardless of the unpopularity and extremity of how they are governing in the states they [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1032.22s)]
*  control. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1038.22s)]
*  I mean, the one hope they have for taking back the White House next year, for taking back control of [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1040.22s)]
*  the executive branch, for taking the presidency in 2024, the one thing that is in their control, the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1044.22s)]
*  one thing they can control about the country as a whole, the political climate for the country, the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1050.22s)]
*  one thing they can do single-handedly is control the economy. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1055.22s)]
*  They can control that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1061.22s)]
*  That is in their hands. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1063.22s)]
*  Democratic President Joe Biden is, of course, running for reelection. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1065.22s)]
*  And, you know, he's running for reelection having brought the U.S. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1069.22s)]
*  unemployment rate down from 6.3 percent when he was sworn in to 3.4 percent today. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1073.22s)]
*  Unemployment rate is lower right now than what we had in the 90s, than what we had in the 80s, than [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1079.22s)]
*  what we had in the 70s. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1085.22s)]
*  The last time unemployment this low was 1969. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1087.22s)]
*  He's created millions and millions and millions of new jobs in his one term as president thus far. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1091.22s)]
*  And that, of course, is terrible for Republicans' political prospects. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1097.22s)]
*  But they can't control anything about Donald Trump, apparently. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1101.22s)]
*  They apparently can't restrain themselves when it comes to governing in a way that might be [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1105.22s)]
*  nationally attractive to swing voters. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1109.22s)]
*  But they really can control the health of the economy with this data. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1111.22s)]
*  In this debt ceiling fight, that is within their control. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1115.22s)]
*  And they know it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaQlITKUgAY&t=1119.22s)]
