# GOP's legislative answer to gun violence: more guns, looser laws
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRS3JEkkQ60)
*  And history, of course, will record that in the same month as these shootings today, as well as the Nashville Elementary School gun massacre two weeks ago, within the same month of those things happening, Republicans in North Carolina overrode the Democratic governor's veto. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRS3JEkkQ60&t=0.0s)]
*  So Republicans in North Carolina overrode the veto from the state's Democratic governor so they could strip gun safety laws in that state, get rid of gun laws in that state. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRS3JEkkQ60&t=19.0s)]
*  So now in North Carolina, you don't need any sort of permit to get a handgun. Just grab and go whenever you get the urge. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRS3JEkkQ60&t=30.0s)]
*  Florida Republicans also just passed a new law that removes all rules around carrying loaded weapons on your person in Florida. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRS3JEkkQ60&t=36.0s)]
*  No permit, no training, no license, no fee. Just grab and go like a bag of chips. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRS3JEkkQ60&t=44.0s)]
