# Mississippi, Alabama still celebrating Confederate general on MLK Day
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME)
*  Obviously, we remember Dr. King now as one of the greatest moral leaders ever produced [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=0.0s)]
*  by our country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=4.82s)]
*  But he really did have the whole power of the state turned against him in his day, which [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  really wasn't all that long ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=12.22s)]
*  Today in every state in the country, we celebrate that federal holiday honoring Dr. King. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=16.62s)]
*  But in two states, in Alabama and Mississippi, today is not just Martin Luther King Day. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=22.16s)]
*  Today in Alabama and Mississippi, it's King Lee Day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=28.94s)]
*  Not King Lee like an adverb, not like he ruled in a King Lee way, but King Dash Lee, as in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=33.02s)]
*  Martin Luther King and Robert E. Lee. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=40.42s)]
*  In Mississippi and Alabama today, in 2023, they have added to Martin Luther King Day [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=43.84s)]
*  another state holiday on the same day, honoring the commander of the Confederate Army that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=50.56s)]
*  fought to preserve slavery. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=57.12s)]
*  And Virginia used to do that too until the year 2000. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=60.68s)]
*  And Arkansas used to do that too. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=64.08s)]
*  They used to do King Lee Day as well until 2018. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=65.8s)]
*  But even if it took them a long time to get there, at least Arkansas and Virginia did [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=69.96s)]
*  finally give it up and stop using the federal Martin Luther King civil rights holiday to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=74.0s)]
*  also honor slavery. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=79.74s)]
*  Mississippi and Alabama are still doing that as of this year, which is amazing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDg4SH-COME&t=82.52s)]
