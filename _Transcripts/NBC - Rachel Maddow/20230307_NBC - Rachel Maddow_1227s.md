# Watch Rachel Maddow highlights: March 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ)
*  What happens when the dear leader and his party decide that if the legal system is going to be used against the dear leader, then the legal system's got to go? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=0.0s)]
*  What happens when you take it further, when you take it beyond criticizing the legal system? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=9.0s)]
*  You take it beyond criticizing those who are investigating you, and you instead decide the system's got to go? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=14.0s)]
*  I mean, we know what this looks like in other countries. What does it look like here? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=23.0s)]
*  Would anyone try that here in the United States in our era, in our time? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, here's tonight. Here's on the front page of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution right now as we speak. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Quote, Republicans demand oversight of prosecutors amid Trump probe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Here's part of the lead from reporter Greg Blustein at the AJC. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Quote, the Georgia House tonight approved a measure to create a new state board that could punish or oust district attorneys. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=51.0s)]
*  The latest step in an ongoing campaign by Republicans to exert oversight over prosecutors they see as skirting their duties. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=58.0s)]
*  The measure passed the House 98 to 75 today over the objections of Democrats and prominent prosecutors, among them Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis, who is leading an ongoing probe of Donald Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Republicans have rallied around the overhaul as a way to rein in, quote, rogue prosecutors. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=77.0s)]
*  Powerful Republicans have put it on the fast track. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=82.0s)]
*  The Georgia Senate has passed a similar version of this legislation, and the overall effort is backed by both Governor Brian Kemp and Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=85.0s)]
*  I should mention Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones in Georgia is one of the people who's been notified by the Fulton County District Attorney's Office [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=96.0s)]
*  that he himself is a target for potential prosecution in the investigation into Trump's efforts to throw out the election results in Georgia and have election results in that state falsely declare him the winner. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=103.0s)]
*  The Lieutenant Governor is facing potential charges himself in that investigation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=114.0s)]
*  He and at least one Republican state senator who's also facing potential charges in that investigation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=119.0s)]
*  Turns out they are strong supporters of this new measure that would give Republicans in the legislature effectively the power to remove prosecutors. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=124.0s)]
*  That they don't like. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Facing criminal charges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=134.0s)]
*  How about you vote yourself the power to fire the person who's going to charge you? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=136.0s)]
*  The former president himself, Donald Trump, as of today, is urging Republicans in Georgia that they must pass this legislation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=145.0s)]
*  So Republicans will have the power to remove prosecutors in the middle of their investigations and in the middle of prosecuting any particular case that Republicans might not like for any reason. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=156.0s)]
*  And to be clear, this has now passed the Georgia legislature as of tonight. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=166.0s)]
*  A version of this bill passed the state Senate and the House just passed it tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=173.0s)]
*  And the Republican governor there, Brian Kemp, he says he will sign it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=177.0s)]
*  He is a strong supporter of this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=181.0s)]
*  So they're doing it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=183.0s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe this would be easier to see if it were happening in another country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=185.0s)]
*  And you know, maybe the leader of their party is still going to face criminal charges in other jurisdictions where he is under criminal investigation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Like federally where he's under criminal investigation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=202.0s)]
*  Or in New York State where he's under criminal investigation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=204.0s)]
*  Maybe he will, maybe he won't, none of us know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=206.0s)]
*  But in the one place where he is under criminal investigation and his party is in full control of the state government, they have just decided for the first time in that state's history that it is now, for the first time, within their own power to remove prosecutors in the middle of their duties on their own say so. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=208.0s)]
*  And yes, this is a story about Georgia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=225.0s)]
*  And yes, this is a story about Trump and the potential charges he's facing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=228.0s)]
*  But this is a whole new step for us as a country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=231.0s)]
*  This is a new thing for us as a democracy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=234.0s)]
*  This is not ranting against the investigators. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=238.0s)]
*  We've seen that before. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=241.0s)]
*  And calling people names and even picking off individuals in the law enforcement system to try to turn them into enemies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=242.0s)]
*  As bad as that all is, we have seen all of that before. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=249.0s)]
*  This is not just trying to verbally and politically delegitimize the investigating entities. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=252.0s)]
*  Those are all very bad things to do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=258.0s)]
*  But this is more. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Sticks and stones, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=262.0s)]
*  But this is dismantling the way the legal system works. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=264.0s)]
*  So presumably it can no longer work against him. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=268.0s)]
*  This isn't a resolution denouncing a prosecutor who might bring charges against Donald Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=276.0s)]
*  This is giving Republicans, this is Republicans voting to give themselves the power to remove a prosecutor who acts in a way that they do not like, as she is on the precipice of potentially bringing charges against him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=280.0s)]
*  This passed the Georgia State Legislature tonight. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=293.0s)]
*  It will soon be on its way to the governor. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=296.0s)]
*  For Georgia, yes, but for us as a country, this is a benchmark moment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=299.0s)]
*  This is new. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=303.0s)]
*  For 2023, there is an updated indivisible guide. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=305.0s)]
*  And just like the first one, it is very, very, very nuts and bolts. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=309.0s)]
*  It is practical, actionable advice. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=314.0s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=317.0s)]
*  This was a joint protest held by indivisible members and members of the Working Families Party who live in New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler's district. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=319.0s)]
*  You can see from their signs that what they're protesting here are the very, very unpopular Republican proposals to cut Medicare and cut Social Security. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=328.0s)]
*  And what Mike Lawler's constituents are doing here tracks with the advice from the new indivisible guide, page 13. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=337.0s)]
*  What to do if you have a Republican member of Congress? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=344.0s)]
*  Step one, focus on their unpopular ideas and relentlessly tie them to their least appealing positions or controversies. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=347.0s)]
*  The guide goes on to say you should use every possible opportunity to get your member of Congress on the record on those issues. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=354.0s)]
*  And true to form, just as the indivisible guide predicted, in response to that protest, Congressman Lawler had to go on the record. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=363.0s)]
*  He had to release an on the record statement to a local news outlet saying that he opposes any cuts to Social Security and Medicare. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=372.0s)]
*  There it is in black and white. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=380.0s)]
*  They got him on the record. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=382.0s)]
*  Congressman Lawler now on the record opposing cuts to those programs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=384.0s)]
*  That is a form of progress in trying to save those programs. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=387.0s)]
*  Indivisible has now in March launched a new campaign targeting 18 Republican members of Congress, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=393.0s)]
*  including Mike Lawler, who represent districts that President Biden won in the 2020 election. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=399.0s)]
*  So they are Republican members, but their district voted for Biden. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=404.0s)]
*  The reason those 18 are being targeted by indivisible in this new campaign is because practical as ever, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=408.0s)]
*  indivisible believes that that's the start of the road for Democrats to take back the House in 2024. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=415.0s)]
*  You start with picking off those 18 and you move on from there. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=422.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Ezra Levin, who is co-founder of indivisible, who has joined us from time to time over the past few years to talk about the progress of this group [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=426.0s)]
*  and how this very practical approach to organizing is working in our divided and easily distracted society. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=435.0s)]
*  Ezra, it is nice to see you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=441.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=443.0s)]
*  Great to see you, Rachel. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=445.0s)]
*  Was that an appropriate way to describe the trajectory that this is a there's a new indivisible guide for 2023. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=447.0s)]
*  It's specific to the fact that Republicans are in control of the House and it's about sort of protecting progressive priorities, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=454.0s)]
*  but also trying to orient Democrats toward taking back control of the House as soon as possible. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=461.0s)]
*  Gosh, Rachel, you did such a good job. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=468.0s)]
*  I'm going to struggle to add to it, but I'll try. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=470.0s)]
*  And that is this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=473.0s)]
*  We really have I'm not I'm not try about it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=475.0s)]
*  We have a top level goal. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=477.0s)]
*  I would like to see us retake the House, hold the Senate, hold the presidency, reform the filibuster, codify Roe, pass democracy reform. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=478.0s)]
*  That's my North Star. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=486.0s)]
*  That's the North Star of indivisibles all throughout the country. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=487.0s)]
*  The theory is exactly as you laid out. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=491.0s)]
*  We are not going to take every single one of the 435 House districts in 2024. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=493.0s)]
*  That's not the pathway to victory. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=498.0s)]
*  The pathway to victory is where is the low hanging fruit? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=500.0s)]
*  And it turns out, just as you said, there are 18 Republican members of Congress who represent districts that Biden won in 2020. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=503.0s)]
*  So what do you do in those districts? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=511.0s)]
*  How do you take on these folks? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=514.0s)]
*  Now, there's this guy, Mike Lawler, who you just covered. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=515.0s)]
*  I'm going to go out on a limb and say probably 99 percent of people have not heard of Representative Mike Lawler. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=518.0s)]
*  They've heard of Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=524.0s)]
*  They've heard of Matt Gaetz. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=526.0s)]
*  They've heard of Lauren Boerbert. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=527.0s)]
*  Why haven't they heard of Mike Lawler? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=528.0s)]
*  And it's because this guy who represents a Biden won district knows that he's got one path to reelection. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=530.0s)]
*  And that is you've got to raise a whole bunch of money from donors like he was. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=538.0s)]
*  You got to vote more or less the way those donors want you to vote. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=544.0s)]
*  He votes 94 percent of the time with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=547.0s)]
*  And three, this is the tricky part. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=551.0s)]
*  This is the really tricky part. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=553.0s)]
*  You've got to convince your constituents that you're not one of the bad guys in Congress. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=554.0s)]
*  And so that means keeping your constituents in the dark, trying to not say that you vote 94 percent of the time with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=560.0s)]
*  And the good news is sunlight is the best disinfectant and constituents based in that 17th congressional district were able to show up and say, hey, you got to represent us. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Don't side with Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=579.0s)]
*  And in this one instance, we were able to help limit the harm from this member of Congress. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=581.0s)]
*  Now, we are going to try to do that in every single one of these 18 districts. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=586.0s)]
*  Sometimes we're going to get them to go on the record. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=590.0s)]
*  Sometimes they're going to vote against us. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=592.0s)]
*  And so it's going to depend on constituents in those districts to hold them accountable and make sure there is a political price to pay for their extremism. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=594.0s)]
*  Ezra, over the past six years that you've been involved in this this organizing effort, which, again, started small and turned into this big thing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=603.0s)]
*  Do you feel like there are big lessons learned in terms of what works, what's effective, what you might have thought from the outset will work that doesn't or things that you've steered more toward because they have had multiplicative effects? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=612.0s)]
*  They've been more effective than you thought. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=624.0s)]
*  You know, one thing that we always say is pictures are didn't happen. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=626.0s)]
*  You can call your on representative, one of these 18, and they are going to have a staffer take down your message and say, oh, we are really concerned with what you have to say. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=629.0s)]
*  But if that doesn't go anywhere, then there will be no accountability. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=639.0s)]
*  So seeing what these constituents actually did in the districts to get local attention, they got local press coverage of their event. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=643.0s)]
*  They got him on the record. That's what moved him. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=652.0s)]
*  So as much as possible, I do think it is important to lean into public pressure. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=654.0s)]
*  That's what a member of Congress running in the district really cares about. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=660.0s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why if you go to indivisible.org, you can check out the resources we've got. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=664.0s)]
*  If you're in district, you can connect with other local groups who are doing this work and do the work in real time. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=668.0s)]
*  If you're out of district, we are working to connect folks out of district to support real constituents in those districts. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=674.0s)]
*  So I hope everybody knows that it doesn't mean you've got to be in the district to be supportive of this effort. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=681.0s)]
*  We think everybody has a role to play. And that's what we're trying to do. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=687.0s)]
*  We're trying to empower everybody to make sure Congress is truly representative. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=692.0s)]
*  As relevant co-founder of indivisible, as always, doing some of the most practical, strategically interesting organizing in the country. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=696.0s)]
*  Thanks for being with us again. It's nice to see you. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=704.0s)]
*  Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=706.0s)]
*  In 1970, a 22 year old woman named Judy Heumann, H-E-U-M-A-N-N, Heumann, she applied for a license to teach school in New York City. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=708.0s)]
*  She passed the written exam to get a teacher license. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=719.0s)]
*  She passed the oral exam to get a teacher license. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=722.0s)]
*  But the Board of Education nevertheless turned her down, specifically because she used a wheelchair. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=725.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann had got polio when she was 18 months old. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=732.0s)]
*  She'd had to spend months in an iron lung. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=736.0s)]
*  She survived polio, but then she also had to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=738.0s)]
*  And because of that, she faced not just challenges, not just difficulties. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=742.0s)]
*  She faced discrimination because of it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=747.0s)]
*  When she was five years old, her mom tried to sign out for kindergarten and the principal turned her down and said, Judy was a, quote, fire hazard. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=750.0s)]
*  And she would therefore not be allowed to enroll in school. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=759.0s)]
*  It was basically the same excuse she got from the Board of Education as an adult when she tried to become a teacher. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=763.0s)]
*  But in 1970, when they told her, no, you're otherwise qualified, but because you use a wheelchair, you cannot be a teacher. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=770.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann sued the Board of Education in New York and she won. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=777.0s)]
*  She became the first New York teacher ever who was a wheelchair user. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=782.0s)]
*  And that court fight was the first disability civil rights case ever brought in federal court. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=786.0s)]
*  First disability civil rights case ever brought. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=791.0s)]
*  And she won it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=794.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann knew how to fight and she knew what it took to win even the most difficult fights. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=796.0s)]
*  And she did it over and over and over again. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=804.0s)]
*  In 1973, Richard Nixon had signed a law that said that any organization that got federal funding couldn't discriminate against disabled people. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=807.0s)]
*  And so that meant schools at all levels. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=817.0s)]
*  That meant hospitals. That meant the government itself. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=821.0s)]
*  You can't discriminate against disabled people. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=823.0s)]
*  You have to make accommodations so people with disabilities can use those facilities, can use those agencies, can get into those buildings and so on. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=825.0s)]
*  Now, that law was signed in 1973. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=836.0s)]
*  But then when it came to enforcing that law, there needed to be regulations signed and regulations put in place. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=839.0s)]
*  And when it came to enforcing that law and having those regulations, hospitals and schools complained about having to put in ramps or accessible bathrooms. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=845.0s)]
*  And so disabled activists realized this law was in the books, but the regulations implementing the law were not in the books. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=854.0s)]
*  And it was time for the government to actually do what they said they were going to do, to actually do what the law required them to do, to actually implement this piece of civil rights legislation. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=863.0s)]
*  And Judy Heumann, among them, they started demonstrating at federal buildings all across the country. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=874.0s)]
*  And they organized demonstrations at the federal agency responsible for these regulations in Washington. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=881.0s)]
*  And they organized them at the regional offices for this federal agency all over the country. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=889.0s)]
*  The protest organized by Judy Heumann was in San Francisco. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=894.0s)]
*  And that actually ended up being the biggest and longest peaceful occupation of a U.S. federal building in U.S. history. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=897.0s)]
*  More than 100 disabled activists stayed there for four weeks straight. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=904.0s)]
*  They didn't have hot water. They didn't have beds. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=910.0s)]
*  Many of them didn't have access to medicine they needed. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=912.0s)]
*  Week after week, they stayed demanding to be heard, demanding that these regulations go into a place to implement the civil rights legislation. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=915.0s)]
*  Until finally the leaders of the agency agreed to meet with them. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=924.0s)]
*  And in that meeting, Judy Heumann raised a signal point from another movement in American history. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=927.0s)]
*  I can tell you that every time you raise issues of separico, the outrage of disabled individuals across this country is going to continue. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=936.0s)]
*  It is going to be ignited. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=953.0s)]
*  There will be more takeovers of buildings until finally maybe you begin to understand our position. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=954.0s)]
*  We will no longer allow the government to oppress disabled individuals. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=962.0s)]
*  We want the law enforced. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=969.0s)]
*  We want no more segregation. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=971.0s)]
*  We will accept no more discussion of segregation. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=975.0s)]
*  And I would appreciate it if you would stop shaking your head in agreement when I don't think you understand what we are talking about. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=979.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann taught the world what she and her fellow activists were talking about. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=993.0s)]
*  Their willingness to show up and stay there. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=998.0s)]
*  It worked. I said she knew how to win fights. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1002.0s)]
*  She knew how to win big, difficult to win fights. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  That fight in 1977 won this country's first real protections for people with disabilities. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  And it laid the groundwork for civil rights legislation to come. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  In 1990, Judy Heumann was instrumental in getting the Americans with Disabilities Act passed and signed into law. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1019.0s)]
*  The Rehabilitation Act that Nixon had signed back in 73, that was about schools and hospitals and the government itself. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  The ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, also extended those same civil rights protections to private entities, to anybody who had a sort of public accommodation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  People with disabilities need to be able to access the things that other citizens can access and reasonable accommodation for their needs so they can do so is a matter of civil rights. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann then served in government herself, ultimately in both the Clinton administration and in the Obama administration. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  This is from the head of the American Association of People with Disabilities. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann really helped people accept who they were as disabled people and take pride in that identity. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  She helped so many people understand their own power as disabled people. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  More simply, as Judy Heumann put it in her own memoir, some people say that what I did changed the world. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  But really, I simply refused to accept what I was told about who I could be. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1081.0s)]
*  And she says, quote, I was willing to make a fuss about it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  I was willing to make a fuss about it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  Words to live by. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  Because Judy Heumann was willing to make that fuss. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  Life not just here, but in so many countries is better for everyone, even for the people who she beat in all of those fights. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  It is one thing to fight for yourself. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  It is another thing to fight for yourself in a way that leaves your country and the world better off, not only for you and for people like you who come after you, but literally for the people who you fought, who you won the argument against. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1106.0s)]
*  And who you prevailed over in the fight for civil rights. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann is often called the mother of the disability rights movement. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  She died this weekend at the age of 75. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1125.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann, dead at the age of 75. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1129.0s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1133.0s)]
*  After years of residents calling for the renaming of one of South Florida's most well-known roads, the Dixie Highway in 2021 finally became the Harriet Tubman Highway instead. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1135.0s)]
*  Well, as of today, you can take the Harriet Tubman Highway to get to another newly named major road in Miami-Dade County. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  You can take it to Justice Katov's Highway. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court Justice today made her first appearance back in her home state since getting sworn into the court. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1160.0s)]
*  I hope that this street naming will also serve as a testament to what is possible in this great country. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  That's today in Miami-Dade County, in Florida. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  I hope that this street naming will also serve as a testament to what is possible in this great country. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1174.0s)]
*  That's today in Miami-Dade County, in Florida. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5HKRX5e8lQ&t=1204.0s)]
