# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 8
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4)
*  This afternoon writer and journalist E. Jean Carroll today left the Manhattan Federal Courthouse to applause and cheers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=0.0s)]
*  After closing arguments in her civil lawsuit against the former president. Miss Carroll says Trump raped her in New York City in the mid-90s [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=7.44s)]
*  She says he then defamed her by calling her accusation a hoax and a lie [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=13.96s)]
*  During this two-week civil trial E. Jean Carroll testified on her own behalf [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=19.8s)]
*  She said at the outset simply quote [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=24.28s)]
*  I'm here because Donald Trump raped me and when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=26.28s)]
*  He lied and shattered my reputation and I'm here to try and get my life back [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=31.12s)]
*  in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=36.44s)]
*  The end Trump himself chose not to take the witness stand to rebut her [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=37.52s)]
*  Despite telling reporters in Ireland last week that he would come to New York to confront her in the courtroom [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=41.92s)]
*  He did no such thing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=46.88s)]
*  That means the only Trump appearance the jury will have seen throughout this entire trial is the video from his deposition in the case [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=48.2s)]
*  Which lawyers for miss Carroll played during closing arguments today? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=54.959999999999994s)]
*  At one point in the questioning the former president mistook a photo of E. Jean Carroll for his ex-wife [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=60.12s)]
*  Marla Maples [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=67.24s)]
*  Despite the fact that Trump has staked his effective defense in this case on the idea that E. Jean Carroll was not his type [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Not his type, but he thought she looked enough like his ex-wife that he best took the two of them in a photo [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=76.12s)]
*  One attorney from his carol told the jury today quote. He knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=82.68s)]
*  Again closing arguments wrapped today. The case will now go to the jury. They'll begin their deliberations tomorrow morning joining us [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Now is my friend Lisa Rubin MSNBC legal analyst longtime colleague on this show. She's been covering the E. Jean Carroll civil suit [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=96.64000000000001s)]
*  Lisa thank you for being here. It's nice to see you under the lights instead of just in the office [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  It's weird, but good. Yeah, it's weird, but wonderful [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=108.28s)]
*  What exactly is the jury going to decide tomorrow? They're going to be instructed by the judge [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=110.56s)]
*  It's a civil case. They're being asked not to find guilt or innocence, but rather liability or lack of liability [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=116.28s)]
*  That's correct [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  And they're also going to be asked to find if Donald Trump is liable to what amount of damages he is liable to E. Jean Carroll for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Compensating her for her losses and also punitive damages [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=131.6s)]
*  Did he do something so egregious here that it's worth going above and beyond what she lost to send a message to him? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=135.6s)]
*  And to others who might be thinking about this kind of behavior [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Bottom line in the cold sort of light of day what's at stake here for Trump is a finding by a jury of liability and some money [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  In terms of the amount of money, I don't know what counts as a meaningful amount of money for Donald Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=154.04s)]
*  It's very hard for me to understand somebody in his financial circumstances what that would mean [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=159.64s)]
*  Has there been anything that's happened in the course of the trial that's given you a sense of what the potential range might be if indeed he is found liable? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=163.64s)]
*  Yes and no so E. Jean Carroll's lawyers presented at damages experts solely on reputational damages [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=170.64s)]
*  The woman was a professor of marketing and social media who said to mount a reputation repair campaign here would cost somewhere between 350,000 and 2.7 million dollars [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  But that doesn't include the damage to E. Jean Carroll emotionally and today in their closing her lawyers talked about the loss of companionship in her life because of her trauma she has engaged in avoidant behavior [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=189.4s)]
*  She doesn't flirt she doesn't banter she sort of closes down emotionally they compared it to a great closing over a bodega that she is not capable of sustaining a relationship with a man [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=203.4s)]
*  And therefore they should consider that in awarding damages as well [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=214.4s)]
*  The way that these cases were closed today, well it's not the prosecution and the defense but that's effectively the way it works [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=218.4s)]
*  I felt like there was some suspense really until late in the day yesterday as to whether or not there was going to be an additional witness [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=225.4s)]
*  Whether or not Trump was going to turn up but it seemed clear to you that the case closed today that Trump's own attorneys basically had two plans [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=232.4s)]
*  One for if he had showed up and one for if he didn't that they closed in a way that they had to because they'd mounted no effective defense [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=240.4s)]
*  I think they never expected him to come and I actually think they didn't want him to come [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=247.4s)]
*  Joe Tocopina in his closing today reiterated so many of the same themes we saw from him in the opening [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=252.4s)]
*  And one of those themes was we don't have to mount a defense because how do you prove a negative? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=258.4s)]
*  He said it never happened, he said it never happened, I'm even going to show you excerpts from his video deposition where he says emphatically [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=263.4s)]
*  This never happened and therefore we're not putting on a defense, our sole defense is going to be by cross-examining their witnesses [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=269.4s)]
*  Because we can't prove that something that didn't happen didn't happen [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=275.4s)]
*  So our sole defense is his assertion that it didn't happen regardless of what evidence is provided by the other side [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=278.4s)]
*  And poking holes in all the evidence provided by the other side [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=283.4s)]
*  Do you think that this was an additionally traumatizing event for E. Jean Carroll having been there in the courthouse this week? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=287.4s)]
*  I mean it's an act of remarkable bravery for her to have brought this case if her accusations are accurate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=294.4s)]
*  Was this case just as painful as it seemed from the outside? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=299.4s)]
*  I mean look I'm not a psychologist right and I don't have any degrees that would allow me to say whether somebody is malingering or telling the truth [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=305.4s)]
*  But I believed that her story was true for her, the emotion and the intensity that she experienced all throughout the trial [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=312.4s)]
*  Including from the very openings when she turned around and looked at Chakrapina directly in the face as if to say to him [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=319.4s)]
*  How dare you say this about me while I'm sitting in this courtroom? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=325.4s)]
*  Was profoundly affecting and to see her break down even today after closings were over hug her lawyer Robbie Kaplan in a very emotional moment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=328.4s)]
*  Between the two of them I think E. Jean Carroll was partially re-traumatized by experiencing this and yet she said she was so happy that she finally got to have her day in court [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=336.4s)]
*  And I believe that too [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=343.4s)]
*  She got to say her piece [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=347.4s)]
*  Tonight NBC News is verifying some of what are basically the worst fears about the apparent motivation behind the gun massacre that happened this weekend in Allen, Texas [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=349.4s)]
*  And there's so much that is disgusting and unsettling about these latest killings including sort of what they connect to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=363.4s)]
*  You might remember it was a year ago this week that a gunman motivated by white supremacist racist ideology went to Buffalo [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=372.4s)]
*  Went into a supermarket in a black neighborhood in Buffalo and killed 10 African Americans in that market [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=381.4s)]
*  That was a year ago this week [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=387.4s)]
*  That killer claimed he did that he massacred all those people in that supermarket [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=389.4s)]
*  He said he did it because of the great replacement theory which you can hear all about on the Fox News channel [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=395.4s)]
*  He said he did it because of the great replacement theory and because of white genocide which you can hear all about on right wing talk radio [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=400.4s)]
*  He killed 10 people and injured even more people than that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=407.4s)]
*  He got in February this year he was sentenced to 11 life sentences [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=411.4s)]
*  That Buffalo attack again was a year ago this week [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=416.4s)]
*  Also the connection to Allen, Texas [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=421.4s)]
*  Allen, Texas is where this latest massacre was this weekend [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=424.4s)]
*  Allen, Texas is also where the shooter was living from the El Paso massacre [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=427.4s)]
*  Allen, Texas is where the guy started his road trip to that Walmart in El Paso in 2019 where he shot and killed 23 people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=432.4s)]
*  Almost all of whom were Latino [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=441.4s)]
*  Again the killer there ranting that he did it because of the great replacement theory popularized on the Fox News channel in primetime [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=443.4s)]
*  Well now today in Allen, Texas we're learning more about the apparent motive in killing all these people this weekend [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=451.4s)]
*  It is not a subtle thing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=460.4s)]
*  The gunman is believed to have recently posted this photo online [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=465.4s)]
*  This picture and others like it appear to be him [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=470.4s)]
*  Appear to be pictures of himself from a couple of weeks ago [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=473.4s)]
*  You see some of his nice fresh tattoos there [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=476.4s)]
*  NBC also reports that he had a long social media record online that included rants against Jews against women against racial minorities [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=480.4s)]
*  NBC News also reporting that he posted a bunch of stuff online from white supremacist influencers [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=490.4s)]
*  Including the one who recently was apparently invited to Mar-a-Lago to dine with the former president at his South Florida home [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=497.4s)]
*  There have also been reports that the gunman from Allen, Texas this weekend [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=505.4s)]
*  He had a patch that was Velcroed onto the tactical vest he was wearing while he carried out the shooting [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=510.4s)]
*  A patch that had the initials RWDS on it looks like this one [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=515.4s)]
*  There's a patch of a similar kind shown on the tactical vest of the man who is the leader of the Proud Boys [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=521.4s)]
*  Pro-Trump right-wing paramilitary group until not that long ago that Proud Boys leader had a merch store that sold this patch [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=528.4s)]
*  RWDS stands for right-wing death squad [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=536.4s)]
*  Four leaders of the Proud Boys, the pro-Trump paramilitary group were of course convicted of seditious conspiracy at the end of last week [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=540.4s)]
*  For their roles in the January 6th attack on Congress [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=550.4s)]
*  One of those Proud Boys defendants who was just convicted of sedition [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=554.4s)]
*  He had not just a patch of the right-wing death squad acronym like the Allen, Texas shooter had [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=558.4s)]
*  He actually had RWDS right-wing death squad tattooed on his arm which you can see here [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=564.4s)]
*  Today also in federal court in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=571.4s)]
*  We got a fairly heavy sentence handed down against yet another participant in the January 6th attack [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=575.4s)]
*  He's 41 years old. He's a former petty officer first class in the U.S. Navy [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=582.4s)]
*  Disturbingly, he reportedly carried top secret and compartmented information security clearances [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=586.4s)]
*  He was already convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison on charges related to him [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=592.4s)]
*  Possessing illegal weapons, unregistered silencers [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=598.4s)]
*  That was just a few months ago [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=602.4s)]
*  Today he got an additional four years on his sentence for his participation in the January 6th attack [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=603.4s)]
*  And in the FBI affidavit that prosecutors submitted to the court in support of their case [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=609.4s)]
*  That affidavit spells out his communications with FBI confidential informants, his coworkers and others [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=614.4s)]
*  Him spelling out and explaining to people why he was at the Capitol on January 6th [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=623.4s)]
*  With, he says, the Proud Boys [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=628.4s)]
*  That affidavit also explains this man's very clear worldview for what exactly he was doing there that day [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=630.4s)]
*  What he thought he was there to accomplish [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=637.4s)]
*  From that FBI affidavit [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=639.4s)]
*  The vote operated by the Jews [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=653.4s)]
*  Mr. Speed was willing to act corruptly to achieve his goal and stop the certification [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=656.4s)]
*  In part because he felt so passionately that he needed to defend himself and the United States against the country's Jews [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=661.4s)]
*  He did not want the person he saw as a puppet of the Jews to take power [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=668.4s)]
*  Mr. Speed also thought that more violence was needed on January 6th to pressure Congress to stop the certification [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=673.4s)]
*  But that violence did not materialize because Jews had lulled Americans into support for nonviolence [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=680.4s)]
*  Mr. Speed's deeply held anti-Semitism was a core part of his motive on January 6th [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=687.4s)]
*  He told our undercover informant that he believed that America, a Christian country, was locked in a battle with the Jews [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=693.4s)]
*  That's all this week. That's all at once [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=700.4s)]
*  Of course, I didn't even mention, of course, all this is happening while we are in the middle of the trial of the white power great replacement theory [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=704.4s)]
*  Mass murderer from the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=712.4s)]
*  That trial's ongoing right now [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=717.4s)]
*  And of course, all of these things have the same smell, right? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=719.4s)]
*  They're not just, they don't just happen to be connected in the news right now, they're connected [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=722.4s)]
*  The Buffalo white supremacist mass murder, the El Paso white supremacist mass murder, the Pittsburgh synagogue white supremacist mass murder [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=728.4s)]
*  Now it appears the Allen, Texas white supremacist mass murder [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=737.4s)]
*  And in a nation recoiling and ashamed and disgusted [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=741.4s)]
*  There's also these apparent connections, right? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=748.4s)]
*  Between this bleeding, ragged right-wing mass violence [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=752.4s)]
*  And the bleeding, ragged right-wing edge of politics [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=759.4s)]
*  The most mainstream possible electoral Republican politics [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=765.4s)]
*  The most mainstream, most successful right-wing media as well [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=770.4s)]
*  But also this former president and his family and his former officials and the way he is currently running for president again [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=775.4s)]
*  They're inviting literal, Hitler was right, outspoken anti-Semites [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=783.4s)]
*  Putting stars of David, Jewish stars on the heads of their enemies telling people that's who we need to be going after just the way Hitler [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=791.4s)]
*  They're inviting people like that to their events with the highest ranking former officials of their government [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=800.4s)]
*  And it's all happening while that former president is running for president again [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=805.4s)]
*  And it's happening amid this unrelenting wave of white supremacist motivated mass murder [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=809.4s)]
*  Are those two things separate? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=821.4s)]
*  Are those two things just very disturbing parallel tracks that we'll never meet and that have never met? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=823.4s)]
*  Or is one of these things an anchor for the other? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=830.4s)]
*  Does the fact that both of these things are happening at once in our country, frankly, accelerate them both? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=833.4s)]
*  Accelerate the racial radicalism and anti-Semitism as a political tool? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=839.4s)]
*  And also just accelerate the violence in the streets? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=846.4s)]
*  Do they work together? And if so, how? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=850.4s)]
*  And if they do work together, how do we stop it? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=853.4s)]
*  Joining us now is someone who has devoted her professional career to the study of just this problem [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=856.4s)]
*  She is Kathleen Ballou, she's associate professor of history at Northwestern University [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=861.4s)]
*  She's author of the seminal book, Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement, and Paramilitary America [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=865.4s)]
*  Professor Ballou, I really appreciate you making time to be back with us again tonight. Thank you [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=872.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=876.4s)]
*  So you can probably tell from that right through from that wind up that I am disturbed, I'm unnerved at least [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=878.4s)]
*  by these two parallel tracks, by what we see happening with incredible racial and anti-Semitic radicalism [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=889.4s)]
*  adjacent to very mainstream electoral politics and to the kind of mass violence that we are seeing [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=897.4s)]
*  As somebody who's an expert in studies these matters, should we see these things as parallel or are they lines that intersect? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=904.4s)]
*  I don't think we can anymore say that this is adjacent. I think that at least the Republican Party insofar as it is [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=910.4s)]
*  represented by Donald Trump has fully embraced many of these elements. The fact that this kind of speech is not only [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=920.4s)]
*  sort of waved through with a wink and a nod, but invited in, and we can see that in the invitation of people like Nick Fuentes to dinner at Mar-a-Lago [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=931.4s)]
*  the invitation of Holocaust denial into the main sort of welcome of the candidate, and the one that was the most concerning for me [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=941.4s)]
*  as someone who studies this kind of violence was the staging of and the content of the press conference announcing the kickoff of this campaign in Waco, Texas [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=951.4s)]
*  Now, many people know about the Branch Davidians siege in Waco as part of sort of a general anti-government sensibility, but to people on the far right, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=961.4s)]
*  to people in neo-Nazi groups, white power groups, militant right groups, it is a call directly to the chain of events that leads to the Oklahoma City bombing [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=971.4s)]
*  a major act of mass casualty domestic terrorism. It is a direct call to that kind of violence. It's not just about speech. It's direct and bloody, and it has real tolls [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=981.4s)]
*  like we see in Allen and El Paso and Buffalo and Pittsburgh, and as more and more and more of these communities are impacted, that toll just grows and grows. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=996.4s)]
*  Kathleen, I wanted to ask you one last question about this young man who's the apparent shooter from Allen, Texas. He appears to be Latino, and there's been a lot of discussion about the fact that he's [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1007.4s)]
*  identifying himself as per reporting, essentially with the Nazi movement and neo-Nazi movement and advancing white supremacists and anti-Semitic views. As a man who appears to be Latino himself, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1020.4s)]
*  how do you describe that as a dynamic here as somebody who's studied the white power movement? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1033.4s)]
*  So I think this is relatively new, and it's critically important to understand because this claim to a neo-Nazi set of ideas by someone who might be classified as Latino in many U.S. settings is true not just for the Allen gunmen, but for many other people, including other people in the Proud Boys. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1038.4s)]
*  And we don't know yet whether the gunman was part of Proud Boys. Certainly he was wearing patches that, as you mentioned, are sold by Proud Boys. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1062.4s)]
*  But there's a direct linkage between something like right-wing death squad and the slogan that comes with it, which is Pinochet was right, to Latin American ideas about whiteness. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1070.4s)]
*  So Pinochet is the infamous Argentinian dictator who dealt with his political enemies. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1083.4s)]
*  Often many of the enemies were characterized as racial others by simply throwing them out of helicopters over the ocean. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1089.4s)]
*  Proud Boys were wearing shirts that said Pinochet was right, right-wing death squad, way back, even before the last round of presidential debates, long before January 6. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1098.4s)]
*  So these things are imbricated. And the other thing to understand, and this has a long history, it's complex, I'll do it here just very quickly, but people can read more about this. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1109.4s)]
*  Ideas about whiteness and what counts as white and who might be under the umbrella of being included in Nazism are very, very different from country to country. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1119.4s)]
*  One of the striking things in the the Allen, Texas shooters purported social media are images of people who in the United States would present as Latino wearing Nazi dress and not just the shooter, groups and groups of people wearing Nazi uniforms, wearing Nazi symbols, and really taking on this ideology as their own. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1129.4s)]
*  In Latin America, there's often a different racial hierarchy. Whiteness has to do with a larger amount of Spanish heritage and a smaller amount of indigenous or African heritage. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1152.4s)]
*  And all of these ideas are socially constructed. So this is difficult, but the outcome is not difficult to understand. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1164.4s)]
*  The outcome is anti-American targeted violence at communities of color, Jewish communities, other sort of racial enemy communities, and at our institutions of democratic governance. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1173.4s)]
*  Kathleen Ballou, Associate Professor of History at Northwestern University. Kathleen, thank you for your time and your expertise tonight. I appreciate you being here. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1185.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1193.4s)]
*  I will mention Pinochet Chilean, not Argentinian. A slip of the tongue there. But other than that, we will be right back. Stay with us. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1194.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1203.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRZvFrzs0B4&t=1233.4s)]
