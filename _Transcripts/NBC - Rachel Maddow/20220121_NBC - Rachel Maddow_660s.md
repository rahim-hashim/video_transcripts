# Justice Thomas Ignores Basic Ethics Where Wife's Activism, Lobbying Conflict With Cases
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8)
*  What I'm about to show you now is a social media post shared by a prominent conservative activist just before the 2020 election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  It shows Hillary Clinton House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris all [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=7.48s)]
*  Shaking hands with people purported to be family members of George Soros [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=13.32s)]
*  We bled there [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=17.72s)]
*  We blurred their faces because we don't actually know who those people are and you can see it as a pretty classic [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=18.62s)]
*  Example of the anti-semitic conspiracy theory that Jewish philanthropist George Soros is some kind of secret puppet master to Democratic Party politicians [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=23.82s)]
*  Quote who is really running the Democratic Party dot dot dot the Soros family quote [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=32.06s)]
*  George Soros is training his family to carry on his evil legacy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=37.84s)]
*  Here is another social media post from that same conservative activist from the morning of the January 6th insurrection [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=42.14s)]
*  Just before insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol quote watch MAGA crowd today best with right-side [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=48.98s)]
*  Broadcasting and then c-span for what the Congress does love MAGA people and then a little bit later on January 6th the same [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=55.86s)]
*  conservative activists posted again quote God bless each of you standing up or praying [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=62.74s)]
*  They might say well, it's the kind of bonkers [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=68.66s)]
*  Conspiracism that we've had to get used to from the online pro-trump, right in recent years [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=71.7s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that might have been posted by I don't know Mike Flynn or the Mike pillow guy or maybe the QAnon [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=76.46s)]
*  Sharman it wasn't it wasn't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=82.46s)]
*  Any of those people all of that MAGA world nonsense was posted by Ginny Thomas the wife of sitting [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=85.46s)]
*  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for decades now even before her husband was on the Supreme Court [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=92.94s)]
*  Ginny Thomas has been active in the fringier parts of the conservative movement [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=98.82s)]
*  During the Trump era she ratcheted it up a notch promoting conspiracy theories about leftist coups [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=103.86s)]
*  Mocking victims of school shootings and of course making baseless claims about Democrats stealing elections [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  Now you might be saying to yourself so what sure that all sounds nutty [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=116.9s)]
*  But lots of people post strange things on social media doesn't mean their spouse is necessarily [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=120.62s)]
*  Indulge or believe those things as well, but Ginny Thomas is not just posting things on social media last year [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  The Washington Post first reported that Ginny Thomas was active in an online forum for former law clerks of Clarence Thomas [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=131.67999999999998s)]
*  Where the New Yorker reports she openly fought with Thomas's former clerks about Trump's election loss [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  alongside Trump lawyer and big lie promoter John Eastman [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=143.55999999999997s)]
*  Imagine that you are one of the few people in the American legal community to get the prestigious job [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Clerking for a Supreme Court justice and the boss's wife is berating you about Trump losing the election [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=152.48s)]
*  She's also attacked the January 6th investigation and called on Republicans to retaliate against Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for their participation [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=159.32s)]
*  In it as her husband sits on the court weighing decisions about that very investigation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=166.8s)]
*  Which is why no one should have been surprised when the Supreme Court issued its 8 to 1 ruling ordering the National Archives [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=172.84s)]
*  To hand Trump's records over to those investigators earlier this week and the one justice who sided with Trump in that decision was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=178.84s)]
*  drumroll [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=187.08s)]
*  Clarence Thomas [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=188.8s)]
*  What would you say if you saw this in another country a judge on the high court? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=190.36s)]
*  Trying to shield a disgraced former leader from being investigated for instigating a coup while the wife of that judge [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=195.12s)]
*  attacks the investigators and promotes the lie that spurred the coup in the first place and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=201.84s)]
*  What if anything can be done about it here? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=208.08s)]
*  Joining us now is New Yorker Chief Washington correspondent Jane Mayer who has a must-read new piece on Ginny Thomas at the New Yorker [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=212.28s)]
*  Titled is Ginny Thomas a threat to the Supreme Court? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=219.48s)]
*  Thank you for being here Jane in your fascinating piece [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=222.92s)]
*  It's it's a stunning piece you quote a law professor an expert on legal ethics who says the appearance [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  Created by Clarence and Ginny Thomas is awful [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=232.16s)]
*  They look like a mom-and-pop political hack group where she does the political stuff and he does the judging [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  Now a lot of you as a home might say yeah, she's awful [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=241.2s)]
*  She says crazy things [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  But a husband shouldn't be held responsible for his wife's views and a wife shouldn't have to stop her activism because of her husband's job [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=244.76s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=250.76s)]
*  Well, I mean I understand the argument and I certainly don't think that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=253.32s)]
*  Wives should be unable to have separate careers from their husbands [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=257.8s)]
*  But there's something else going on here that's really important and it's what really struck me when I was doing this reporting [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=262.0s)]
*  Which was that she is involved in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=267.72s)]
*  Substantial ways in leadership roles with groups and activists who have business in front of her husband's court [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=271.2s)]
*  she's not just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=278.44s)]
*  taking a separate role and I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=280.44s)]
*  Think we just lost Jane Mayer there in the middle of a very interesting answer about Ginny Thomas [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=283.92s)]
*  We're gonna see if we can get her back [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=288.88s)]
*  We were just speaking with the New Yorkers chief Washington [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=292.2s)]
*  Correspondent Jane Mayer about her fascinating new look into the life of Ginny Thomas wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in that piece [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=295.0s)]
*  She recounts all sorts of interesting moments including from around the time of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings at that time [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=301.52s)]
*  Ginny Thomas had a private panel discussion where she told a conservative crowd the deep state is serious and it's resisting President Trump [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=308.52s)]
*  She declared twice that her adversaries were trying to kill people and drew applause by saying may we all have guns and concealed carry [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=315.79999999999995s)]
*  to handle what's coming [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=322.44s)]
*  Charming joining us now is Jane Mayer who wrote that piece [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=324.52s)]
*  Jane great to have you back with a bit of a technical issue a moment ago [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=328.04s)]
*  You were telling us about the conflicts of interest involving some of the conservative groups [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=330.8s)]
*  That she leads or sits on the boards of and the cases that come before the courts involving those conservative groups [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=335.0s)]
*  And one of the shocking examples that stood out to me from your piece in terms of conflict is the Muslim ban decision in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=340.96s)]
*  2018 and not just because I'm Muslim myself [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=346.96s)]
*  Clarence Thomas was one of the justices who upheld Trump's Muslim ban [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=349.36s)]
*  Without revealing that Ginny was a paid consultant to one of the far-right groups that has submitted an amicus brief to the court in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=353.0s)]
*  favor of the ban saying Islam needs to be confronted and he just never revealed that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean and she was paid a lot. I mean over two years. It was I think [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=366.12s)]
*  $234,000 in order to represent Frank Gaffney's group. He's the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=372.88s)]
*  anti-muslim activist and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  He submitted a an amicus brief to the court on the issue and Clarence Thomas heard the case never [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=380.56s)]
*  Nobody ever mentioned that she was being paid by one side in the case [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=387.8s)]
*  And if you look at Clarence Thomas's disclosures, you see absolutely no no evidence of this whatsoever [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=393.0s)]
*  you know, the only way I found it was by having to look at the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  the the IRS filings from the group that Frank Gaffney runs [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=403.91999999999996s)]
*  And so I mean it's it's it's I [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=408.76s)]
*  mean, it's there are rules and they do apply to almost every judge in this country that say that if your spouse has [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=412.08s)]
*  An interest in a case you need to recuse [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=420.16s)]
*  if a reasonable person thinks that there is an an image of that of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=423.36s)]
*  Partiality if it looks like the judge might have a conflict and can't be fair [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=431.08s)]
*  He's supposed to step down but that applies to only the lower courts [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=435.32s)]
*  Not to the Supreme Court because it holds itself above the ethics code that applies to the rest of the judges in this country [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=440.88s)]
*  and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=448.08s)]
*  As you point out in your piece [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=449.12s)]
*  Sonia Sotomayor Brett Kavanaugh Steven Breyer [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=452.88s)]
*  They've all recused themselves when friends or family have been involved in a case that's come before the court [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=455.76s)]
*  But Clarence Thomas has never recused himself for a case that involved a group linked to Ginny his wife [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Were you surprised to see Clarence Thomas as the only justice to oppose? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=468.16s)]
*  Releasing Trump's records to the 1-6 committee just weeks after his wife was publicly attacking the 1-6 committee [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  well, I mean I think to me the issue is that it suggests that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=479.6s)]
*  He's not [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=486.68s)]
*  Judging issues fairly he may be it raises questions at least about whether he's favoring his wife's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=488.24s)]
*  Political activism and and and I think that that's dangerous as he said himself for the court [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  You really need the country to look at that that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=504.08s)]
*  Incredibly important court and to trust that it's doing its best [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  Whatever direction it comes from [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=512.4s)]
*  Ideologically to arrive at justice and at a fair a fair decision [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=514.4s)]
*  and I think what the problem with Ginny Thomas's activism is is it it's it's almost impossible at this point to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=518.68s)]
*  See all the things that she's involved with that are in front of the court and not have some questions about whether it taints his [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=526.48s)]
*  point of view [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=533.76s)]
*  Well, a lot of us have questions about what Ginny Thomas was saying on January the 6th [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=535.56s)]
*  She says she put those social media posts up before the violence kick kicked off [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=539.52s)]
*  But we are all wondering about what her views were on January the 6th [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=543.36s)]
*  Let me ask you this what if anything can actually be done here to fix this issue [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=547.24s)]
*  Because you can't force a justice to recuse themselves. You can't forcibly remove them from the court [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  You can impeach them [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=557.04s)]
*  But it's only about I believe according to your piece has only been tried once and it didn't succeed [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  So is there any rules that can be changed anything that could be done? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=561.76s)]
*  There there actually is quite a bit that can be done and there have been some efforts there have been [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=566.22s)]
*  several bills that have been proposed in Congress to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  try to get the court to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=577.38s)]
*  Abide by a judicial code an ethics code like the lower courts [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=580.5s)]
*  I think it's it's an issue that has a certain amount of [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=585.62s)]
*  Traction. I think there there is a lot of interest. There's even some bipartisan interest in it [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=590.62s)]
*  And I think there's also a good chance that after [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=595.34s)]
*  People have taken a close look at this financial issue involving Jenny Thomas that they may close some loopholes [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IemrkukybJ8&t=599.22s)]
