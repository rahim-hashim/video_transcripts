# Lesson Of 'Little Green Men' Prompts U.S. Strategy Of Radical Transparency On Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac)
*  It was February 2014. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=0.0s)]
*  The autocratic pro-Russian ruler of Ukraine had just fled the country after being forced out of office by pro-democracy street protests. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=3.0s)]
*  And in that confusing aftermath, soldiers began appearing in the southern Ukrainian province of Crimea. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=12.0s)]
*  The soldiers had no identifying insignia. They wore plain green uniforms. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=19.0s)]
*  And they came to be known as the Little Green Men. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=24.0s)]
*  Some of them stormed Crimea's regional parliament. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=28.0s)]
*  They barricaded themselves inside and they raised the Russian flag over the building. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=31.0s)]
*  The next day, more of these green uniformed men seized airports in Crimea. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=36.0s)]
*  Within a couple of weeks, the whole of Crimea was under the control of these Little Green Men. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=42.0s)]
*  They were clearly pro-Russian. They spoke Russian and they were heavily armed with Russian weapons. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=48.0s)]
*  But Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted they were not Russian troops. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=54.0s)]
*  He said they were local self-defense forces acting on their own. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=59.0s)]
*  Hey, he couldn't help it if the people of Crimea liked Russia more than they liked the new pro-Western government in Ukraine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=65.0s)]
*  The confusion led to headlines like this one from the BBC. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=72.0s)]
*  Russians, in quotation mark, occupy Crimea airports. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=76.0s)]
*  So it was clear to everyone on the ground in Crimea that these were Russian soldiers in disguise. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=81.0s)]
*  But the entire Russian government was denying from top to bottom that they were Russian soldiers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=87.0s)]
*  NATO and the US seemed kind of flummoxed about how to respond. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=94.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you stop an invasion when you can't even get everyone to agree that an invasion is happening? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=98.0s)]
*  Then Vice President Joe Biden flew to Poland to reassure Eastern European allies that the US had their back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=105.0s)]
*  By the time he got there, the occupation of Crimea was a done deal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=112.0s)]
*  The day Biden arrived, Putin announced that Crimea was now part of Russia. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=117.0s)]
*  Fast forward to today, as Russia once again menaces Ukraine, this time with 130,000 troops on its borders, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=123.0s)]
*  a number that is growing every day. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=131.0s)]
*  And now President Biden, President Joe Biden, apparently wants to make sure his administration does not repeat the mistakes of 2014. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=134.0s)]
*  According to a report this weekend in The New York Times, back then it wasn't that the US government didn't know what Russia was up to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=142.0s)]
*  They just didn't tell anyone. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=149.0s)]
*  Quote, the Biden administration is determined not to see a repeat of 2014 when NATO was confused and caught by surprise [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=152.0s)]
*  when Russian forces took over Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, largely unopposed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=160.0s)]
*  Senior Obama administration officials recalled their frustration when the intelligence agencies would not allow the White House [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=165.0s)]
*  to tell NATO, let alone the public, what Washington knew about Russia's moves. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=172.0s)]
*  I can remember a dozen times when I thought our interests would be advanced if we just told the world what we knew, said Michael McFaul, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=177.0s)]
*  who was the US ambassador to Russia when it annexed Crimea. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=184.0s)]
*  And so now, today, we have the opposite, the US government declassifying and publicizing at a breakneck pace [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=188.0s)]
*  what it says it knows about Russia's plans, from the movements of Russia's forces to its alleged plans to launch false flag operations [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=198.0s)]
*  to new urgent warnings that an invasion could come any day. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=206.0s)]
*  According to The Times, quote, the hope is that disclosing Mr. Putin's plans will disrupt them. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=212.0s)]
*  It is, quote, information warfare between the US and Russia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=218.0s)]
*  . [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVATjb5T0ac&t=236.0s)]
