# Listen: Audio Contradicts McCarthy's Denial In Recommending Trump's Resignation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ)
*  Here's what Mr. Burns and Mr. Martin say about Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, on January 10th, so four days after the attack on the Capitol, Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=4.8s)]
*  convened a small group of House Republican leaders to share his thinking. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=9.92s)]
*  Speaking with just three other top Republicans on a private call, McCarthy said he might [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  call on Trump to resign. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=18.54s)]
*  He conferred for more than 45 minutes with Steve Scalise, Liz Cheney, and Tom Emmer, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=21.66s)]
*  the Minnesota congressman who led the House Republicans campaign committee. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=27.34s)]
*  The usually upbeat Mr. McCarthy was audibly anguished. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=31.34s)]
*  The gravity of the attack was still sinking in, and it seemed increasingly clear to him [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=35.34s)]
*  that he had to break with Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=39.22s)]
*  It was finally time to end their alliance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=41.34s)]
*  His plan, McCarthy said on that January 10th call, was to approach President Trump and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=44.42s)]
*  tell him it was inevitable that Congress would impeach him and it was time for him to go. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=49.2s)]
*  He envisioned telling Trump of an impeachment resolution, quote, I think this will pass, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=55.04s)]
*  and it would be my recommendation you should resign. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=61.62s)]
*  I think this will pass, meaning the impeachment resolution will pass, meaning you will be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=65.36s)]
*  impeached. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=69.64s)]
*  Quote, it would be my recommendation that you should resign. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=70.64s)]
*  McCarthy said near the end of the call, quote, I've had it with this guy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=75.12s)]
*  What he did was unacceptable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=79.16s)]
*  We can defend that and nobody should defend it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=81.2s)]
*  Now, it is one thing to know that Kevin McCarthy once felt that way and once told his colleagues [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=85.28s)]
*  that he intended to do those things that he described. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  And of course, now you couldn't slide a sheet of paper between him and Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=96.92s)]
*  He decided to just jettison those apparently principled concerns and pledge his loyalty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  to Trump once again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=106.4s)]
*  I mean, that's one thing that tells you something about Mr. McCarthy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=107.84s)]
*  In their new book, Mr. Martin and Mr. Burns call it simply surrender by Mr. McCarthy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=112.0s)]
*  That's the word they use. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=116.92s)]
*  But you know, it's another thing entirely for him to deny that this all happened when, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=120.16s)]
*  in fact, it happened. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=125.76s)]
*  In a statement to The New York Times earlier today, a spokesman for Kevin McCarthy issued [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=128.08s)]
*  a flat denial that McCarthy ever said he would push Trump to resign. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=131.82s)]
*  A spokesman said, quote, McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=136.02s)]
*  McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  To further clarify, you should also know that NBC News reached out to the congressman's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  office following that statement, specifically asking again and drilling down on the question [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=152.38s)]
*  of whether or not Mr. McCarthy said he would push President Trump to resign. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  His spokesman responded saying, quote, No, he did not. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=164.1s)]
*  Leader McCarthy also issued a statement himself today saying, in part, quote, The New York [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=171.38s)]
*  Times reporting on me is totally false and wrong. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=174.44s)]
*  The problem with these denials from Mr. McCarthy in his office is that we have now obtained [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=178.22s)]
*  audio of that January 10th phone call that Leader McCarthy held with other top Republicans [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=182.9s)]
*  in which he in fact said he's going to call Trump and tell him that he must resign. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=188.72s)]
*  The authors of this new book, Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns from The New York Times, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  they have shared that audio of this call with us so that we can share it with you tonight [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=198.14s)]
*  so that you can know that when Kevin McCarthy denies that this happened, he is not telling [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  the truth. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=209.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=210.0s)]
*  Liz, you on the phone? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=213.0s)]
*  Thanks, Kevin. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=214.0s)]
*  I guess first a question. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=215.0s)]
*  When we were talking about the 25th Amendment resolution, and you asked what happens if [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=216.0s)]
*  a kid's there after he's gone, is there any chance, are you hearing, that he might resign? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=224.0s)]
*  Is there any reason to think that might happen? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=229.0s)]
*  I've had a few discussions. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=233.0s)]
*  My gut tells me no. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=237.0s)]
*  I'm seriously thinking of having that conversation with him tonight. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=239.0s)]
*  I haven't talked to him in a couple days. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=245.0s)]
*  From what I know of him, I mean, you guys all know him too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=249.0s)]
*  Do you think he'd ever back away? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=253.0s)]
*  But what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to call him. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=255.0s)]
*  This is what I think. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=259.0s)]
*  I know that he'll pass the House. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=261.0s)]
*  I think there's a chance he'll pass the Senate even when he's gone. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=265.0s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of different ramifications for that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=271.0s)]
*  Now, I haven't had a discussion with him that if he did resign, would it not happen? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=275.0s)]
*  Now, this is one personal feel I have. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=282.0s)]
*  I do not want to get into any conversation about Pence pardoning. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=286.0s)]
*  I mean, the only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=291.0s)]
*  And it would be my recommendation we should resign. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=296.0s)]
*  I mean, that would be my take, but I don't think he would take it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=301.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=306.0s)]
*  The discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=309.0s)]
*  I think the impeachment resolution will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=313.0s)]
*  I mean, that would be my take. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=319.0s)]
*  It would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that you should resign. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=322.0s)]
*  That's what Kevin McCarthy told other House Republicans on January 10th, 2011, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=327.0s)]
*  that he was going to call President Trump and tell him the impeachment was going to pass and he needed to resign. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=333.0s)]
*  Mr. McCarthy flat out and categorically denied that today. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=338.0s)]
*  He denied that he said he would tell Trump to resign. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=342.0s)]
*  He, in fact, said exactly that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To-zii1kJmQ&t=345.0s)]
