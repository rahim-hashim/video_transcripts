# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 25
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks)
*  For all the geopolitics, for all the drama and the diplomacy, at the human level, these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  are just bluntly terrifying times for our fellow human beings who live in the Ukrainian [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=27.92s)]
*  capital city of Kyiv. For the second straight night tonight, loud explosions and heavy gunfire [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=34.08s)]
*  have been heard in the capital city. Just a few hours ago, Ukraine's president told Kyiv residents [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  to prepare for what could be a long and difficult night with Russian forces expected to be storming [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=43.84s)]
*  the city. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops are approaching Kyiv from the north, through [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=49.92s)]
*  Belarus, and also from areas under Russian control in the east of Ukraine. Ukrainian artillery and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=55.2s)]
*  tanks have also been seen moving through the city of Kyiv. Earlier today, we saw reports of thousands [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  of Ukrainian volunteers lining up at recruitment centers to receive weapons, to try to fight on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=67.04s)]
*  their own, to try to help their own country's military withstand the assault. The UN estimates [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  that more than 50,000 people have already left Ukraine. A hundred thousand more have been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=79.2s)]
*  displaced inside Ukraine, and many others are just trapped where they are with nowhere a way to move [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=82.96s)]
*  around. One of them is a man named Alexander Prokorenko. He's a restaurant owner. He lives in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=87.6s)]
*  central Kyiv. Two nights ago, the building where he lives, he says, was full. Life was almost normal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=93.6s)]
*  Today, that same apartment building in Kyiv is virtually empty. He's now passing the hours inside [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  with a small group of neighbors and friends that remained. They are cooking together, eating together, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=105.52s)]
*  trying to support each other, and trying to find a way out. At first, they took refuge inside one [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=111.12s)]
*  apartment in the building, but hearing explosions and air raid sirens, they decided they needed to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=116.48s)]
*  stay away from exposed doors and windows. They decided they would all go underground. They [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=120.64s)]
*  grabbed pool chairs and pillows. They've made improvised beds, and they are staying now in the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=126.48s)]
*  underground garage at their apartment. Alexander told us today the place feels like a bunker, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=131.28s)]
*  but even down there, they can still hear the explosions and the sirens outside. Alexander and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=137.2s)]
*  his group of neighbors, they say they hope to leave the city actually just in a few hours, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=141.28s)]
*  but they don't know if they'll be able to. They've got a car packed, but as of this point, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  they don't have any gas. They have enough food for a few days, but they also really have nowhere to go. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=149.76s)]
*  Joining us now live from Kyiv is Kyiv resident and restaurant owner Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Prokorenko, I'm really grateful to you for joining us tonight. I hope you're okay. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=162.32s)]
*  Yes, good evening, which is basically good morning in Kyiv, but not really good. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, tell us how you've been living, you and your neighbors, these past few days. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=175.6s)]
*  Well, we've been living. We woke up like two days ago with a large alarm saying that, you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=181.92s)]
*  we are under attack. So we all went to the basement. We knew what we were going to do, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=189.6s)]
*  but still it was a mass panic. People started to leave the city straight away. And there is still [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=196.24s)]
*  a big traffic jam to the western Ukraine. So people that usually make their way to Lviv or [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=206.72s)]
*  Ivano-Frankivsk, which takes them like six to 10 hours, they spend there like 24 or 28 hours [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=215.68s)]
*  just in the traffic jam, moving slowly to other parts of Ukraine where it's more safe. But [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  basically we know that there is no safe place now anywhere in Ukraine. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that your best option is still to get out on the road and to try to get west, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  to try to get potentially across an EU border nation? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=244.16s)]
*  Well, you never know. So I think it's, you know, we decided to stay on one place because we're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=249.44s)]
*  all together, but still, well, from yesterday morning till now, almost everybody left from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=256.48s)]
*  this building. So it was almost around a hundred people here. But since we heard that, you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=263.92s)]
*  that the troops are the military troops of Russia are moving towards the Kiev, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=270.8s)]
*  we started to hear the explosions, started to hear gunfires and worse than you. So again, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=276.16s)]
*  the third or second row of panic happened again and people just started to move out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=284.4s)]
*  I don't think there is a safe place either to stay or to go. You know, we don't know, but people, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=291.12s)]
*  as you said before, people are getting guns and, you know, to protect the city, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=298.4s)]
*  not just Kiev, but every city in Ukraine. But, you know, when we are asking everybody to help us, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=304.64s)]
*  you know, we are saying to the world, please help us, you know, don't be silent. This is our message, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=310.48s)]
*  you know, we don't want to fight. We don't want war. We never wanted a war. We are a good and happy [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  country. So. Your president made a appeal, essentially, essentially gave a warning to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=325.36s)]
*  residents of Kiev tonight saying it is going to get bad. The expectations are that it's bad. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=332.8s)]
*  They've also called for people to anybody you can fight to fight. I guess I feel like us watching [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=338.16s)]
*  from the outside, your president is very visible and there's a lot of concern that Russian troops [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=344.64s)]
*  are going to come in and try to find him and kill him and proverbially decapitate the government [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=348.88s)]
*  and replace it with some sort of Russian puppet regime. I have to ask if seeing him make the kind [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=353.52s)]
*  of public pronouncements that he's made, seeing him staying in Kiev and talking the way that he [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=358.64s)]
*  is to you and other Kiev residents, if that's at all heartening to you or how you feel about that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=363.84s)]
*  Well, we feel strong support from the president because, you know, he's always reporting [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  the latest news of what we did and where is the enemy and what we're going to do. Yes, and yesterday [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  we got all his messages. He's very active in the Instagram and saying that he's there and all of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=384.64s)]
*  his team is there. So and we feel, you know, like we are all united and, you know, but still we're a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  little country. We cannot fight again big military government as Russia. So this is, this is, yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=399.2s)]
*  Kiev resident, restaurant owner Alexander Prokorenko, Mr. Prokorenko, good luck to you [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=410.88s)]
*  and your neighbors with everything that you're going through. Keep us surprised. Stay in touch [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=416.8s)]
*  with us. Let us know what we can do. We'd love to be in touch as you go through this journey. Good [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=420.96s)]
*  luck to you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And we're looking, looking to the, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=425.44s)]
*  to the world and, and, and to the world support, please don't stay aside. You know, we're, we're [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=430.8s)]
*  waiting for you and for the whole world to support us and to help us. Thank you very much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=437.84s)]
*  God bless you. Good luck to you. And in Mariupol tonight in southeastern Ukraine, we have our friend [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=445.12s)]
*  Richard Engel, NBC's chief foreign correspondent, who is live in the middle of the night [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=451.2s)]
*  in a part of that country that has just been besieged today. Richard, thank you for being [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=455.6s)]
*  with us tonight. Again, I know it is the middle of the night where you are. Tell us about what [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=460.8s)]
*  the day has been like. Tell us about you've been seeing tonight. So this is a difficult day because [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=464.88000000000005s)]
*  we are now seeing the Russian army moving on the cities, moving on the Capitol, trying to take [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=472.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine in one foul swoop. They hope that by knocking out the Capitol, knocking out Zelensky, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=478.72s)]
*  that they can install a puppet regime and, and win the whole country and then enact a campaign of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=486.24s)]
*  repression. And I've been speaking with intelligence officials. I've been speaking with, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=493.12s)]
*  with locals here, with local commanders, and the reason they're fighting so hard and they are [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  fighting hard is because they know what is at stake if they lose. They not only lose their [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=503.2s)]
*  democracy, but they completely anticipate that there will be a campaign of repression carried [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  out against them. And US officials have been warning about this and US officials have said [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=515.6s)]
*  that they've drawn up kill lists and Ukrainians believe them. They believe that what would be, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=520.16s)]
*  what would follow a loss of this country to Vladimir Putin would be a campaign of human [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=527.2s)]
*  rights abuses and war crimes potentially carried out by a force called the Rosgardia. And they are, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=534.6400000000001s)]
*  I've been told the ones to watch out for that they will be the ones enforcing a crackdown [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=540.96s)]
*  and trying to, quote, pacify the population. So if they don't hold out, they know that, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=548.0s)]
*  that they could lose everything. Richard, we did hear from the Pentagon today that as far as US [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=555.12s)]
*  intelligence knows about Russia's own expectations for this incursion, they're behind schedule. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=562.32s)]
*  They haven't been going as fast as they intended to go or that they expected to go. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=568.72s)]
*  We also had confirmation from the Pentagon today that it doesn't seem like there's anywhere in the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=573.6s)]
*  country that Russian forces, any city, any population center in the nation of Ukraine [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=577.68s)]
*  where Russian forces are in control, where they're actually holding territory. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=582.72s)]
*  Is this just a matter of pacing or is there any way for us to tell from your conversations with [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=587.36s)]
*  military leaders and intelligence sources, is there any way to tell whether Russia's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  basically proceeding according to plan or whether they're having more trouble than they expected? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=598.64s)]
*  So they are having more trouble than expected. They were slow coming in from the North. They [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=604.96s)]
*  had trouble crossing a river when they came down from Belarus. The Ukrainians have knocked out [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=610.4s)]
*  several bridges also in the North, which has been slowing them down. They faced some fairly heavy [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=615.1999999999999s)]
*  fighting in the South, but the forces were taking their time controlling the canals out of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=620.72s)]
*  the Crimean Peninsula that controls the flow of water to the peninsula. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=627.36s)]
*  But the biggest factor, which has some Western officials surprised, is that Russia hasn't put [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  all of its forces into this fight yet. They only have about a third of their forces committed, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=638.56s)]
*  so they still have a lot of fight left in them. That only about two-thirds of their force remain [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=644.88s)]
*  on the borders in Russian territory, ready to be deployed. So it's only day two and the Ukrainians [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=654.0s)]
*  have been holding out well, and Western officials are impressed with the fighting spirit of [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=661.92s)]
*  Zelensky, but they know that Russia has a numerically superior and technologically superior army, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=668.4s)]
*  which it has largely kept still in Russia, but which apparently it plans to deploy at some stage, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  and it is unclear why it has not deployed the full force yet. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=685.5999999999999s)]
*  Richard Engel, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent. As you say, Richard, this has been a difficult [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  day. This is a dark day and a long day ahead for you tomorrow. Stay safe, my friend. Thank you. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  Today I learned that when professional tennis stars win big matches, one thing they do, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=701.92s)]
*  it's kind of a weird newish tradition. I don't know how long this has been going on, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=710.24s)]
*  I don't know how long this has been going on, but a thing they sometimes do is they take a marker, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=713.76s)]
*  they take a pen, and they write something on the lens of a TV camera that has been covering the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=718.32s)]
*  match they just won. How did this start? I don't know, but this is the thing they do. Here's [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=724.16s)]
*  Naomi Osaka drawing this little cat. That's the thing she does. This is an Italian guy who won a [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=728.96s)]
*  match even though he had the stomach flu. What he wrote on the camera lens was, thank you, Imodium. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=735.44s)]
*  Which is really funny if you have a six-year-old sense of humor, which I absolutely do. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=744.24s)]
*  This is a thing that tennis stars do when they win matches. Right now there's a big pro tennis [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=751.52s)]
*  tournament on in Dubai and a Russian player named Andrei Rublev, R-U-B-L-E-V, Andrei Rublev. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=755.44s)]
*  He's ranked number seven in the world. He's at that Dubai tournament and he won a match there [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=763.28s)]
*  that will advance him to the final. When he won today's match, he didn't say anything, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=767.68s)]
*  but he did walk over to the nearest TV camera and he took out a pen and he wrote on the camera lens, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=773.28s)]
*  no war, please. Again, he's the number seven ranked men's tennis player in the world. He is Russian. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=779.92s)]
*  This was his note to the camera today upon winning that match. The number one ranked [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  U.S. man in the world is also Russian. His name is Daniel Medvedev. He is playing at a big [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=794.96s)]
*  tournament in Mexico right now. This was his wife sitting in the stands watching him at that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=800.08s)]
*  Mexico tournament. We dropped the lower third there so you can see what she's wearing. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=806.0s)]
*  We dropped that. There it is. She's wearing a shirt in the colors of the Ukrainian flag [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=810.24s)]
*  while she was in the stands there watching her husband play. Again, he's the number one ranked [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  men's tennis player in the world. The most famous Russian athlete in the whole world is the massive [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=819.52s)]
*  hockey star Alex Ovechkin who plays for the National Hockey League in the United States. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=826.08s)]
*  Ovechkin has previously been an outspoken supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=831.12s)]
*  but today he told reporters, quote, please no more war. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=836.48s)]
*  At home in Russia, the biggest star on that country's wildly popular national soccer team [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=843.44s)]
*  is a striker named Fedor Smolov. He just posted on Instagram, no to war, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  with the Ukrainian flag and a broken heart emoji next to it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=856.72s)]
*  International Soccer just announced that Russia will no longer be allowed to host the Champions [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=861.2800000000001s)]
*  League final. They were going to be hosting that in St. Petersburg in May. That match has been [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=865.0400000000001s)]
*  yanked from Russia now. Formula One car racing has also pulled its next major race out of Russia. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=870.48s)]
*  The Eurovision Song Contest announced today that Russia will not be allowed to have a team [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=877.36s)]
*  compete in this year's Eurovision. And as Americans, we don't tend to care that much [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  about the Eurovision Song Contest, but it is an absolute national obsession in Russia and across [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=887.68s)]
*  most of Europe. Russia's been kicked out of it for this year. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=894.72s)]
*  You know, and each of these things is, I know, it's a little Lego in a larger brick wall, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=898.88s)]
*  sports stars saying a thing, you know, cultural things being canceled, sports things being pulled [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=904.72s)]
*  out of Russia, business decisions. They're all little Lego blocks, but they're adding up to a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=912.24s)]
*  wall that is starting to amount to global ostracism, global pariah status for Russia, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  thanks to the actions of their president, Vladimir Putin. And it's one thing for a country to do [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  something unpopular and to be treated as such globally. It is another thing for a nation's [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  leader to do something like that while his own people hate what he's doing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  For Vladimir Putin, this moment of global ostracism, global pariah status comes as his own [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=941.12s)]
*  people hate it. Russian music stars, Russian cultural figures, now the biggest sports figures [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=947.84s)]
*  in the country, they are all braving the considerable wrath of that dictatorship to speak [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=953.6s)]
*  out publicly against this insane war that Putin has started. Every day Russians all over that [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=958.48s)]
*  country, even though Russians are being threatened with prosecution as rioters and terrorists, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  if they dare to turn up to any sort of protest against the war in Ukraine, yesterday, Russian [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  citizens were arrested for protesting anyway in more than 50 different Russian cities. Today, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  another 500 Russian citizens were arrested for again, defying their increasingly unhinged [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=979.9200000000001s)]
*  government to go protest in the streets against Putin waging this war. Joining us now is Sherilyn [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=985.6s)]
*  Eiffel. She is president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=992.96s)]
*  Ms. Eiffel, it is an honor and pleasure to see you tonight. Thank you so much for making time. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=997.44s)]
*  It's a historic night. It is indeed. And welcome back, Rachel. Thank you. Let me just ask you, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1001.6s)]
*  if you think Judge Jackson will be confirmed, whether you think this will be politically a [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1010.0s)]
*  controversial nomination and what kind of Supreme Court justice you think she'll make if she in fact [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1014.96s)]
*  is confirmed? Well, I think that I think everyone knows that Judge Jackson will be confirmed. She [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1021.0400000000001s)]
*  was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year by a vote of 53 to 44. She garnered the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1030.48s)]
*  votes of three Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham. You just described her record, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1038.32s)]
*  Rachel, as one that is very moderate, highly accomplished, and looks very much like the resume [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1043.1999999999998s)]
*  of others on the Supreme Court. The only difference is that she's a black woman and the first black [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1050.0s)]
*  woman who will sit on that court. So I know she'll be confirmed, but that doesn't mean that it's an [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1056.08s)]
*  easy road. We already see today Judge Jackson being called out of her name and out of her record. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1061.04s)]
*  Being described as a radical leftist, the suggestion that there's something about her that [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1067.52s)]
*  means that we should beware and that we should have caution. And this has been the history of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  those trailblazing judges like Thurgood Marshall and like Constance Baker Motley, the first black [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1080.16s)]
*  woman federal judge who Judge Jackson referenced today. When Judge Motley was nominated to sit on [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1085.44s)]
*  the Southern District of New York to become a federal district court judge, there were [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1092.48s)]
*  senators who were trolling through her record and insisting that when she was 19 years old, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1096.48s)]
*  she had been affiliated with communists. If you read the transcript of Thurgood Marshall's [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1101.44s)]
*  confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, it is shameful. And this is after he had already been [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1106.4s)]
*  confirmed as Solicitor General and as a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. So we've [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  seen this playbook. They can't stop the train, but their hope is to try to degrade and undermine [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1115.92s)]
*  the historic and really beautiful and important moment that we are seeing. And I appreciate [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1122.64s)]
*  President Biden for describing it in the way he did for too long. Our government hasn't looked [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1128.48s)]
*  like us, but you know, I connected, Rachel, with your earlier segment about the Ukraine, a country [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1132.48s)]
*  that is being overtaken by this hostile power that comes to crush us, crush it. You know, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1137.44s)]
*  it reminds us of how important it is to fight for your democracy. And what we have seen over the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1144.24s)]
*  past six or seven years is our democracy crumbling from within and how we strengthen our democracy [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1150.08s)]
*  as we live up to our ideals. We demonstrate that there is equality, that there's justice, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1155.76s)]
*  that there's opportunity, that all members of our society can participate. And we recognize the need [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1161.12s)]
*  particularly for the branch of government responsible for interpreting the law to do so in a [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1167.36s)]
*  way that includes multiple perspectives from people of different experiences and backgrounds [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1172.96s)]
*  to decide what the law is. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ra-vFl76Ks&t=1179.12s)]
