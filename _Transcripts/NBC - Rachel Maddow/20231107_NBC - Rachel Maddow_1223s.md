# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Nov. 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo)
*  Donald Trump, you may have heard, today took the stand as a witness in the quarter billion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=0.0s)]
*  dollar civil trial in which he and his business are accused of years of massive financial [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  fraud. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  His testimony was chaotic and rambling by all accounts. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Legal observers broadly today said his testimony likely undercut his own lawyer's defense strategy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=17.72s)]
*  in terms of the provable allegations in this case and the amount of distance his lawyers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=23.5s)]
*  have been trying to put between him and the financial statements that are at issue in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=28.34s)]
*  this fraud case. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=32.58s)]
*  But you know, the sort of chaotic, insulting, non-sequitur character of his testimony today [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=36.14s)]
*  may not help with the sort of black letter law of this civil fraud case that he's facing, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=44.22s)]
*  but it does have a larger point for him, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=50.42s)]
*  Chaotic, rambling, non-sequitur, out of control, insulting, sort of unprofessional, inappropriate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  testimony may not help with his case, but it does make a mockery of the legal system, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  It does implicitly at least, and explicitly according to some of his testimony today, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  show that he's trying to denigrate and discredit and delegitimize not just this case against [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=74.78s)]
*  him and his company, but the whole legal system, the whole court system. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=79.94s)]
*  That does appear to be his larger goal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=83.82s)]
*  And it makes sense, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=86.02s)]
*  When your legal troubles include a couple of huge civil cases and 91 felony criminal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=88.1s)]
*  counts against you, one way to fight that is to fight each of the civil suits and each [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  of the 91 felony charges on the substance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=99.82s)]
*  Sure, you could do that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=102.18s)]
*  The easier path, though, the more efficient path is just to run against the legal system, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=103.38s)]
*  to tell your followers that the American legal system, the American system of justice [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=108.38s)]
*  and law enforcement and the judiciary and the court, it's all illegitimate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=112.32s)]
*  And your followers should see it as illegitimate, too, right? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  Tell your followers you don't intend to follow the rules of the legal system, and they shouldn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=123.34s)]
*  either. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=127.62s)]
*  Delegitimizing the legal system, delegitimizing and trying to discredit the independent judiciary [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  in the court system is, of course, the most important step toward dissolving the legal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=135.9s)]
*  system in the court system or trying to turn it into something unrecognizable in a democracy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=140.9s)]
*  We're going to talk with Washington Post reporter Devlin Barrett tonight about his new reporting, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  about the planning that's underway on the right for what to do to the U.S. legal system [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=152.82s)]
*  if Trump or another Republican is elected president next year. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=158.82s)]
*  Really chilling reporting from Devlin Barrett and his colleagues at the Washington Post. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=163.46s)]
*  We're going to have Devlin Barrett here live coming up this hour. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=167.02s)]
*  But you know, you might have seen the big political news in the last 48 hours was the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  New York Times Sienna College polling that came out this weekend about the presidential [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=177.34s)]
*  race. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=180.86s)]
*  And the headline there was that President Biden's reelection effort looks like it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=181.86s)]
*  in trouble. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=185.66s)]
*  Trump is ahead of Biden in a hypothetical general election matchup in five of six so-called [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=186.66s)]
*  battleground states. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=192.1s)]
*  Interestingly though, even in that poll, those results flip when people are asked about Trump [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=195.34s)]
*  potentially being convicted of any of the felonies he's currently charged with. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  In that same poll, all six of those six swing states would go for Biden if Trump is convicted [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=206.06s)]
*  on any count in any of his trials. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=212.18s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=216.06s)]
*  But you see how central this is to Trump's effort to try to get back into the White House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=217.26s)]
*  It's a chicken and egg thing in terms of why he wants to get there, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=221.86s)]
*  And what convictions have to be seen as by his followers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=225.5s)]
*  But you see why his effort is to try to not necessarily beat all of these charges and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=229.9s)]
*  all of these civil suits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=235.3s)]
*  It's to say that the legal system doesn't matter and the legal system isn't in power [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  and the legal system doesn't need to be obeyed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=241.86s)]
*  I thought I was sort of past being shocked. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=245.7s)]
*  I will admit I found this legitimately shocking. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  Quote, Donald Trump and his allies are drafting plans to potentially invoke the Insurrection [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=250.34s)]
*  Act on his first day in office to allow him to deploy the military against civil demonstrations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=255.62s)]
*  Quote, dubbed Project 2025, the group is developing a plan to include draft executive orders that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=263.1s)]
*  would deploy the U.S. military domestically under the Insurrection Act. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=269.34s)]
*  The proposal is identified in internal discussions as an immediate priority. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=274.58s)]
*  The guy reportedly leading the work on this Insurrection Act plan under Project 2025 is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=280.14s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark, a Trump Justice Department official who proposed having DOJ endorse fake fraud [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=285.06s)]
*  claims to effectively tell the states that they should ignore election results and keep [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=290.74s)]
*  Trump in power. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=295.58s)]
*  According to Trump's federal indictment, he allegedly favored using the Insurrection Act [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  back then to use the U.S. military to keep Trump in power. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=301.66s)]
*  Now, I should note that a spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation, which is organizing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=306.62s)]
*  this Project 2025, is denying the existence of this Insurrection Act plan. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=310.34000000000003s)]
*  But it is part of one of this, this, it's part of one of this, this fairly shocking [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=316.06s)]
*  set of new reporting from Isaac Arnstorf, Josh Dawsey and Devlin Barrett just out at [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=321.62s)]
*  the Washington Post. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=326.98s)]
*  Joining us now is Washington Post national security reporter, Devlin Barrett. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  Devlin, it's nice to see you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here tonight. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  So I have to ask you, in light of the Heritage Foundation denying the Insurrection Act part [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  of this reporting, I just have to ask you if you, if you stand by your reporting and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  what you make of that denial. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=344.18s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=345.82s)]
*  I mean, look, here's, here's the weird dynamic that the Insurrection Act has played, not [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=347.5s)]
*  just this year, but for a number of years now, which is that starting around mid-2020, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=353.26s)]
*  there were a lot of people who tried to convince Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to put [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=359.5s)]
*  down protests against police, protests against his administration, any number of things that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=365.18s)]
*  they didn't like going on in the public square. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=370.62s)]
*  So now what you have is a number of folks sort of mapping out what they would like a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=373.54s)]
*  second Trump administration to look like. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=379.32s)]
*  And one of the things they would like to see is the use of the Insurrection Act to put [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=381.86s)]
*  down any protests. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=385.94s)]
*  That is a, let's face it, fairly theoretical conversation at this point. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=387.72s)]
*  There is no second Trump administration yet. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=392.06s)]
*  There is no, you know, set of public protests to put down. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=394.62s)]
*  But I think it says a lot about the way conservatives are talking about what a second Trump administration [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  would look like, that one of the things that is right on the table right away is the Insurrection [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=406.36s)]
*  Act. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=411.24s)]
*  Yeah, the timing and it being there right away is the part of it that really has stuck [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=412.24s)]
*  with me. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, if there aren't big civil demonstrations to put down, right, which is the theoretical [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  justification for something like the Insurrection Act, is that you're understanding that they're [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=422.64s)]
*  preparing these executive orders, they're preparing these potential actions essentially [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=426.0s)]
*  to invoke the Insurrection Act as soon as he's president. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's there as a proverbial loaded gun for him to use whenever he feels like it, rather [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  than expecting it to have to be reactive to something that they're anticipating actually [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=438.2s)]
*  happening in the country. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=442.46s)]
*  Sure, but I think there's one word of caution here to understand, which is that this is [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  what some folks around Trump and some folks who hope to be part of the second Trump administration [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  would like to see happen. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=455.48s)]
*  That doesn't necessarily mean that Trump has adopted these things, that Trump already [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=457.32000000000005s)]
*  wants to do these things. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  I think one of the big conversations going on in conservative circles right now as we [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=462.92s)]
*  speak, and this is a big part of what we are trying to report on and explain, is that there's [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=468.24s)]
*  a lot of conservatives, including conservative lawyers, who are trying to argue out like [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=472.8s)]
*  what should their role, if any, be in a second Trump administration? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=477.76s)]
*  Because increasingly it looks like he will be the nominee. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=482.48s)]
*  So there's a lot of Republicans who have to make choices right now. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  And this is part of the discussion of those choices. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=488.76s)]
*  Yeah, the legal profession has some choices to make too, in terms of its own professional [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=491.6s)]
*  responsibilities. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=496.2s)]
*  Washington Post national security reporter Devlin Barrett, this is chilling and fascinating [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=497.44s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=502.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=504.2s)]
*  Americans have a favorable view of labor unions by a huge margin right now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=506.44s)]
*  71% support. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=512.52s)]
*  That's higher than at any time in my lifetime. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=514.24s)]
*  That is higher than at any time since the 1960s. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=516.72s)]
*  And unions have had this bunch of great successes within the past year. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=521.48s)]
*  UPS workers who are part of the Teamsters, academic workers, tens of thousands of health [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=526.76s)]
*  care workers at Kaiser, airline pilots, the Writers Guild in Hollywood. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=531.64s)]
*  All of these big organized labor successes in the past 12 months. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=536.72s)]
*  And now of course the UAW, United Auto Workers. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=541.44s)]
*  A six week strike against the big three U.S. automakers has brought agreements for what [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=544.44s)]
*  are being called record contracts, a 25% pay raise for auto workers over four and a half [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=549.16s)]
*  years. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=555.28s)]
*  And now the big three work at a Detroit automaker 40 hours a week, $84,000 a year. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=556.28s)]
*  Plus cost of living adjustments guaranteed as a protection against inflation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=562.52s)]
*  Now these are all tentative agreements with the big three automakers. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=568.52s)]
*  UAW locals still have to ratify the results. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=571.56s)]
*  But the terms the union won in this strike are so favorable that when they were announced, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=574.8s)]
*  Toyota, which is an union, unexpectedly announced a surprise increase in its own wages for [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=582.0s)]
*  its own non-union employees, presumably to try to preempt them all wanting to join the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=588.32s)]
*  union now to get the same kind of deal that UAW was just able to get for its members at [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=593.44s)]
*  Ford and GM and Stellantis. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=599.16s)]
*  The UAW strike was audacious. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=602.48s)]
*  It was pushy. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=605.96s)]
*  It was a huge success. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=606.96s)]
*  UAW's President Sean Fain said if the automakers have record profits, which they do, then we [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=610.8399999999999s)]
*  should have record contracts. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=616.16s)]
*  And now they do. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=618.5999999999999s)]
*  Just just watch this. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=621.24s)]
*  You can you can tell from the way they are messaging on this from the very beginning [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=622.68s)]
*  of the strike. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=626.68s)]
*  You can tell that part of the wind in their sails here is that they know the kind of support [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=627.7199999999999s)]
*  they have from the American public. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=632.88s)]
*  We have nothing to fear. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=637.68s)]
*  I look around here. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=641.28s)]
*  I see power. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=643.24s)]
*  I see faith. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=644.84s)]
*  And I see a working class that is fed up and fired up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=647.04s)]
*  I see working class people from all walks of life standing together. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=653.72s)]
*  You all know what we need to do. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=660.0s)]
*  And now the whole world knows what we need to do. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=662.56s)]
*  When they tell us to sit down, we stand up. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=666.2s)]
*  You may have recognized some Democratic politicians in that footage from UAW. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=670.9200000000001s)]
*  Recognizable folks here. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=675.6s)]
*  Senator Sanders here. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  Congressman Dingell, Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  You see there. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=680.48s)]
*  This was all put out before the leader of the Democratic Party, the sitting president [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=681.6s)]
*  of the United States, made history by being the first sitting president in the history [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  of the United States to join union workers on a picket line. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=690.2s)]
*  The first time that's ever happened in American history. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=694.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden made history that way. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=697.0s)]
*  In the midst of this strike, while his likely opponent next year, Donald Trump, instead [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=699.8s)]
*  went out and said that the UAW was selling auto workers down the tubes. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=705.16s)]
*  He said to UAW members, quote, I don't think you're picketing for the right thing. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=710.56s)]
*  He said, members of the UAW should stop paying their dues. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=714.92s)]
*  This was his contribution. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=719.24s)]
*  And then the UAW got record contracts from all three Detroit automakers with massive [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=720.96s)]
*  support from the American people. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=726.2s)]
*  With basically the whole country cheering them on. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=728.44s)]
*  With President Biden making history to step out and support them in a way no president [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  has ever done before. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=735.44s)]
*  And then they won, bigger than anybody thought they could. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=736.76s)]
*  In this supposedly fatally polarized country where we can't agree on anything, the country [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  all basically agrees on this. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=745.8000000000001s)]
*  They did it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Sean Fain, president of the United Auto Workers. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=749.56s)]
*  Mr. Fain, congratulations on the success of these recent labor actions. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=752.88s)]
*  And thanks very much for being with us tonight. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=758.24s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=760.16s)]
*  First off, let me just ask if I've described the strategy here correctly. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=761.16s)]
*  Describing it correctly as an innovation. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  And did I get it right in terms of the way it was designed to sort of calibrate the effect [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=767.84s)]
*  you were looking for? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=771.8s)]
*  You bet. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=773.72s)]
*  You know, basically it was harnessing the power of the membership. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=774.72s)]
*  And, you know, when we – and think about this. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=778.04s)]
*  I've only been in office for seven months. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=780.2399999999999s)]
*  So we had, in a very short order, we had to try to do everything we could do to be prepared [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=781.88s)]
*  for bargaining. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=786.4799999999999s)]
*  We ran for the first time in our history a contract campaign to get our membership prepared [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=788.0s)]
*  so that in the event we had to take action, you know, they would know what the issues [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=792.56s)]
*  were, they would know why they're out there and what we're fighting for. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, the next step was, you know, we did a lot of, for the first time, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=798.68s)]
*  was our transparency and communication with the membership, doing Facebook Lives weekly, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  communicating with the members, keeping them updated on what's going on at the bargaining [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=811.72s)]
*  table and out in other areas. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=815.0s)]
*  You know, seeing our members hold rallies and just do action leading up to this, it [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=817.36s)]
*  gave us immense power at the bargaining table. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  And you know, the company saw we had a unified union, not, you know, in the past there was [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=824.6800000000001s)]
*  always, you know, two sets of people, the membership on the floor and the leadership [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=828.96s)]
*  in Detroit. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=832.96s)]
*  And it's not that way anymore. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=834.48s)]
*  We're one unit. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=835.48s)]
*  We're unified. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=836.48s)]
*  And this is what happens when everyone gets together and they're unified in their approach. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=838.24s)]
*  And we had great success with it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=841.88s)]
*  What do you think about how important it is that there's so much public support right [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=844.1600000000001s)]
*  now for the union movement, for organized labor? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=849.2s)]
*  I mean, over the course of my lifetime, we've seen wild fluctuations in the number of Americans [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=852.48s)]
*  who are in organized labor, who are in unions themselves. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=859.92s)]
*  You know, the UAW at one point was one and a half million people. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=863.8s)]
*  Now it's closer to 400,000. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=866.76s)]
*  We've seen big fluctuations, but we also do see this huge amount of support right now [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=868.88s)]
*  in the public. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=873.36s)]
*  How important was that to the success of these actions and to the way you're thinking about [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=874.36s)]
*  how to keep moving forward? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=879.04s)]
*  Well, I think it's very important. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=880.4799999999999s)]
*  And I think, you know, it's just a sign of the times. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=882.5999999999999s)]
*  In the last 40 years almost, working class people went backwards continually. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=885.68s)]
*  Slowly, it's migrated, and there's this massive chasm between the billionaire class and the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=890.56s)]
*  working class. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=896.0s)]
*  And when those things get out of balance, we need to turn it upside down. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=897.0s)]
*  When 26 billionaires have as much wealth as half of humanity, it's a crisis. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=901.16s)]
*  Our issues, whether it's UAW, it's working class issues. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=909.48s)]
*  Whether you're union or not, everyone identifies with what's going on right now. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=912.72s)]
*  People in unions and people, working class people that aren't in unions, you know, are [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=917.84s)]
*  literally scraping to get by. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=921.5600000000001s)]
*  They're working seven days a week, 12 and 16 hours a day, multiple jobs, not to save [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=922.8000000000001s)]
*  money, just to scrape to get by. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=928.84s)]
*  And so, you know, it's time. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=931.24s)]
*  I think it's way past time. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=932.6s)]
*  And it's up to organized labor to lead that movement. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=935.44s)]
*  And I'm really proud of the work we've done and other unions are doing right now standing [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=937.72s)]
*  up for the working class. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=941.0s)]
*  And we've already seen the fruits of that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=943.56s)]
*  We negotiated record contracts to big three. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=945.56s)]
*  And within a week, you saw Toyota reduce their progression four years for their employees [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=948.68s)]
*  and give them 9% pay increases. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=954.1999999999999s)]
*  We call that the UAW bump. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=955.72s)]
*  And that's what happens. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=958.4399999999999s)]
*  And when those people become members of the UAW, they'll get even more. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  And so that's what this is all about. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=963.72s)]
*  It's about raising all tides. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=964.72s)]
*  Let me ask you about that directly. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=966.72s)]
*  I'd like to say tonight here on television to Tesla, to Honda, Toyota and other non-union [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=969.08s)]
*  car companies that are making cars in the United States. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=974.88s)]
*  As you mentioned, Toyota seems to have given a UAW bump to their non-UAW member, the workers, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=978.32s)]
*  presumably to try to preempt any enthusiasm among Toyota workers to try to get the same [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=985.4s)]
*  deal by joining UAW. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=989.52s)]
*  Do you have anything you'd like to say to those carmakers right now in terms of what's [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=990.52s)]
*  going to happen here next? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=994.32s)]
*  Well, I look at the migration of my grandparents back in the 30s and 40s from the South coming [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=995.6s)]
*  out of the Depression. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1001.28s)]
*  They moved north to union jobs and it changed their lives. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1002.28s)]
*  And we're getting back to setting that standard now. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  And so we've had throughout this process, because of the energy that's around this campaign, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1007.88s)]
*  literally we've had hundreds, daily hundreds of workers from all over the South, all these [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1013.6800000000001s)]
*  non-union companies reach out to us about organizing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1017.76s)]
*  They want a piece of this. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1021.28s)]
*  And that's the comparison I look at with my grandparents' generation, was they saw a better [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1022.72s)]
*  way of life and we set the standard. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1027.08s)]
*  Now we're back to setting the standard again. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1029.14s)]
*  People want to be a part of that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1031.28s)]
*  So we're reaching out to members and we are in the process of planning our next steps [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1032.4s)]
*  for organizing. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1036.96s)]
*  We've revamped our organizing department and we are locked and loaded and we're coming [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1038.72s)]
*  for them. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  Those workers at Tesla, Hyundai, Nissan, anywhere, Toyota, they're no different than us. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1044.1200000000001s)]
*  Working class people, we all have the same issues. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1049.68s)]
*  We want to have a wage where we can have a sustainable life. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1052.46s)]
*  Not just live to work, but work to have a good living. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1056.5s)]
*  And it's too far gone the other way in the past. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1060.7s)]
*  So I really believe we're going to have a lot of success and I believe those members [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1063.78s)]
*  want to join the union. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1067.7s)]
*  I think once they do and they step aside from the fear tactics and the scare tactics these [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1068.7s)]
*  companies will employ upon them, when they see that benefit, there's no going back. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1073.38s)]
*  One last question for you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1079.38s)]
*  I mentioned that the very visible support that you got from President Biden, it's historic [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1080.46s)]
*  for a sitting president to have done that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1084.5s)]
*  Have you had substantive support behind the scenes personally from President Biden and [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1088.42s)]
*  from his administration? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1091.8600000000001s)]
*  And is this likely to lead to a UAW endorsement for President Biden? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1093.66s)]
*  Well, as we've said from the outset, our endorsements are going to be earned, not freely given. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1098.18s)]
*  Our membership right now, the focus right now is on the agreements and that's been our [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1103.98s)]
*  100% laser focus is on our contracts. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1108.02s)]
*  So the membership right now, the focus is getting them all the information they can [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1111.18s)]
*  around the contract and let them make a good, it's up to them to vote in the next few weeks. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1113.9s)]
*  And we'll address politics when it's time to do that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1121.1399999999999s)]
*  I will say this, there's a distinct difference in the two candidates, the two leading candidates. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1123.94s)]
*  For the first time in our history, this country, a president visited the picket line. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1129.94s)]
*  That says a lot. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1134.9s)]
*  The other candidate chose to go to a non-union factory that has nothing to do with the UAW [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1136.42s)]
*  or our members. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1141.9s)]
*  And so there's a distinct difference there. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1142.9s)]
*  And also in the process of working through, there are things we were laughed at and mocked [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1146.42s)]
*  in our demands for saying we're crazy for asking for these things. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1151.5s)]
*  One of those things was the EV battery working, the transition to EV. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1156.98s)]
*  And we did a lot of success with that in this round of bargaining. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1159.66s)]
*  There were Secretary of Labor Julie Hsu and U.S. Trade Ambassador Katherine Tai, Jeanne [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1163.9s)]
*  Sperling. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1169.3400000000001s)]
*  The White House, they worked with us on a lot of this and they worked with the companies [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1170.5s)]
*  also so we could get to this agreement. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1174.5800000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot of work that's been done. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1176.18s)]
*  There's still a lot of work to be done, but we're heading in the right direction. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1178.8600000000001s)]
*  Nobody's laughing now. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1183.42s)]
*  Nobody's scoffing at what you were able to do. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1184.42s)]
*  Sean Fain, President of the United Auto Workers, thank you for your time tonight, sir. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1186.22s)]
*  Congratulations on what you've done so far. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1190.18s)]
*  And I know these ratifications still need to happen. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1193.18s)]
*  Keep us surprised. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1195.7s)]
*  We'd love to have you back, sir. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1196.7s)]
*  Oh, be glad to be back. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1197.7s)]
*  And it's an honor to be here. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1199.3000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1200.5400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYWe66yYLOo&t=1201.5400000000002s)]
