# Blue state governors network to erect firewall against Trump's threat to democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg)
*  So, Donald Trump has been adamant that his plan to put millions of people in camps and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=0.0s)]
*  start deporting whole families, start raiding workplaces, he says that will all start on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=6.24s)]
*  day one at noon as he's being sworn in on Inauguration Day, January 20th. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=11.08s)]
*  If they're really trying to make that happen, you'd have to start preparing well in advance [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=17.28s)]
*  of the inauguration, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=20.32s)]
*  But that means so does the work to stop him from doing that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=22.28s)]
*  Today in federal court, the ACLU filed their first lawsuit seeking more information about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=25.76s)]
*  Trump's plans to deport millions of people from this country once he takes office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=30.8s)]
*  As far as the ACLU is concerned, now is the time to sue. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=34.96s)]
*  Now is the time to try to expose those plans in order to try to stop them from being carried out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=38.56s)]
*  Go time, in other words, is not the moment Trump becomes president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=44.92s)]
*  Go time is now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=48.84s)]
*  In California, Governor Gavin Newsom has called a special session of that state's legislature, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=51.32s)]
*  asking them to appropriate more funding for California's state legal challenges to federal [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  policies in the next Trump term. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=61.88s)]
*  The Democratic governors of Colorado and Illinois, Jared Polis and J.B. Pritzker, they're leading [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  another group called Governors Safeguarding Democracy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=68.56s)]
*  Essentially, it's a network of governors who are agreeing to pool resources and work together [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=71.76s)]
*  to try to oppose the policies of Trump's White House. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=78.12s)]
*  The group's top staffer is Julia Spiegel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=81.6s)]
*  She says that when governors of different states come together, they can become, quote, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=84.52s)]
*  essential force multipliers and firewalls against threats to our democracy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=88.96s)]
*  Joining us now is Julia Spiegel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=94.72s)]
*  She's the founder and CEO of GovAct, which oversees this new governor's Safeguarding [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=96.44s)]
*  Democracy initiative. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=100.8s)]
*  Ms. Spiegel, it's nice to meet you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=102.6s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=103.68s)]
*  Great to meet you. Thanks for having me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=105.36s)]
*  Can you help me and our audience understand some of the practical ideas behind how this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=107.92s)]
*  would work? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=113.2s)]
*  The idea is Governors Safeguarding Democracy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=114.2s)]
*  But what does the group actually plan to do? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=116.6s)]
*  As you noted, Rachel, Governors Safeguarding Democracy was launched by governors Pritzker [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  and Polis last week. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=123.08s)]
*  But also to your earlier point, the work has been ongoing for several weeks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=125.24s)]
*  What the governors are doing in coordination with governors across the country is working [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  together to pool their resources, the best expertise out there, the best staff to make [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=132.72s)]
*  sure that they are prepared for all the possible contingencies, whatever may come, but also [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=138.16s)]
*  to make sure that the state institutions of democracy are delivering for the people in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=142.72s)]
*  the states. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's really the central premise of what Governor Safeguarding Democracy is doing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  And just to note, this isn't a novel or new method. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=151.88s)]
*  It was actually pioneered by Governor Newsom in the aftermath of Dobbs when Roe was revoked [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=154.88s)]
*  by the Supreme Court and Governor Newsom rallied other governors together. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=159.44s)]
*  And a whole host of them have worked collectively for two years now to work across state lines [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=163.24s)]
*  to protect reproductive health care, including doing novel things like stockpiling abortion [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=168.28s)]
*  medication that hadn't been done previously. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=172.12s)]
*  So we've taken that model and are really building it out now around safeguarding various [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=174.28s)]
*  contours of democracy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=178.56s)]
*  You know, Julia, one of the reasons I want to talk to you tonight is because even before [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=181.4s)]
*  this initiative came about, you have talked about the fact that governors have power when [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  they come together. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  And we think of ourselves as either, you know, atomized 50 different states or the United [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  States as one big thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=195.56s)]
*  But you've talked about this idea that governors in smaller groups can be, as you say, both [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=196.56s)]
*  a firewall and a force multiplier. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=201.72s)]
*  Can you talk more about that, about how a dynamic between a small group of governors [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  or maybe a medium sized group of governors can be more effective than any of these governors [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  could be on their own? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  Governors have these extraordinary powers, some of which are very public, like the bully [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  pulpit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=219.0s)]
*  But they also have these other suite of tools like the budget, signing legislation, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=220.0s)]
*  executive authority, agencies that they oversee and run that in and of itself is this wealth [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  of authorities. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  But it's so much more powerful and impactful when those authorities are paired with each [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  other across state lines. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  There are lessons learned, practices that can be adopted from one state to another and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=236.2s)]
*  coordinated strategy that can be undertaken to make the whole so much greater than just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=240.76s)]
*  the sum of its parts. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=244.8s)]
*  So that's really the premise of this work and that governors Polis and Pritzker are [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=245.96s)]
*  leading now in the democracy context, but across a range of offices and are eager to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=249.44s)]
*  work with anyone who is engaged in the work of safeguarding democracy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=253.84s)]
*  And I do want to note, Rachel, this work is critical no matter who sits in the White House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=259.0s)]
*  It's really about nurturing, supporting and protecting the institutions of democracy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Either way, that work was undergoing years ago and it should be undergoing years from [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=267.0s)]
*  now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=270.36s)]
*  Julia Spiegel, founder and CEO of GovAct, here to talk about the new Governor's Safeguarding [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=272.2s)]
*  Democracy Initiative. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=277.0s)]
*  We're going to be watching this closely. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=278.0s)]
*  I'd love to talk with you again as things start to come together, especially before [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=279.56s)]
*  the end of the transition, Julia. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=283.32s)]
*  Thanks for being here tonight. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=284.6s)]
*  It's a deal, Rachel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=285.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYhgrjXbQg&t=286.88s)]
