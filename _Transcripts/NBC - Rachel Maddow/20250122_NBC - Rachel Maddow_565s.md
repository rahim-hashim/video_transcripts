# Full interview: Rachel Maddow talks with the bishop who asked Trump directly to show mercy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8)
*  They may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=0.0s)]
*  are not criminals. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=9.56s)]
*  They pay taxes and are good neighbors. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=12.24s)]
*  They are faithful members of our churches and mosques, synagogues, wadara, and temples. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=26.2s)]
*  that their parents will be taken away. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=31.0s)]
*  That was the Episcopal Bishop of Washington yesterday at the National Cathedral talking [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=34.4s)]
*  directly to the president, directly, eye to eye, about compassion, humility, kindness, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=37.84s)]
*  honesty, honoring the inherent dignity of every person, talking to him about respect, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=46.4s)]
*  about mercy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=52.28s)]
*  This is not his usual bailiwick. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=54.6s)]
*  It is hers, though. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=57.08s)]
*  Joining us now is the right Reverend Mary Ann Edgar, buddy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=59.6s)]
*  She's the Episcopal Bishop of Washington, D.C. Bishop, buddy, I really appreciate you [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=63.0s)]
*  making the time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=65.82s)]
*  I know you have a lot of options where to be, and I appreciate you being here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=66.82s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=70.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=71.64s)]
*  What made you decide to make that appeal the way you did, to ask him for mercy in that way? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=72.92s)]
*  Well, as I was—as you summarized so well, as I was thinking about at the end, toward [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=80.27999999999999s)]
*  the end of my preparation, the pillars of unity, it struck me that I was missing one, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=86.52s)]
*  and that one, that last one, was mercy, to have mercy and compassion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=94.6s)]
*  And rather than state it in sweeping turns, I thought I would acknowledge, to the president, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=100.32s)]
*  that he had come to the highest office of the land, that he had—millions of people [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=105.84s)]
*  had entrusted him with this power. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=112.28s)]
*  And I wanted to make, as you heard, a plea, a request, that he broaden his characterization [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=114.76s)]
*  of the people that are frightened now and are at risk of losing everything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=124.68s)]
*  And I thought that that would be the more respectful way to say it, and also to appeal [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=132.72s)]
*  to not only the president, but to all who might be listening, to appeal to what we know [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=140.84s)]
*  to be true about our immigrant neighbors, who they are, the kind of people that we're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=146.32s)]
*  blessed to be among, and to remember them in our understanding of what it means to be [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=152.92s)]
*  America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=159.84s)]
*  Your opportunity in that moment to minister directly to the president is a very unique [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=161.44s)]
*  moment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=167.84s)]
*  I know that you've been the bishop in Washington for a long time, and you were there for his [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=168.84s)]
*  first inaugural as well. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=174.24s)]
*  But I wanted to ask about the broader question of the role of the church right now in moral [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=176.24s)]
*  leadership in this moment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=184.24s)]
*  We have seen the Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church, elements of the Lutheran Church, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=185.84s)]
*  other congregations all over the country, very diverse types of churches, offer themselves, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=190.64s)]
*  for example, as sanctuaries for people who are facing deportation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=196.04s)]
*  What do you see as the role of the church in helping lead the public and helping us [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=199.64s)]
*  understand what our moral responsibilities are right now? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=205.04s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=208.44s)]
*  I would say the first and primary role that we have is by example, to take the teachings [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=209.44s)]
*  of our faith, to welcome the stranger, to love as we've been loved, to be comfortable [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=215.44s)]
*  to be compassionate and to live that out in in real terms with real people in our communities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=220.04s)]
*  So that's that's foundational. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=226.64s)]
*  And then when given the opportunity to speak, to speak and to be at times a conscience, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=229.44s)]
*  at other times a consolation, to be present ministering or pastoring the common good. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=237.54s)]
*  And so it takes many forms. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  It depends on the moment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  We're in a particularly harsh moment now when it comes to conversations around immigrant [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=248.64s)]
*  populations in our midst. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=255.6s)]
*  And so that was the reason for the for the tone I took now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=257.4s)]
*  But it could have been a very different tone in a different context, depending on depending [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  on how compassion needs to be manifest in a given time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=266.96s)]
*  Even before we had the sort of you wouldn't use these terms, but I'll use it sort of nasty [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=272.68s)]
*  reaction from the president in the overnight hours in which he demanded an apology from [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=278.76000000000005s)]
*  you and insulted you in personal terms. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=284.04s)]
*  Even even before we got that reaction from him, a lot of people were describing what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  you did as brave. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=291.8s)]
*  And I wanted to get your reaction to that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, as a as a high ranking church leader who's been doing this job for a long time, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=295.72s)]
*  I imagine that speaking in public isn't difficult to you and speaking on difficult truths isn't [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=300.04s)]
*  difficult for you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  But what do you make of the fact that I think a lot of people are feeling are seeing in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=305.32s)]
*  you a form of courage that they hope they would have themselves? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=312.04s)]
*  Well, just a slight correction. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=315.32s)]
*  I'm afraid every time I step into a pulpit, right, that really never goes away, large [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=318.32s)]
*  or small. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=323.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=324.48s)]
*  It's a huge responsibility, tremendous vocation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=325.48s)]
*  And how many people get that amount of time and interrupted speech, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=327.96s)]
*  So it's a it's a really big deal. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  And I take it I take it very seriously every time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=334.2s)]
*  So yeah, I was nervous. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=338.32s)]
*  I was scared. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=339.48s)]
*  I think perhaps the reason why it had the effect that it did is because for a while [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=340.76s)]
*  now there has been very little public. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  There hasn't been much of a narrative outside of the narrative that the president has been [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=354.24s)]
*  describing, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=359.2s)]
*  People have gone quiet or they've been ignored. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  And so this was a moment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=365.12s)]
*  And I had no idea who was paying attention. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=366.92s)]
*  I mean, the inauguration was the day before there. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=368.52000000000004s)]
*  There weren't that many people in the cathedral. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  It wasn't crowded. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  It was a group of people who had gathered at his at his invitation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=374.48s)]
*  But it wasn't something that was in the in public discourse. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  And so I think in some ways that was perhaps the reason why it had the effect that it did. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=385.16s)]
*  It is also an audacious thing to address anyone directly in from the pulpit. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  I typically do that for weddings, you know, when you talk to a couple for you know what [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=395.88s)]
*  I mean, for funerals, you talk to the to the family you're seeking to console. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=400.6s)]
*  This was a service of prayer for unity for the country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=404.48s)]
*  But it was on the occasion of the inauguration of a president. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=408.0s)]
*  And if you go back to other sermons in those moments, there's almost always a word to the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  president. So it wasn't unusual in that way. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  But in the particular moment we're in, it it filled a space that hadn't been occupied [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=418.24s)]
*  for a while. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=424.64s)]
*  Bishop, I'd like to ask you one last question, and I'll give you from the outset an [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=426.64s)]
*  opportunity to not answer this if you don't want to, because it's perhaps not fair of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  me. But we did get that nasty gram from the president in the middle of the night in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=435.64s)]
*  which he did insult you and demand an apology. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=441.32s)]
*  And I know I've seen remarks that you made today that you've received a lot of not just [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=444.08s)]
*  invective, but threats, including death threats over the course of today since that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  happened. And I would just ask if you wanted to respond either to the president or to the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=453.28s)]
*  people who have wished you ill in response to this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=459.2s)]
*  Well, I've been I've had people wish me dead. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=462.76s)]
*  I'm not sure they've threatened to kill me, but they seem to be pleased if I met my [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  eternal destiny sooner rather than later. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=470.92s)]
*  And I would simply say I you know, I was trying actually to encourage a different kind of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  conversation that you can certainly disagree with me. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  You can disagree what I've said or did. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  But could we as Americans and fellow children of God speak to one another with respect? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=483.72s)]
*  I would offer the same to you. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  I would I would listen to your views and I would honor them. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=492.16s)]
*  But we can we don't have to go to the highest extremes of contempt when we are in a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=496.0s)]
*  position of disagreement. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=502.28s)]
*  And I think if we could get that back as a country, we would go a long way in being able [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=504.12s)]
*  to work together to the to address the many problems that we face. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=509.32s)]
*  Well, at its best, no matter your religious faith or lack thereof, the ministry is both [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=513.92s)]
*  teaching and leading. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=521.56s)]
*  And that, I think, is why you're having such a strong reaction from so many Americans to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=523.84s)]
*  what you did yesterday. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  And I am sorry for the vitriol and the negative reaction that you've had from some quarters. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsKZA0bBNu8&t=529.28s)]
