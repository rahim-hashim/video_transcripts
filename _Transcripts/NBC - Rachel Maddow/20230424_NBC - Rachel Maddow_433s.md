# Tucker Carlson's fall marks another step in declining power of right-wing figureheads
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak)
*  He was one of the best-known people in the country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=0.0s)]
*  He was on hundreds of radio stations [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=6.0s)]
*  at a time when radio stations were all we had. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=8.0s)]
*  The best estimates are that he, around 1936, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=10.5s)]
*  around this time, he had tens of millions of Americans [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=14.5s)]
*  listening to him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=18.0s)]
*  Again, this was a time when the country had a population [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=20.0s)]
*  of less than 130 million people, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=22.5s)]
*  but he had 30 million people listening to him every week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=25.0s)]
*  His name was Father Charles Coughlin, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=29.0s)]
*  and while he just became a bigger and bigger and bigger deal on the radio, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=31.0s)]
*  and he got more and more political, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=37.0s)]
*  and more and more radically right-wing in his political broadcasts, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=39.0s)]
*  you know, sometimes his views allied with the views [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=43.0s)]
*  in the interest of the Catholic Church, sometimes they didn't, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=46.0s)]
*  because he was such a big deal in the media. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=49.0s)]
*  You know, both Coughlin and the Church were well aware [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=53.0s)]
*  that with the possible exception of the Pope himself, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=56.0s)]
*  and that's arguable, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=58.0s)]
*  Charles Coughlin was the most influential Catholic on earth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=60.0s)]
*  So even though he was really, really controversial [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=63.0s)]
*  and getting more so all the time, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=66.0s)]
*  the Church gave him a wide berth. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=68.0s)]
*  Until they didn't. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=71.0s)]
*  He was a Catholic priest, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=73.0s)]
*  and he had had this bishop who came up with excuses [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=75.0s)]
*  for everything he said and covered for him and protected him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=78.0s)]
*  His bishop died. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=80.0s)]
*  Coughlin had a new bishop who came in, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=82.0s)]
*  and the new bishop thought Coughlin was way too much of a headache [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=84.0s)]
*  for the Catholic Church, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=86.0s)]
*  and so they pulled the plug on him, took him off the radio, gone. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=88.0s)]
*  Poof. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=90.0s)]
*  But the next closest sort of long shadow of that guy's influence [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=92.0s)]
*  was this guy, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=97.0s)]
*  who in the late 1980s started an AM radio career [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=99.0s)]
*  that changed AM radio. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=102.0s)]
*  It turned what had been a mix of sports broadcasts [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=105.0s)]
*  and religious services and kind of community service, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=107.0s)]
*  community access, sometimes even foreign language broadcasting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=110.0s)]
*  It turned all of that into a part of the American media [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=113.0s)]
*  that was just dominated by hardline right-wing talk radio. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=117.0s)]
*  He went to dozens and then hundreds of stations nationwide very quickly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=122.0s)]
*  He got himself literally a golden microphone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=129.0s)]
*  Like, you know, there's a certain kind of world leader [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=133.0s)]
*  who likes to show off that he's got a gun made out of gold. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=136.0s)]
*  This guy had a gold microphone that he made sure was in all his photos. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=139.0s)]
*  He's very proud of it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=142.0s)]
*  It was hugely successful. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=144.0s)]
*  He changed the whole purpose of that part of American media. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=146.0s)]
*  He spawned a thousand, if not thousands, of radio imitators [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=149.0s)]
*  that your angry great uncle probably still listens to today, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=154.0s)]
*  provided that he still has a terrestrial radio. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=157.0s)]
*  You know, at his height, he really seemed like his potential was limitless, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=161.0s)]
*  like his influence would just keep growing and growing and growing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=165.0s)]
*  until it didn't. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=169.0s)]
*  Then after him, there was this guy who also built a fast-growing audience [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=171.0s)]
*  on right-wing AM talk radio. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=176.0s)]
*  And then he was brought onto television, and he did well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=178.0s)]
*  He was brought onto the Fox News Channel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=181.0s)]
*  And he got huge ratings at the Fox News Channel [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=183.0s)]
*  with his sort of signature elaborate conspiracy theories [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=187.0s)]
*  that he would draw out on a chalkboard. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=191.0s)]
*  But at the Fox News Channel, he was their fastest-growing star, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=193.0s)]
*  which they must have been very happy with at Fox News [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=196.0s)]
*  until they weren't. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=200.0s)]
*  He was fired, and now he has a website. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=203.0s)]
*  At the time slot he used to be on, which again, he set ratings records [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=208.0s)]
*  at this weird time slot he was on. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=213.0s)]
*  After he left, they filled that time slot with an ensemble show [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=215.0s)]
*  that turns out also does great in the ratings without him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=219.0s)]
*  And they don't have anybody whose name you'd know off the top of your head at all. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=222.0s)]
*  Then it was this guy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=227.0s)]
*  This guy actually was the biggest host that Fox ever had [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=228.0s)]
*  in their marquee primetime spot. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=232.0s)]
*  He was the most dominant voice in right-wing television ever. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=234.0s)]
*  Until he wasn't. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=239.0s)]
*  He too fired in 2017, in his case. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=242.0s)]
*  And now he does like YouTube videos, I think, from his home. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=245.0s)]
*  Now there's this guy, their latest biggest thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=250.0s)]
*  And he's out today as well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=255.0s)]
*  He's been fired. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=258.0s)]
*  I think it's easier when you look at them as a group [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=260.0s)]
*  to get to what matters about them for the country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=262.0s)]
*  Because what you get if you squint at this series of guys [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=266.0s)]
*  who are dominant for their time, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=270.0s)]
*  well, what you realize over time is that as time has gone forward, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=274.0s)]
*  if you look at this over a 90-year spread of time, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=278.0s)]
*  you see that over time, whoever the dominant figure is in right-wing radio [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=283.0s)]
*  or right-wing media, the right-wing media industry, whatever it is, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=287.0s)]
*  whoever is dominant for their time gets smaller and smaller and smaller over time. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=291.0s)]
*  And don't get me wrong, there is a constancy here. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=299.0s)]
*  You get unnervingly similar messaging from these guys [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=301.0s)]
*  over the decades and over the generations. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=304.0s)]
*  They all say some version of, trust no one except, of course, me, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=306.0s)]
*  because I'll give it to you straight and nobody else will. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=310.0s)]
*  They also tend to say, I know what God wants, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=313.0s)]
*  and obviously what God wants is what I want, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=315.0s)]
*  and I therefore can tell you who's evil and must be eliminated. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=317.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a constancy in terms of the way they perform. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=320.0s)]
*  They all sing a version of that same song. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=323.0s)]
*  You are right to see commonalities among them in style [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=325.0s)]
*  and in terms of the kind of appeal they have, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=328.0s)]
*  the kind of thing they're selling, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=331.0s)]
*  the way they try to get Americans to hate each other and resent each other, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=333.0s)]
*  and particularly the way they try to get Americans to hate minority groups. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=336.0s)]
*  But I also think it can be overstated, right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=340.0s)]
*  Even though there's always one of them who is dominant, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=346.0s)]
*  the magnitude of their dominance decreases over time. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=349.0s)]
*  And you can see that when you look at who's been the dominant figure [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=354.0s)]
*  in decade after decade, generation after generation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=357.0s)]
*  As big as any of these modern guys are, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=360.0s)]
*  there's never ever going to be anyone as dominant [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=362.0s)]
*  as Father Charles Coughlin was in the 1930s. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=366.0s)]
*  And as big as the broadcasters were, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=370.0s)]
*  you know, in the 80s and 90s, they'll never compete with Coughlin. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=373.0s)]
*  And the broadcasters who were huge in the 80s and 90s, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=377.0s)]
*  they were more dominant in their time [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=379.0s)]
*  than any of the flavor of the month broadcasters are dominant now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=381.0s)]
*  So we have a dominant figure. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=386.0s)]
*  Almost always there's somebody who's dominating. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=388.0s)]
*  But the magnitude of their dominance, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=391.0s)]
*  their overall importance to the right-wing media ecosystem, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=393.0s)]
*  it just shrinks as right-wing media over time diversifies [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=397.0s)]
*  and becomes a lot of different things [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=402.0s)]
*  and something that exists on a lot of different platforms. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=404.0s)]
*  So there'll never be somebody as big as the biggest guys of the past were. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKYwBYy-Cak&t=408.0s)]
