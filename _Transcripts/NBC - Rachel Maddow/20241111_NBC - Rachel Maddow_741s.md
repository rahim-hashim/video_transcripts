# Trump cabinet picks point to continuation of first term's scandals and disgrace
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q)
*  So the last time that Donald Trump was president of the United States, his secretary of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=0.0s)]
*  interior got embroiled in a corruption scandal and was referred to the U.S. Department of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=4.9s)]
*  Justice for potential criminal prosecution. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=10.8s)]
*  The last time Donald Trump was president, his secretary of transportation also got embroiled [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=14.58s)]
*  in a corruption scandal and was referred to the Department of Justice for potential criminal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=20.2s)]
*  prosecution. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=25.2s)]
*  The last time Donald Trump was president, his secretary of labor got embroiled in a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  disgusting scandal involving convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=31.52s)]
*  A federal judge ruled that Trump's labor secretary had broken the law in that scandal, and so [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=36.44s)]
*  the labor secretary was referred to the Office of Professional Responsibility at the Justice [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=42.12s)]
*  Department. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=46.32s)]
*  He ended up resigning in... [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=47.32s)]
*  He ended up resigning in disgrace. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=50.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's secretary of energy resigned in a corruption and ethics scandal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=54.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's head of the EPA resigned in a corruption and ethics scandal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=59.36s)]
*  Donald Trump's health and human services secretary resigned in a corruption and ethics scandal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=63.84s)]
*  And I mean, any one of these cases is like a teapot dome sized scandal, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=70.84s)]
*  It used to be if you had one cabinet official involved in a big ethics and or corruption [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=77.12s)]
*  scandal that forced them out of the job or led them to, you know, to being referred for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=82.0s)]
*  criminal prosecution, even if you just had one, that would be enough to brand your whole [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=87.88s)]
*  presidency a disgraced and scandal ridden mistake. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=92.8s)]
*  I mean, Warren G. Harding, what is remembered about the Warren G. Harding presidency? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=99.72s)]
*  I mean, maybe you got three things you could remember. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=105.52s)]
*  A, died in office. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=108.76s)]
*  B, had an affair. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=110.8s)]
*  C, teapot dome scandal, corruption scandal, which resulted in a cabinet official being [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  criminally charged. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=116.8s)]
*  I mean, literally a century after that one scandal involving one cabinet official. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=117.8s)]
*  That's basically all we remember about that guy's presidency, because admit it, when I [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=124.12s)]
*  just said Warren G. Harding had an affair, you went, he did? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=128.04s)]
*  You didn't even know that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=131.4s)]
*  We only remember that one scandal because it led to a cabinet official getting in trouble. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=132.64s)]
*  One cabinet official getting in trouble in that kind of a corruption scandal used to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=139.56s)]
*  be enough to mar your presidency and brand it alone for a century. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=143.52s)]
*  The first Donald Trump presidential term had so many cabinet officials forced out of office [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=150.84s)]
*  in disgrace and referred to the Justice Department to face criminal charges, it's actually hard [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=157.24s)]
*  to remember them all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=163.04s)]
*  And of course, just one of the scandals of the Trump administration is that despite an [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=165.96s)]
*  unprecedented number of cabinet officials being referred to the Justice Department for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  potential prosecution, the supposedly independent Department of Justice under Donald Trump decided [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=176.16s)]
*  to bring charges, to actually bring criminal charges against precisely none of them, which [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=181.28s)]
*  is yet another of the Trump scandals from his first term. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=187.08s)]
*  But still. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  I will also mention that one of the more memorable disasters, ethical disasters along these lines [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=192.2s)]
*  from the first Trump term, was his secretary of Veterans Affairs. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=197.92s)]
*  And this one might be the most memorable because it happened right at the end. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  I remember the headline about it on our show blog. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  Our headline about it was December 10th, 2020. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  This is after Trump lost reelection to Joe Biden, but before the January 6th attack on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=212.83999999999997s)]
*  Congress, before the inauguration, it was December 10th, 2020. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=217.6s)]
*  This was the headline. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=220.84s)]
*  Yet another Trump cabinet secretary caught up in scandal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=221.84s)]
*  As Donald Trump's presidency comes to an ignominious end, it's apparently not too late for one [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=225.12s)]
*  more cabinet controversy. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=230.56s)]
*  And that last one, it was the secretary of Veterans Affairs. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=234.12s)]
*  And he too, like so many of his colleagues in the Trump cabinet, he too was referred [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=237.28s)]
*  to the Justice Department for potential prosecution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=242.04s)]
*  An investigation happened in declaims that he had tried to discredit a veteran who said [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=245.84s)]
*  she had been sexually assaulted at a VA facility. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=251.28s)]
*  The VA inspector general investigated those allegations, found evidence that he seemed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=254.6s)]
*  to have broken the law. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=258.82s)]
*  They referred him to DOJ to be prosecuted. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=261.04s)]
*  And of course, the Trump Justice Department did not prosecute him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  They didn't prosecute any of these guys. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=268.04s)]
*  One of the things that was really memorable about his scandal is that more than 20 different [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=271.68s)]
*  veterans groups rose up in outrage against that guy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=276.76s)]
*  And these were disparate veterans groups, with very different takes on the world. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=280.34s)]
*  Everybody from the American Legion to Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans of America, to the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=284.12s)]
*  veterans of foreign wars, they all demand that this VA secretary resign or be fired. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=288.44s)]
*  Even a really, really conservative pro-Trump veterans group just railed against this guy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=294.76s)]
*  But then he was embroiled. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  It was just a disaster. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=302.8s)]
*  I mean, it was a sign that even right up to the very bitter and ultimately very violent [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=304.2s)]
*  end of Trump's term in office, things were just bad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=310.08s)]
*  It was a bad presidential term. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=315.44s)]
*  It is not normal to have a half dozen members of the cabinet referred for potential criminal [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=317.76s)]
*  prosecution for crimes they allegedly committed while they were serving in the cabinet. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not normal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=329.44s)]
*  I mean, that's the kind of thing that gets you listed repeatedly as the worst or among [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=330.44s)]
*  the worst ever presidents in U.S. history when presidential historians and scholars [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=335.76s)]
*  are surveyed about these things. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=339.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=340.88s)]
*  This is why Trump is considered by experts in the field to be, if not the worst, then [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=341.88s)]
*  certainly one of the worst presidents in the history of the United States. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=347.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, Warren G. Harding. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=351.8s)]
*  It just wasn't good. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=353.36s)]
*  Today is Veterans Day. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=355.56s)]
*  Happy Veterans Day. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=357.84s)]
*  Veterans Day is a celebratory day. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=358.84s)]
*  It's not to be confused with Memorial Day, which is a very somber occasion. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=360.52s)]
*  Memorial Day, we remember service members who gave their lives for our country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=364.84s)]
*  Veterans Day is a happy day. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  It is a celebration of our nation's veterans, a time to say thank you and to just pay them [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=372.16s)]
*  some attention, pay some attention to their service and their pride in their service. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=376.64s)]
*  Basically, as a country, Veterans Day is a day to lift up our service members and our [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=382.12s)]
*  veterans. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=386.12s)]
*  And I therefore try not to do bummer veterans news on Veterans Day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=387.12s)]
*  But today, the news is that Donald Trump, for his second presidential term, has brought [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=393.12s)]
*  back that guy, that last cabinet official with the last scandal, the guy who was referred [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=401.12s)]
*  for criminal prosecution right at the end of Trump's first term in office after a scandal-ridden [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=408.12s)]
*  tenure at the VA. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=413.12s)]
*  And this time, Trump has brought that guy back to lead Trump transition efforts for [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=416.12s)]
*  the entire military, for the entire Defense Department. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=422.12s)]
*  Former VA secretary who was referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=427.12s)]
*  at the end of his term to lead Trump's Pentagon transition efforts at a time when the United [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=432.12s)]
*  States of America is looking to the U.S. military for assurances that they won't deploy against [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=438.12s)]
*  American civilians the way Trump has threatened he will order them to do. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=445.12s)]
*  The guy who's in charge with staffing up the Defense Department leadership for the military, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=451.12s)]
*  making sure we've got all the best, most ethical people there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=455.12s)]
*  It's the guy who left office last time under Trump while his, quote, possible criminal [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=460.12s)]
*  conduct was under investigation by federal prosecutors. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=464.12s)]
*  Good times. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=468.12s)]
*  There's been a flurry of announcements and news about Trump staffing up for his second [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=472.12s)]
*  term in the past 24 hours. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=477.12s)]
*  He really is bringing back that guy to choose the staff and leadership of the U.S. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=479.12s)]
*  Defense Department. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=484.12s)]
*  It's just been reported by the New York Times that Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=486.12s)]
*  who once memorably cast aspersions on the size of Donald Trump's genitals in a presidential [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=492.12s)]
*  debate, the New York Times is first to report that Senator Marco Rubio will be Donald Trump's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=497.12s)]
*  choice for secretary of state. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=502.12s)]
*  NBC News has actually just confirmed that news as well, just in the last couple of moments. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=505.12s)]
*  It is on the front page of the New York Times as we speak. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=509.12s)]
*  Marco Rubio, the expected choice by Donald Trump to be his secretary of state. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=512.12s)]
*  We did learn for sure this evening that Trump is choosing for his national security adviser, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=518.12s)]
*  another Republican member of Congress, Congressman Mike Walz of Florida. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=523.12s)]
*  After Congressman Walz helped in the effort to try to overthrow the U.S. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=528.12s)]
*  government and keep Trump in power after he lost reelection in 2020, you might remember, this was [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=532.12s)]
*  an amazing Florida story. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=538.12s)]
*  You might remember a very unusual apology being published by Congressman Walz's hometown [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=540.12s)]
*  paper, the Orlando Sentinel. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=546.12s)]
*  It was an apology to their readers for having endorsed Mike Walz for reelection. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=548.12s)]
*  They apologized for having endorsed him after he tried to help Trump overthrow the government. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=555.12s)]
*  Mike Walz has also distinguished himself by claiming that Trump was not responsible for [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=561.12s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=566.12s)]
*  He also has proposed that Dulles Airport should be renamed Trump Airport. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=568.12s)]
*  So clearly, Congressman Mike Walz has checked all the boxes that he needs to to be national security [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=574.12s)]
*  adviser in the second Trump presidential term. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=580.12s)]
*  Today, we also learned that Tom Homan will be in a job that Trump is apparently calling border czar. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=584.12s)]
*  Remember when Republicans used to maintain with a straight face that it was a huge scandal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=590.12s)]
*  It was evidence of communism to call anybody the czar of anything in the U.S. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=595.12s)]
*  government. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=600.12s)]
*  Well, Tom Homan will be Trump's border czar. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=602.12s)]
*  Tom Homan is the architect of the policy that had the U.S. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=605.12s)]
*  government deliberately and systematically taking little kids away from their parents and not [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=609.12s)]
*  giving them back. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=615.12s)]
*  He also spent this interregnum period while Trump's been out of office, barnstorming the country, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=617.12s)]
*  bragging about how he's going to be the man who will mercilessly come after immigrants if and when Trump gets [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=623.12s)]
*  back into power. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=629.12s)]
*  Is there a way to carry out mass deportation without separating families? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=631.12s)]
*  Of course there is. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=637.12s)]
*  Families can be deported together. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=639.12s)]
*  They ain't seen s*** yet. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=641.12s)]
*  Wait till 2025. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=643.12s)]
*  Trump comes back in January. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=644.12s)]
*  I'll be on his heels coming back. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=646.12s)]
*  And I will run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=648.12s)]
*  I'm sick and tired of hearing about the family separation. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=651.12s)]
*  And I'm still being sued over that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=653.12s)]
*  So come get me. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=655.12s)]
*  I don't give a s***, right? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=657.12s)]
*  I don't give a s*** what anybody says. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=659.12s)]
*  Trump comes back. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=661.12s)]
*  I come back. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=663.12s)]
*  And I will run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=665.12s)]
*  That last appearance there, it's worth pointing out, was Tom Homan, again, just appointed to be [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=675.12s)]
*  Trump's border czar for the second term. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=680.12s)]
*  That was him speaking this year at an event called the Rod of Iron Festival, which was a quasi [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=682.12s)]
*  religious event held by sort of a cult group. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=688.12s)]
*  This is their leader. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=694.12s)]
*  This is a group that literally, literally worships assault rifles. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=696.12s)]
*  And they're sort of demigod leader who literally wears a crown that is made out of bullets. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=700.12s)]
*  That cult event is the kind of event that Tom Homan has been speaking at this year, talking about [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=707.12s)]
*  mass deportations and how he'll run all of that when Trump's back in office. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=715.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNgNRLa182Q&t=737.12s)]
