# Women's Health Care Providers Find Innovative Ways To Help Evade Red State Abortion Bans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k)
*  A couple of weeks ago here, just after the Supreme Court overturned the right to an abortion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=0.0s)]
*  in this country, we talked here on this show about one of the ways that abortion providers [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=5.2s)]
*  are trying to keep abortion services accessible to Americans who now live in states where [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=8.98s)]
*  abortion is banned. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=14.16s)]
*  We talked about mobile abortion clinics. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=15.6s)]
*  An abortion access group called Just the Pill announced that they'd be launching a fleet [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=18.56s)]
*  of mobile clinics to park just over the border from states with abortion bans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=24.4s)]
*  And from those mobile clinics, they'd have providers do consultations for medication [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=30.2s)]
*  abortions and dispensing pills, as well as providing surgical abortions for patients [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  who need that or prefer that or who were too far along in their pregnancy for a medication [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=38.839999999999996s)]
*  abortion. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Just the Pill tells us tonight that they have now deployed their first medication abortion [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=44.64s)]
*  in a pilot program. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=50.2s)]
*  A second larger mobile clinic providing that and also surgical abortions will deploy later [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=52.6s)]
*  this summer. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Just the Pill's medical director tells ABC News that the vans are both completely unmarked [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=59.96s)]
*  and bulletproof. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=65.4s)]
*  These vehicles, these mobile clinics, thus equipped, take about eight months to build. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=68.0s)]
*  That's the main thing slowing their expansion to other states so far, but that's what they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  planning to do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  So that's one on-the-ground response to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=77.68s)]
*  Put abortion clinics on wheels and drive them to state borders to be as close as possible [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  to women in these states where abortion is now banned. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=85.68s)]
*  But now there's another doctor who looked at a map and realized that for women in certain [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  places like the Deep South and South Texas, there is a place that is much closer than [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=94.56s)]
*  the nearest state where abortion could still be legal. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=99.34s)]
*  And that nearest place would be the sea, the ocean, the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=103.44s)]
*  Dr. Meg Autry is an OBGYN and professor at the University of California at San Francisco. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=109.88s)]
*  She plans to launch a floating abortion and reproductive health care clinic in federal [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=115.6s)]
*  waters in the Gulf of Mexico, a few miles off the coast and therefore a few miles out [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  of reach of repressive state laws. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=125.02s)]
*  The idea is that for many women in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, it might [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=128.36s)]
*  be closer and easier and cheaper to get to a boat, to get to a floating clinic a few [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=132.9s)]
*  miles off the coast rather than trying to fly or drive to the nearest state where abortion [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=139.0s)]
*  is legal. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=143.52s)]
*  Now, this project is still in the fundraising stage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=144.52s)]
*  For starters, Dr. Autry needs a boat to be able to make this happen. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=146.8s)]
*  But as sort of high in the sky and crazy as this idea might sound at first blush, there [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  is really salient and extensive experience of doing this sort of thing for women who [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=156.64s)]
*  are seeking abortions. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago, we spoke here on this show with Dr. Rebecca Gompertz, a Dutch doctor [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  who has spent decades figuring out innovative ways to get abortion services to women in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=168.04s)]
*  countries where abortion is illegal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=172.26s)]
*  Her organization, Women on Waves, has spent years providing abortions on ships floating [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=174.24s)]
*  in international waters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=179.24s)]
*  And the work that Dr. Gompertz has been doing globally, figuring out how to get women abortion [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=181.32s)]
*  services where their countries have made it illegal, well, that is now work that needs [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  to be done here inside the United States as well, figuring out how to get abortion services [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=190.48s)]
*  to women in states where it is illegal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=195.04s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Meg Autry. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=199.2s)]
*  She's a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Autry, I really appreciate you making time to be with us tonight. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=207.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=208.04s)]
*  Am I explaining this, the basics of it correctly? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=210.48s)]
*  And is there any important nuance here that I'm missing in terms of conveying this to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=213.2s)]
*  our audience? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=216.2s)]
*  No, I think you pretty much got it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=217.2s)]
*  It is, I think one of the really important things to remember is that wealthy individuals [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=220.92s)]
*  in our country will be able to get the care that they want and how they want it whenever [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  and wherever they want it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=231.72s)]
*  And this is serving a portion of our population that in these restricted states that are potentially [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=233.12s)]
*  unable to access those resources. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  How daunting are the logistics of what you are proposing, what you're trying to do? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=244.6s)]
*  I mean, obviously there's the matter of acquiring a boat and getting it properly equipped and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=249.56s)]
*  staffed and all that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=253.72s)]
*  But it just, it seems to me as somebody totally ignorant as to how something like this would [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=254.72s)]
*  work that there's also the very serious challenge of how you get women out to the facility that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  you're going to have to have several miles offshore, how you handle follow up care and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=265.7s)]
*  things like that to the extent that that's needed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk to us a little bit about what is most daunting and what feels most doable [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=273.26s)]
*  about those logistics? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=278.38s)]
*  So the most daunting part is all aspects of this are incredibly daunting. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=281.74s)]
*  And so although we're just going public, we've done an extensive amount of research and detail [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=286.82s)]
*  looking at this option and and what seems to be the best way to go about it, both logistically [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=293.18s)]
*  from a security standpoint, from a legal standpoint. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  What is most doable is we have we know that the majority of our country doesn't believe [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=303.74s)]
*  in what is happening and that we we must have bodily autonomy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=309.85999999999996s)]
*  And because of that, we have an amazing amount of incredible people that you've already talked [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=316.38s)]
*  to about in your show that are determined to improve or create access for individuals [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=321.82s)]
*  who don't have it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=327.9s)]
*  Is this plan, is this project based at all off the kinds of similar work that has happened [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  internationally? We had Dr. Rebecca Gompertz here on the show talking about her international [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  experience doing this for women in other countries where abortion has been illegal. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=340.5s)]
*  Have you is this consciously based on that? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  Are you informed at all by her experience during this in other countries? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=346.78s)]
*  So I came up with the idea completely separately, but was quickly alerted to Dr. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=350.38s)]
*  Gompertz efforts and have spoken to her. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=356.66s)]
*  So it's a little bit different. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=358.74s)]
*  She, as you know, had women on waves, which was on international waters off the coast of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=361.06s)]
*  Ireland. And my understanding focused mostly on medical abortions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=366.34000000000003s)]
*  And so this is federal waters in the U.S. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=372.1s)]
*  And different legal and different security issues, but very similar. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=375.3s)]
*  And she was she's a visionary, a pioneer, and she was incredibly helpful in giving me [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=380.98s)]
*  advice going forward. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=387.26s)]
*  Dr. Meg Autry, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=389.86s)]
*  This is obviously an intriguing extreme and also extremely necessary idea. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  I think it's caught a lot of people's imagination because it is such it's so mind blowing that this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  is the sort of thing that might be needed. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=405.70000000000005s)]
*  But you're working to do it practically. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=407.74s)]
*  We'd be interested in hearing from you as you start putting together both the funds and the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=409.06s)]
*  logistics to make it happen. Please come back. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=412.66s)]
*  Thank you very much. All right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=415.42s)]
*  Thanks for your time tonight. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA3q01gxt_k&t=416.74s)]
