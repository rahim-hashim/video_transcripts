# Republicans Credulously Present Convicted Fraudster To Spin Stolen Election Tale
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8)
*  Gelatin. Gelatin. Gelatin is the jiggly wiggly stuff that makes your Jell-O and your gummy candy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=0.0s)]
*  Goes in a whole lot of other foods and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=7.0s)]
*  It's in a lot of stuff. It's big business and most of it is made from animal products. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=11.5s)]
*  So about 15 years ago, a guy from Wisconsin went down to Mississippi with a plan to make gelatin out of catfish waste. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=17.5s)]
*  All the stuff that's left over from catfish processing. The stuff that would just typically be thrown away. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=25.0s)]
*  This guy and his business partner brought in all these potential investors and told them this business plan was a sure bet. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=30.5s)]
*  There was nothing they didn't know about making gelatin out of catfish waste. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=39.0s)]
*  The gelatin was perfected and ready to be sold. They already had a $3 million contract set up with a buyer for it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=44.0s)]
*  Sounded great. Investors handed over hundreds of thousands of dollars to the project. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=52.0s)]
*  The state of Mississippi also gave them hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=57.0s)]
*  They also got a loan from a bank. And for a while things seemed to be going well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=62.0s)]
*  At least as far as the investors knew. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=68.0s)]
*  The guy running the gelatin from catfish waste company was sending them emails and letters telling them how well things were going. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=70.0s)]
*  Telling them the company, quote, is producing product, shipping and invoicing customers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=78.0s)]
*  We have contracted orders from two large customers totaling 3,000 metric tons per year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=84.0s)]
*  We've completely sold out of gelatin at a good price, end quote. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=92.0s)]
*  The U.S. Navy is interested in our amazing catfish waste into gelatin process. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=97.0s)]
*  Oh, and hey, by the way, we've just signed a contract for over a million dollars with a new processor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=102.0s)]
*  Plus, we're going to get 50% of the profits from that new second processing plant. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=107.0s)]
*  But we're just a little short on liquid cash to get over the hump till that second plant is open. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=113.0s)]
*  So if you all could chip in $25,000 more apiece or more if you're feeling generous, that would be great. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=118.0s)]
*  And so the investors kicked in more cash. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=127.0s)]
*  But guess what? And I bet you can probably guess where this is going. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=131.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was no new processor or second plant. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=136.0s)]
*  There were no million dollar contracts. In fact, there was barely even any gelatin. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=140.0s)]
*  There was a whole lot of catfish waste. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=145.0s)]
*  From court documents, they were, quote, never able to manufacture a sellable product, often pouring the results of their attempts in a ditch behind the plant. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=148.0s)]
*  In fact, they were only able to make viable batches of the product a couple of times. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=157.0s)]
*  As a result, the company had no customers and never made any sales. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=161.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=166.0s)]
*  An investor testified that he asked the guy running the company why he did not tell the investors the truth in these letters he was sending out, to which the guy replied, quote, they can't handle the truth. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=168.0s)]
*  Now, I said these were court documents because ultimately federal prosecutors brought multiple felony charges against this guy and his catfish waste to gelatin scheme that built investors and a bank out of their money. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=180.0s)]
*  He always maintained his innocence, but ultimately he was convicted on mail fraud and bank fraud charges, ordered to pay about two million dollars and sentenced to 70 months in prison. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=193.0s)]
*  He was released in 2014. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=203.0s)]
*  But recently he's been peddling a new project. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=207.0s)]
*  This was the headline in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last summer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=212.0s)]
*  A Wisconsin man is scanning ballots and suing a county clerk as he launches his own election review. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=215.0s)]
*  The story that follows is as nutty as the headline sounds. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=223.0s)]
*  To be clear, there is also an investigation launched by Wisconsin Republicans into the 2020 election run by a guy who says the election was stolen and who's hired Trump administration officials as his investigators. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=226.0s)]
*  That investigation is ongoing to the tune of at least many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=239.0s)]
*  But this is not that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=247.0s)]
*  This was just a random guy tooling around making copies of ballots because he decided to run his own private freelance election investigation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=250.0s)]
*  And once the local press cottoned on to what he was doing, it didn't take long for them to realize that the guy wandering the state copying ballots for his own freelance investigation was in fact our friend who went to prison for his catfish waste into gelatin scam. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=260.0s)]
*  And look, this guy has served his time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=276.0s)]
*  He's paid his debt to society, even if as of 2020, he apparently hadn't paid back much of the nearly $2 million that he also owes in restitution. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=279.0s)]
*  And I suppose if he wants to travel the state of Wisconsin making copies of ballots, it's a free country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=289.0s)]
*  And apparently that is something you are free to do in Wisconsin. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=295.0s)]
*  Help yourself. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=298.0s)]
*  But by this December, things had kind of escalated. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=299.0s)]
*  In a December lawsuit, he accused the director of elections in Milwaukee of being part of a quote sect that planned conspired and implemented a massive election fraud by using fake names and fake addresses to cast ballots. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=302.0s)]
*  He claimed that this sect allowed somebody to print ballots for Biden in a back conference room. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=318.0s)]
*  His filing included a hand drawn floor plan of an election office with a spot labeled quote hidden room. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=326.0s)]
*  Someone was sleeping, snoring. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=334.0s)]
*  And now that guy, the catfish waste into gelatin scam, make copies of all the ballots. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=338.0s)]
*  There's a secret sect in a hidden room printing ballots for Biden guy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=343.0s)]
*  That guy, well, he was invited by Republicans to give a presentation to the state's assembly elections committee. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=347.0s)]
*  Someone is using we don't know who someone is using our systems, our databases to cast illegal ballots. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=356.0s)]
*  We have found tens of thousands. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=363.0s)]
*  We don't know who's doing it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=365.0s)]
*  It's probably not the person who's the name. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=367.0s)]
*  It's probably some bad guys. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=371.0s)]
*  Something's wrong. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=373.0s)]
*  Somebody's in there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=374.0s)]
*  Somebody's doing something wrong. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=376.0s)]
*  Casting illegal ballots. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=378.0s)]
*  Somebody's in there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=380.0s)]
*  They're adding names. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=381.0s)]
*  They're adding fake voters. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=382.0s)]
*  They're casting illegal ballots by the tens of thousands. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=385.0s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=388.0s)]
*  And thank you for having me here today. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=390.0s)]
*  They're adding fake voters. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=395.0s)]
*  They're casting illegal ballots by the tens of thousands. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=397.0s)]
*  We don't know who's doing it, but it's bad guys. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=401.0s)]
*  Bad guys are doing it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=403.0s)]
*  And he should know he's got thousands of volunteers and a supercomputer working on this stuff. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=406.0s)]
*  This is what Republicans on the elections committee are doing in Wisconsin right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=411.0s)]
*  I will say there are a couple of Democrats on that committee. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=417.0s)]
*  They tried valiantly to pin this guy down on something. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=420.0s)]
*  He was a bit like gelatin. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=424.0s)]
*  It was tough going. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=425.0s)]
*  You did say that there were people who told you or told your group that they had showed up to vote at the polls and were told that someone had already voted in their name. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=429.0s)]
*  Do you have either for us or for law enforcement affidavits from those people detailing those issues? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=439.0s)]
*  What we do is we encourage those people, many of them are afraid to come forward, but we have found hundreds and hundreds of them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=448.0s)]
*  None of them would sign an affidavit. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=455.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say none, but we don't say if we have 500, maybe a dozen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=457.0s)]
*  I take five. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=464.0s)]
*  I don't have them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=466.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=467.0s)]
*  The poor state assemblyman. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=469.0s)]
*  Do you have any evidence? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=471.0s)]
*  Maybe five people? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=472.0s)]
*  Maybe one person? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=473.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=474.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=475.0s)]
*  You're just going to have to take my word for it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=476.0s)]
*  We also reached out to this gentleman this evening to ask if he could provide us with any evidence. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=478.0s)]
*  He didn't respond to our request for comment. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=482.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuOsJkagpL8&t=487.0s)]
