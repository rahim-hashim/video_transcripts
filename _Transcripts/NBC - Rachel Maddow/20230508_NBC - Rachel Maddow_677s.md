# Radical right wing mass violence sits dangerously close to Republican politics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU)
*  Tonight, NBC News is verifying some of what are basically the worst fears about the apparent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=0.0s)]
*  motivation behind the gun massacre that happened this weekend in Allen, Texas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  And there's so much that is disgusting and unsettling about these latest killings, including [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  sort of what they connect to. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=20.32s)]
*  You might remember it was a year ago this week that a gunman motivated by white supremacist [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=23.56s)]
*  ideology went to Buffalo, went into a supermarket in a black neighborhood in Buffalo and killed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=29.04s)]
*  10 African Americans in that market. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=34.44s)]
*  That was a year ago this week. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=37.32s)]
*  That killer claimed he did that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=40.04s)]
*  He massacred all those people in that supermarket. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=41.84s)]
*  He said he did it because of the great replacement theory, which you can hear all about on the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=44.76s)]
*  Fox News Channel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=49.0s)]
*  He said he did it because of the great replacement theory and because of white genocide, which [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=50.0s)]
*  you can hear all about on right wing talk radio. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=54.72s)]
*  He killed 10 people and injured even more people than that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=58.08s)]
*  He got in February this year, he was sentenced to 11 life sentences. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  That Buffalo attack again was a year ago this week. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Also the connection to Allen, Texas. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Allen, Texas is where this latest massacre was this weekend. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=74.68s)]
*  Allen, Texas is also where the shooter was living from the El Paso massacre. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=77.48s)]
*  Allen, Texas is where the guy started his road trip to that Walmart in El Paso in 2019 [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=83.52s)]
*  where he shot and killed 23 people, almost all of whom were Latino. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Again the killer there ranting that he did it because of the great replacement theory [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=94.32s)]
*  popularized on the Fox News Channel in primetime. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=98.52s)]
*  Well now today in Allen, Texas we're learning more about the apparent motive in killing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=103.28s)]
*  all these people this weekend. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=109.52s)]
*  It is not a subtle thing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=112.24s)]
*  The gunman is believed to have recently posted this photo online. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=116.96s)]
*  This picture and others like it appear to be him, appear to be pictures of himself from [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=125.56s)]
*  You see some of his nice fresh tattoos there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=126.56s)]
*  NBC also reports that he had a long social media record online that included rants against [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=130.68s)]
*  Jews, against women, against racial minorities. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=136.96s)]
*  NBC News also reporting that he posted a bunch of stuff online from white supremacist influencers, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=141.4s)]
*  including the one who recently was apparently invited to Mar-a-Lago to dine with the former [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  president at his South Florida home. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=152.88s)]
*  There have also been reports that the gunman from Allen, Texas this weekend, he had a patch [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=156.16s)]
*  that was velcroed onto the tactical vest he was wearing while he carried out the shooting, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=161.16s)]
*  a patch that had the initials RWDS on it, looks like this one. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=165.28s)]
*  There's a patch of a similar kind shown on the tactical vest of the man who is the leader [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  of the Proud Boys, pro-Trump right-wing paramilitary group. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=177.16s)]
*  Until not that long ago, that Proud Boys leader had a merch store that sold this patch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=181.04s)]
*  RWDS stands for right-wing death squad. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Our leaders of the Proud Boys, the pro-Trump paramilitary group, were of course convicted [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=191.08s)]
*  of seditious conspiracy at the end of last week for their roles in the January 6th attack [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=196.4s)]
*  on Congress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=202.28s)]
*  One of those Proud Boys defendants who was just convicted of sedition, he had not just [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  a patch of the right-wing death squad acronym like the Allen, Texas shooter had, he actually [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=208.08s)]
*  had RWDS, right-wing death squad, tattooed on his arm, which you can see here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=213.96s)]
*  Today, also in federal court in Washington, D.C., we got a fairly heavy sentence handed [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  down against yet another participant in the January 6th attack. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=227.28s)]
*  He's 41 years old. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=231.56s)]
*  He's a former petty officer, first class in the U.S. Navy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  Disturbingly, he reportedly carried top secret and compartmented information security clearances. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=236.28s)]
*  He was already convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison on charges related [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=242.4s)]
*  to him possessing illegal weapons, unregistered silencers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=247.34s)]
*  That was just a few months ago. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=251.66s)]
*  Today, he got an additional four years on his sentence for his participation in the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=252.78s)]
*  January 6th attack. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  And in the FBI affidavit that prosecutors submitted to the court in support of their [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=259.18s)]
*  case, that affidavit spells out his communications with FBI confidential informants, his coworkers [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=263.1s)]
*  and others. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm spelling out and explaining to people why he was at the Capitol on January 6th [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=273.34s)]
*  with, he says, the Proud Boys. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=277.73999999999995s)]
*  That affidavit also explains this man's very clear worldview for what exactly he was doing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=280.61999999999995s)]
*  there that day, what he thought he was there to accomplish. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=286.02s)]
*  From that FBI affidavit, quote, Mr. Speed stormed the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power to President Biden, whom he believed rose [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  to power through election fraud and was, quote, operated by the Jews. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=299.88000000000005s)]
*  Mr. Speed was willing to act corruptly to achieve his goal and stop the certification, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  in part because he felt so passionately that he needed to defend himself and the United [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=310.16s)]
*  States against the country's Jews. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=314.48s)]
*  He did not want the person he saw as a puppet of the Jews to take power. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Speed also thought that more violence was needed on January 6th to pressure Congress [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=322.8s)]
*  to stop the certification, but that that violence did not materialize because Jews [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=327.84s)]
*  had lulled Americans into support for nonviolence. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Speed's deeply held anti-Semitism was a core part of his motive on January 6th. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=337.08s)]
*  He told our undercover informant that he believed that America, a Christian country, was locked [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=342.32s)]
*  in a battle with the Jews. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=347.32s)]
*  That's all this week. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  That's all at once. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  And of course, I didn't even mention, of course, all this is happening while we are in the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=353.92s)]
*  middle of the trial of the white power, great replacement theory, mass murderer from the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=358.04s)]
*  Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=363.08s)]
*  That trial is ongoing right now. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=367.44s)]
*  And of course, all of these things have the same smell, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=369.28s)]
*  They're not just, they don't just happen to be connected in the news right now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=372.2s)]
*  They're connected. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=375.76s)]
*  The Buffalo, white supremacist, mass murder. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=378.4s)]
*  The El Paso, white supremacist, mass murder. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=381.12s)]
*  The Pittsburgh synagogue, white supremacist, mass murder. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=383.64s)]
*  Now it appears the Allen, Texas, white supremacist, mass murder. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=386.88s)]
*  And in a nation recoiling and ashamed and disgusted, there's also these apparent connections, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=391.08s)]
*  right, between this bleeding, ragged, right-wing mass violence and the bleeding, ragged, right-wing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=401.36s)]
*  edge of politics. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=412.72s)]
*  The most mainstream possible electoral Republican politics. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  The most mainstream, most successful right-wing media as well. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  But also this former president and his family and his former officials and the way he is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  currently running for president again. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  They're inviting literal Hitler was right, outspoken anti-Semites, putting stars of David [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  and Jewish stars on the heads of their enemies telling people that's who we need to be going [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=442.4s)]
*  after just the way Hitler. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  They're inviting people like that to their events with the highest ranking former officials [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=449.96s)]
*  of their government. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's all happening while that former president is running for president again. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=455.2s)]
*  And it's happening amid this unrelenting wave of white supremacist motivated mass murder. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  Are those two things separate? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=471.24s)]
*  Are those two things just very disturbing parallel tracks that will never meet and that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  have never met? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=478.64s)]
*  Or is one of these things an anchor for the other? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=480.88s)]
*  Does the fact that both of these things are happening at once in our country, frankly, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=483.36s)]
*  accelerate them both? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=487.76s)]
*  Accelerate the racial radicalism and anti-Semitism as a political tool? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=491.08s)]
*  And also just accelerate the violence in the streets? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=496.2s)]
*  Do they work together? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=500.36s)]
*  And if so, how? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=501.36s)]
*  And if they do work together, how do we stop it? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=503.3s)]
*  Joining us now is someone who has devoted her professional career to the study of just [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=506.92s)]
*  this problem. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=510.24s)]
*  She is Kathleen Ballou. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=511.24s)]
*  She's associate professor of history at Northwestern University. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=512.24s)]
*  She's author of the seminal book, Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement and Paramilitary [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=515.36s)]
*  America. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=520.64s)]
*  Professor Ballou, I really appreciate you making time to be back with us again tonight. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=521.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=525.44s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=526.88s)]
*  So you can probably tell from that right through from that wind up that I am disturbed. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=529.48s)]
*  I'm unnerved at least by these two parallel tracks, by what we see happening with incredible [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=537.08s)]
*  racial and anti-Semitic radicalism adjacent to very mainstream electoral politics and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=545.52s)]
*  the kind of mass violence that we are seeing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=552.12s)]
*  As somebody who's an expert and studies these matters, should we see these things as parallel [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=554.44s)]
*  or are they lines that intersect? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=558.72s)]
*  I don't think we can anymore say that this is adjacent. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=561.6s)]
*  I think that at least the Republican Party insofar as it is represented by Donald Trump [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=565.16s)]
*  has fully embraced many of these elements. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=572.28s)]
*  The fact that this kind of speech is not only sort of waved through with a wink and a nod, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=576.16s)]
*  but invited in. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=583.8s)]
*  And we can see that in the invitation of people like Nick Fuentes to dinner at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=585.68s)]
*  the invitation of Holocaust denial into the main sort of welcome of the candidate. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=591.64s)]
*  And the one that was the most concerning for me as someone who studies this kind of violence [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=598.48s)]
*  was the staging of and the content of the press conference announcing the kickoff of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=602.72s)]
*  this campaign in Waco, Texas. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=608.54s)]
*  Now, many people know about the Branch Davidians siege in Waco as part of sort of a general [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=610.56s)]
*  anti-government sensibility. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  But to people on the far right, to people in neo-Nazi groups, white power groups, militant [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=619.64s)]
*  right groups, it is a call directly to the chain of events that leads to the Oklahoma [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=624.88s)]
*  City bombing, a major act of mass casualty domestic terrorism. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=630.16s)]
*  It is a direct call to that kind of violence. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=636.72s)]
*  It's not just about speech. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=640.76s)]
*  It's direct and bloody. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=642.4200000000001s)]
*  And it has real tolls like we see in Allen and El Paso and Buffalo and Pittsburgh. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=644.2s)]
*  And as more and more and more of these communities are impacted, that toll just grows and grows. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZw9DHff-YU&t=651.34s)]
