# Draft Document Would Have Had Trump Order Seizure Of Voting Machines, Election Equipment
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo)
*  Speaking of Rudy Giuliani, there is news just tonight that thousands of his communications [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=0.0s)]
*  have been turned over to federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating Giuliani's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=4.84s)]
*  dealings in Ukraine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=9.38s)]
*  I know, I know, it's hard to keep up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=10.38s)]
*  All of that doesn't even cover what may have been Donald Trump's biggest loss this week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=12.72s)]
*  The Supreme Court's refusal to block the National Archives from handing over hundreds of pages [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=17.0s)]
*  of Trump's White House records to the January 6th investigation. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=21.38s)]
*  Trump had been fighting it for months, but now those records are being delivered to the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=25.42s)]
*  investigators. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=29.26s)]
*  And oh boy, the first document we have gotten a look at is a doozy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=30.82s)]
*  It is a draft executive order turned over from the files of a White House lawyer that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=36.0s)]
*  would have ordered the defense secretary to seize voting machines. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=41.02s)]
*  This never issued executive order says the defense secretary must seize all the voting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=46.58s)]
*  machines because all the voting machine companies, all of them, were infiltrated by foreign powers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=50.86s)]
*  who changed all the vote totals and made it just seem like Trump lost. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=56.5s)]
*  Which is of course stunning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=61.36s)]
*  But also can I just say at the end of a week in which Republicans have been relentlessly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  hammering Democrats over their voting rights bill calling it a federal takeover of elections, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  here is evidence of Donald Trump apparently considering an actual federal takeover of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=72.66s)]
*  elections and election machines. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=77.16s)]
*  Look, to be clear, a lot of this draft executive order is written in language that does not [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=79.5s)]
*  bear any resemblance to anything like an actual presidential executive order. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=83.98s)]
*  But Betsy Woodruff Swan at Politico points out that the opening of the document cites [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  a number of so-called presidential authorities, including a classified document that has not [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=92.54s)]
*  previously been reported on, which may suggest that someone involved in drafting the document [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=96.98s)]
*  had access to sensitive government information. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  That said, we do not know who drafted it nor how seriously it was considered, though it [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=105.78s)]
*  has been previously reported that some proposal like this was debated in the Oval Office on [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=110.3s)]
*  December the 18th, 2020. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=116.62s)]
*  This document is dated the 16th of December. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=119.36s)]
*  But this is only the first Trump White House record we've seen that has been turned over [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=123.22s)]
*  to the January 6th investigation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=126.9s)]
*  What on earth, what else are they going to turn up? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=129.26s)]
*  . [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWO6yDRBJKo&t=140.3s)]
