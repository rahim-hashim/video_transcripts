# Rep. Crockett calls out budget busting price tag of Trump's anti-immigrant crusade
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4)
*  On his first full day in office, Donald Trump scrapped a longstanding U.S. policy that says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=0.0s)]
*  immigration agents can't enter public schools or health care facilities or houses of worship [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  to go after immigrants. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=13.84s)]
*  Today, people protesting that change rallied at a historic Episcopal church in New York. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, the city council in Ithaca, New York, voted unanimously to bar local law enforcement [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=20.48s)]
*  from cooperating with ICE raids. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=25.86s)]
*  That's despite the Trump administration threatening to prosecute Ithaca public officials who don't [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  cooperate with their crackdown. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=32.7s)]
*  Yesterday, one school superintendent in Alice, Texas, posted a letter alerting parents that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=34.62s)]
*  ICE agents might board school buses to check citizenship of school kids. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=40.46s)]
*  According to information the school board had received, that letter went up yesterday [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=46.7s)]
*  and has since been removed from the school district website. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=50.42s)]
*  From churches to schools to city councils to parking lots, people are pushing back against [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=53.94s)]
*  this administration's attempts to harass and arrest immigrants in their communities. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=58.9s)]
*  Today, Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett was part of a group of lawmakers that introduced [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=62.94s)]
*  legislation to protect immigrants in sensitive locations. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=67.72s)]
*  Congresswoman Crockett says in her district kids are already missing school because parents [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=70.74s)]
*  are afraid of being arrested as they drop their kids off at school. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=74.86s)]
*  She says families are also skipping doctor's appointments and even emergency care that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=78.66s)]
*  they need because they're afraid of being arrested at the hospital. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett joins us live now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=87.14s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's really nice to have you here on the show. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for making time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=91.30000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  What should people understand about the rationale for protecting places like schools, churches, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  synagogues, hospitals from immigration enforcement actions in the past? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=101.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, here, this is very simple. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=107.26s)]
*  First of all, I don't know my country anymore, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=110.61999999999999s)]
*  When we are looking at situations that are so disruptive to our communities and again, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=114.58s)]
*  as you talked about the hero who wasn't necessarily wearing a cape, but instead had her coffee [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  cup, when we think about the disruption to everyone because of something that really [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=124.42s)]
*  is a civil penalty, I want to get this across to your viewers, because I don't think that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  understand that as Republicans oftentimes say things like, oh, they're illegal, they're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=136.0s)]
*  illegal. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=141.96s)]
*  According to federal law, you literally can get a traffic ticket that is more serious [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=142.96s)]
*  than what this is, is a civil penalty. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=150.2s)]
*  And so to have these guys disrupting you as you are trying to pray, whether you're an [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=152.72s)]
*  immigrant or not, you're disrupting a place of worship. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=157.04s)]
*  Or tell me about what type of liability, I mean, even if you don't care about the people [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=161.32s)]
*  themselves, but tell me about the type of liability that we may face if somebody literally [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=165.32s)]
*  is trying to seek care and then you take them away from that care and into our custody, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=169.84s)]
*  right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=175.2s)]
*  Like, it doesn't make sense not to mention the disruption that it causes for everybody [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=176.2s)]
*  else that's seeking care. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=180.0s)]
*  And now we're talking about the kids. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=181.66s)]
*  We're talking about parents not taking their kids to get the education that they need. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=183.72s)]
*  And the kids may be enjoying something that we call birthright citizenship, yet they're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=188.28s)]
*  missing out on school because their parents are too afraid to drop them off. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=192.96s)]
*  And the final point that I'll say is I want people to understand that undocumented folk [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=197.44s)]
*  in this country contribute approximately $100 billion in taxes, and they pay into Social [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=202.32s)]
*  Security that they can't pull down on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=209.32s)]
*  So you tell me how any of this makes sense, because the estimation is that it would cost [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=212.28s)]
*  us approximately $200 billion in the first year to try to effectuate this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=218.68s)]
*  And we know the Republicans are proposing that ICE be given approximately $350 billion. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=224.58s)]
*  And right now, that's causing a lot of consternation within the Republican caucus, and that is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  why we are headed to a shutdown on March 14th, because instead of cutting money, it looks [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=236.44s)]
*  like they are absolutely going to need more money. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=241.84s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=244.76s)]
*  Let me ask you also about the impact. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=245.76s)]
*  As a representative from Texas who's been right in the middle of the culture war over [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=248.44s)]
*  this, but also who represents a very diverse district, it strikes me also that with some [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=253.0s)]
*  of these changes, not just saying we're going to go after people wholesale and not just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=259.36s)]
*  making it into a big propaganda spectacle and inviting celebrities and hand-picked media [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=263.72s)]
*  to go along to make it look like an episode of Cops. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  But in addition to that, by going after saying we want to go after people in schools and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=271.64s)]
*  in places of worship and in health care facilities, the cruelty there and the impact there is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=276.08s)]
*  to really isolate immigrant families or families that have mixed status so that they can't [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=281.84s)]
*  participate in the fabric of culture the way they do right now and in the basic fabric [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  of services that we all avail ourselves of so that they are more isolated, so they are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=292.32s)]
*  more afraid, so they don't feel supported by their fellow Americans and the other people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=297.36s)]
*  who live among them. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=301.6s)]
*  I wonder if you think that is the aim and if so, if there are other things that Americans [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=302.6s)]
*  who are not in immigrant families, people who do not face these same kind of threats, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=307.88000000000005s)]
*  what they can do to kind of bridge that distance. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  I think it's that, but I think it's even deeper than that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=316.44000000000005s)]
*  What we've seen out of this administration is nothing but chaos and confusion. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=319.6s)]
*  That is how they quote unquote lead, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=323.6s)]
*  So here is the deal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=326.48s)]
*  Whether it's legal or whether it's not legal, it has the same effect, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=327.52s)]
*  So he decides, you know what? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=332.78s)]
*  I'm going to make a big spectacle out of getting rid of this executive order and then [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  next thing you know, we're having to file legislation to try to protect. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=338.96s)]
*  But who's keeping up with all of this drama that's happening? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's whatever news headline they saw last or first or whichever [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=345.94s)]
*  one they feel most comfortable with. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=350.64s)]
*  So right now what we have is that they have been able to inflict fear. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=352.68s)]
*  This is why you brought up Texas, and this is going to impact Texas a ton, as well as [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  the rest of the country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  But even when we start to think about the farms that we have in Texas, or we think about [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=363.88s)]
*  the fact that he even tried to do his little tariff war with Mexico, Mexico and Texas, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=368.76000000000005s)]
*  we share a very special relationship for a lot of different reasons. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  But one is because they are our biggest trade partner as well. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=380.2s)]
*  So now we've got all of these farmers that are saying, hey, my farm workers are not showing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=383.0s)]
*  up. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not just the schools, the hospitals and the religious institutions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  It's actually everywhere. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=392.68s)]
*  They are afraid to go to work, and that's only ending up causing more issues for us [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=394.36s)]
*  as Americans. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's what I need people to understand. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=400.38s)]
*  This isn't a matter of, oh, well, that's over there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  This impacts all of us. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=405.58s)]
*  Because again, we are a country of immigrants. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=408.14s)]
*  And the fact that we have so many people that either don't know our history or want to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=409.7s)]
*  ignore our history, or as we know this administration, especially in Black History Month, they want [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=414.14s)]
*  to delete our history. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=419.78s)]
*  The reality is that immigrants have always been what made this country great, not this [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=421.46s)]
*  white supremacy agenda, which is what we are dealing with. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=426.62s)]
*  And this is what they are doing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=430.54s)]
*  They are instilling fear whether you are Black, whether you are brown, whether you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=432.26s)]
*  are someone who just wasn't born here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=436.58s)]
*  It's kind of like the birthright citizenship. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=439.78s)]
*  That is something that we find in our Constitution. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=442.26s)]
*  And he decided, he probably knew that with the stroke of a pen, he couldn't do anything [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=445.38s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=449.84s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=450.84s)]
*  He caused confusion and he caused angst. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=451.84s)]
*  And that is what we're going to see more of. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=453.84s)]
*  Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, anytime you want to come on this show, you just send [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NquC48V4W4&t=457.34s)]
