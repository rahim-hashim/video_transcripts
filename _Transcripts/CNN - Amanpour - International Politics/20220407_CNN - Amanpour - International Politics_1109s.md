*  Jason Stanley, welcome back to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=35.96s)]
*  this program. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=37.66s)]
*  You have written an authoritative [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=38.92s)]
*  book on fascism. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=40.62s)]
*  I want to look a little bit at [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  the type of fascism that maybe [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  is playing out in front of our [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=48.1s)]
*  eyes in the case of Russia's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=49.54s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine, and how [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=51.34s)]
*  that's different from the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=53.8s)]
*  definitions that we might have [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=55.3s)]
*  seen in our textbooks. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=56.54s)]
*  So, Russian fascism, and I think [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=59.34s)]
*  it's just an almost unmistakable [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  species of fascism, it is a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=67.54s)]
*  classic kind of fascism in its [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=70.08s)]
*  colonial aspect. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=73.22s)]
*  So, fascism is typically linked [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=74.68s)]
*  to empire, the desire to restore [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=78.16s)]
*  empire. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=80.92s)]
*  We find fascists, fascist leaders [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=81.76s)]
*  gaining popularity when they can [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=85.36s)]
*  talk about lost empire and tell [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=87.38s)]
*  their citizens that they're going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=90.38s)]
*  to be the leader who's going to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=93.32s)]
*  violently restore their empire [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=94.62s)]
*  and their place in the world. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=97.06s)]
*  So, in that sense, it's a classic [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=98.3s)]
*  kind of fascism. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=100.1s)]
*  And in its violence and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=101.6s)]
*  militarism, it's a classic kind [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=103.3s)]
*  of fascism. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  And in the way that it appeals [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=106.1s)]
*  to anti-LGBT sentiment in a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=108.1s)]
*  number of other ways, it's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=112.18s)]
*  classic fascism. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=113.48s)]
*  But Russia seeks to, as it worked, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=115.16s)]
*  because it cannot dominate the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=119.44s)]
*  world militarily anymore [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  economically. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=122.84s)]
*  It's really not a superpower like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=123.74s)]
*  China or the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=125.3s)]
*  It's really seeking to dominate [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=127.1s)]
*  the world ideologically. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=128.44s)]
*  And what does that mean here? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=130.12s)]
*  What it means is Putin seeks to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=131.82s)]
*  be the leader of the world's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=134.94s)]
*  traditionalists, the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=136.66s)]
*  ethno-nationalists, the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  patriarchal, anti-democratic, in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  the United States, white [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=145.74s)]
*  supremacists. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=146.74s)]
*  He seeks to say, I am going to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=147.74s)]
*  defend traditional values against [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  decadence and weakness. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=152.72s)]
*  And so, in this way, he's going to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=154.96s)]
*  gather all the different [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  ethno-nationalist movements to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=160.46s)]
*  And also, he's going to gather [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=160.96s)]
*  traditionalist members of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=162.96s)]
*  minority groups who might not be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=164.3s)]
*  the most important members of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=169.62s)]
*  And so, this is what led to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=170.32s)]
*  follow a kind of strict ethnic [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=173.02s)]
*  nationalism. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=175.46s)]
*  One of the rationales that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=176.16s)]
*  Vladimir Putin explicitly gave, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=178.66s)]
*  anyway, was that he wanted to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  denazify Ukraine and almost [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=182.74s)]
*  indemnify himself from this idea [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=187.34s)]
*  that he was perpetrating an [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=189.74s)]
*  aggressive act. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=194.58s)]
*  And so, this kind of fascism [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=196.1s)]
*  involves calling what your [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=198.1s)]
*  enemy, calling your enemy what [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=200.1s)]
*  you yourself are. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  What you yourself are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  So, Putin is clearly doing this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  By denazification, Putin means [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=210.28s)]
*  that he's going to go into [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=213.22s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=215.72s)]
*  He's going to take the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=216.72s)]
*  democratic ideology that Ukraine [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=218.92s)]
*  has embraced since the Maidan [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=222.92s)]
*  coup in 2014. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=225.38s)]
*  He's going to remove it from [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=226.38s)]
*  institutions and schools and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=229.38s)]
*  politics. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=232.38s)]
*  He's going to place the leaders [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=233.38s)]
*  on trial and show trials, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=235.38s)]
*  reminiscent of Nuremberg, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=237.38s)]
*  execute or imprison them, and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=239.38s)]
*  replace them with Russian [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=242.38s)]
*  fascist ideologues and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=244.38s)]
*  extinguish completely Ukrainian [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  democratic identity and Ukrainian [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  identity full stop. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  So, what can the democracies [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=254.88s)]
*  that are standing around the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=257.88s)]
*  planet do in the face of this? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=259.88s)]
*  In the absence of a military [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=261.88s)]
*  intervention, we obviously have [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=264.9s)]
*  put in economic sanctions that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=266.9s)]
*  are slower working than many [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=268.9s)]
*  people would like. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=271.9s)]
*  But how does ideologically [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=272.9s)]
*  democracy stand up in the face [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=276.9s)]
*  of this? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=278.9s)]
*  So, recall from the beginning of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=279.9s)]
*  our discussion that Putin's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=282.9s)]
*  version of fascism is not [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=285.9s)]
*  specifically about Russian [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=287.9s)]
*  ethnic Russians dominating the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=289.9s)]
*  world as German fascism was. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=292.9s)]
*  German fascism was about Aryans [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=294.9s)]
*  dominating the world. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=296.9s)]
*  It's about traditionalist [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=298.9s)]
*  ethno-nationalists dominating [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=300.9s)]
*  each of their countries with a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=302.9s)]
*  strong, powerful, masculine [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=305.9s)]
*  leader. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=307.9s)]
*  So, it could be a woman, I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=308.9s)]
*  suppose, as we see in France's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=310.9s)]
*  elections, but it's about a kind [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=312.9s)]
*  of, it's about protecting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=315.9s)]
*  supposedly traditional values [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=319.9s)]
*  against democracy, decadence, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=321.9s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=325.9s)]
*  So, what democracies must do is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=326.9s)]
*  that they must show that they're [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=329.9s)]
*  not corrupt, decadent, and weak. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=332.9s)]
*  That's what Putin believes. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=335.9s)]
*  That's what Putin fosters. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=337.9s)]
*  And I don't want to say Putin is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=339.9s)]
*  the singular agent here. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=342.9s)]
*  The United States has long had [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=344.9s)]
*  anti-democratic forces of this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=346.9s)]
*  sort that Putin allies with. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=348.9s)]
*  But democracies have to show that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=351.9s)]
*  they are strong. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=354.9s)]
*  And democracies can show they are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=355.9s)]
*  strong. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=358.9s)]
*  Ukraine is showing that it is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=359.9s)]
*  strong. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=361.9s)]
*  I remember my grandmother in her [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=362.9s)]
*  book, The Unforgotten, saying, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=364.9s)]
*  the Unforgotten, a 1958 book, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=366.9s)]
*  talks about how she's with my [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=369.9s)]
*  father in New York City. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=371.9s)]
*  They had just come from Hitler's [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=373.9s)]
*  Germany. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=375.9s)]
*  And my father is looking at these [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=376.9s)]
*  soldiers marching down Broadway. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=378.9s)]
*  It's 1941, chewing gum and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=380.9s)]
*  slapping each other's backs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=382.9s)]
*  And my father says they're never [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=384.9s)]
*  going to beat the Nazis because [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=386.9s)]
*  he had seen the Nazi army march [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=388.9s)]
*  down the Kufrassen Damm in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=390.9s)]
*  Berlin in strict order. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=392.9s)]
*  No, that's exactly why they will [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=394.9s)]
*  beat the Nazis. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=396.9s)]
*  And that's what Ukraine is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=397.9s)]
*  showing right now. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=399.9s)]
*  Ukraine is showing that democracies [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=400.9s)]
*  have strength and democracies have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=402.9s)]
*  value. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=404.9s)]
*  Democracies have strength when they [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=405.9s)]
*  stand up for their values, when [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=407.9s)]
*  they prove accountability. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=409.9s)]
*  And what Putin thinks, you know, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=411.9s)]
*  rightfully so, is that democracies [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=414.9s)]
*  have proven themselves to be [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=417.9s)]
*  hypocritical and weak. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=419.9s)]
*  Look, our democracies have always [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=420.9s)]
*  been partial. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=422.9s)]
*  So the best thing we can do is we [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=423.9s)]
*  can show that our democracies [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=425.9s)]
*  stand up for the values that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=428.9s)]
*  they represent, freedom and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=431.9s)]
*  equality. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=433.9s)]
*  Do you think that the events in the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=434.9s)]
*  past few years in the United States [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=436.9s)]
*  has weakened the, well, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=438.9s)]
*  brand of democracy that we've been [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=441.9s)]
*  exporting around the world? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=443.9s)]
*  And does Putin pick up on that and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=444.9s)]
*  say, look at this, you can meddle [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=446.9s)]
*  within an election, you can cause [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=449.9s)]
*  internal strife, but then you can [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=452.9s)]
*  even have people attack its own [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=455.9s)]
*  capital and frankly, you know, not [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=457.9s)]
*  be held accountable. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=460.9s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=461.9s)]
*  I don't like the language of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=462.9s)]
*  exporting because frankly, when we [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=464.9s)]
*  try to export democracy, it's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=466.9s)]
*  typically been at the barrel of a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=468.9s)]
*  gun. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=470.9s)]
*  And that is not how you export a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=471.9s)]
*  democracy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=473.9s)]
*  You export democracy by standing [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=474.9s)]
*  up for its values at home. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=476.9s)]
*  And we failed to do that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=478.9s)]
*  From our own, we failed in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=480.9s)]
*  accountability for our own imperial [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=483.9s)]
*  wars of aggression, like the Iraq [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=485.9s)]
*  War. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=487.9s)]
*  We failed with accountability for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=488.9s)]
*  the financial crisis and we failed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=490.9s)]
*  most recently with accountability [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=493.9s)]
*  for the attack on our own [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=495.9s)]
*  democracy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=497.9s)]
*  So obviously, Putin is right to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=498.9s)]
*  think that democracies are weak and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=502.9s)]
*  don't stand up for their values. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=505.9s)]
*  If we can't hold accountable the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=507.9s)]
*  figures who led us into wars that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=510.9s)]
*  caused terrible devastations, if we [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=513.9s)]
*  can't hold accountable business [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=515.9s)]
*  leaders who destroyed our economy, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=517.9s)]
*  and if we can't hold accountable a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=519.9s)]
*  president who tried to steal the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=521.9s)]
*  election and destroy American [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=524.9s)]
*  democracy together with the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=526.9s)]
*  numerous senators and congressmen [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=527.9s)]
*  who helped him, then in what sense [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=530.9s)]
*  are we a democracy? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=532.9s)]
*  We don't have the rule of law. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=534.9s)]
*  And so in what sense do we have [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=536.9s)]
*  free and fair elections? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=539.9s)]
*  The threat to autocracies is free [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=541.9s)]
*  and fair elections. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=543.9s)]
*  You know, Putin can look at the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=545.9s)]
*  United States and he can direct the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=547.9s)]
*  world's gaze to the United States [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=550.9s)]
*  and show and say, see, look at what [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=552.9s)]
*  they're doing. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=555.9s)]
*  They're non-existent voter fraud, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=556.9s)]
*  yet they're fighting it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=558.9s)]
*  And so, you know, we have to be [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=560.9s)]
*  very clear that they're fighting [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=563.9s)]
*  it with an electoral police, with [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=566.9s)]
*  numerous legislation essentially to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=569.9s)]
*  restrict voting and to potentially [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=572.9s)]
*  steal another election. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=575.9s)]
*  So democracies do seem openly [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=577.9s)]
*  hypocritical and weak. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=581.9s)]
*  And that is obviously, that is what [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=583.9s)]
*  Russia wants. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=586.9s)]
*  Russia's not going to dominate the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=587.9s)]
*  world. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=589.9s)]
*  Russia is not a world power. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=590.9s)]
*  But Russia can help destroy [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=592.9s)]
*  democracy worldwide and thereby [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=595.9s)]
*  preserve its own autocratic regime [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=598.9s)]
*  at home. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=601.9s)]
*  One of the chapters in your book [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=602.9s)]
*  deals with a sexual anxiety that is [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=604.9s)]
*  often used in fascism. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=607.9s)]
*  And I wonder what you think when you [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=609.9s)]
*  look at the number of laws that are [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=612.9s)]
*  now making their way through state [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=615.9s)]
*  legislatures, either restricting [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=618.9s)]
*  women's control of their bodies or [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=620.9s)]
*  LGBTQIA rights in the United States. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=623.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=627.9s)]
*  So we should always remember, we [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=628.9s)]
*  citizens of a democracy, that the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=632.9s)]
*  principal values of democracy are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=634.9s)]
*  freedom and equality. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=636.9s)]
*  And among the freedoms that citizens [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=638.9s)]
*  of a democracy enjoy are the freedoms [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=641.9s)]
*  for, of the freedoms to identify how [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=644.9s)]
*  they want, to have the partners, to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=647.9s)]
*  have the adult partners they want. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=650.9s)]
*  And this freedom is under attack. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=653.9s)]
*  Now, this kind of attack on LGBT [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=656.9s)]
*  citizens is very Eastern European in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=659.9s)]
*  character. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=662.9s)]
*  It comes in the wake of an attack on [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=663.9s)]
*  so-called critical race theory, on [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=666.9s)]
*  critical race theory, but the attack is [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=668.9s)]
*  really not on critical race theory. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=670.9s)]
*  It's an attack on the teaching of our [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=672.9s)]
*  history, the teaching of our [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=674.9s)]
*  history. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=676.9s)]
*  And now we have an attack on LGBT [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=677.9s)]
*  rights. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=680.9s)]
*  And this is extremely, this is, this [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=681.9s)]
*  puts us into the worldwide autocratic [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=685.9s)]
*  context. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=688.9s)]
*  If you look at autocrats and would-be [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=689.9s)]
*  autocrats all over the world, from [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=692.9s)]
*  Russia's, Russia's gay propaganda law [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=695.9s)]
*  in 2013 that prohibits, prohibits [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=699.9s)]
*  teaching minors about, about non-standard [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=703.9s)]
*  lifestyles, of non-traditional [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=708.9s)]
*  lifestyles that was passed in 2013 and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=711.9s)]
*  had a terrible effect on the LGBT [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=716.9s)]
*  community in Russia. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=720.9s)]
*  If we look at Viktor Orban's Hungary, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=721.9s)]
*  the recent election was dominated by [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=723.9s)]
*  attacks on LGBT. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=726.9s)]
*  We look at Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=727.9s)]
*  he won election on, with attacks on LGBT. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=731.9s)]
*  We see the American right now embrace, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=735.9s)]
*  embracing this worldwide far-right [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=738.9s)]
*  autocratic attack on freedom. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=742.9s)]
*  And so this is, this is just putting us [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=745.9s)]
*  in line with the rest of the fascist [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=748.9s)]
*  right worldwide. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=752.9s)]
*  What is it about this that you think [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=753.9s)]
*  historically has stuck and even today [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=756.9s)]
*  makes it something that people can [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=760.9s)]
*  campaign on? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=762.9s)]
*  In the United States, the base for this [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=763.9s)]
*  far-right politics includes white [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=766.9s)]
*  nationalists. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=768.9s)]
*  But if you want to include some people [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=769.9s)]
*  who aren't white, go after a small [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=772.9s)]
*  minority like transgender Americans, a [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=775.9s)]
*  tiny group of Americans. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=778.9s)]
*  Then you can gather a lot of people [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=779.9s)]
*  because, you know, everyone is like, I'm [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=782.9s)]
*  not that, and so maybe I can join the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=784.9s)]
*  group and vilify them. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=787.9s)]
*  So this group of traditionalists can [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=789.9s)]
*  then gather. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=792.9s)]
*  And then even though this, you know, in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=793.9s)]
*  the United States, the audience here [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=795.9s)]
*  includes white nationalists who very [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=798.9s)]
*  prominently want to return to sort of a [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=801.9s)]
*  white, a state that prioritizes white [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=804.9s)]
*  Christianity. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=809.9s)]
*  You're never, they can have plausible [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=810.9s)]
*  deniability because they can say, look, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=812.9s)]
*  we've got black members of our movement [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=814.9s)]
*  who also share with us this antipathy to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=818.9s)]
*  LGBT. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=821.9s)]
*  So it's about, it's about gathering a [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=822.9s)]
*  larger coalition by ever greater [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=825.9s)]
*  vilification of a small minority while [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=829.9s)]
*  winking to the part of the coalition, the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=832.9s)]
*  large part of the coalition, that this is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=835.9s)]
*  really helping. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=837.9s)]
*  In the case of the United States, that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=838.9s)]
*  would be sort of white Christianity. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=840.9s)]
*  There was a piece in the New York Times [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=842.9s)]
*  recently, I think it's Elizabeth Diaz and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=844.9s)]
*  Ruth Graham, talking about how the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=846.9s)]
*  growing religious fervor in the far right [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=849.9s)]
*  movement is, it is starting to include [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=852.9s)]
*  religious iconography. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=855.9s)]
*  It is including praise music. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=857.9s)]
*  It's almost a little bit of a revival. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=860.9s)]
*  Now, not everybody under the tent, so to [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=863.9s)]
*  speak, is coming for a church service, but [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=865.9s)]
*  it's certainly pulling in people who are [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=868.9s)]
*  devout. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=871.9s)]
*  So that's because the global far right [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=872.9s)]
*  fascist movement presents itself as the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=876.9s)]
*  defender of traditional values. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=879.9s)]
*  And this is not new. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=881.9s)]
*  This is textbook fascist politics. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=882.9s)]
*  If you look at Joseph Goebbels' speech [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=886.9s)]
*  Communism with a Mask Off in 1935, Goebbels [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=888.9s)]
*  says that Jewish Bolshevism is threatening [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=893.9s)]
*  religious faith, Christianity, and that [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=898.9s)]
*  the only protection is national socialism. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=902.9s)]
*  So what Putin is doing is he's reviving [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=905.9s)]
*  these themes. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=909.9s)]
*  He's saying liberalism is a threat to [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=910.9s)]
*  tradition. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=914.9s)]
*  Of course, liberalism is not a threat to [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=915.9s)]
*  tradition. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=918.9s)]
*  Liberalism says that my Orthodox Jewish [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=919.9s)]
*  cousins can live however they want, and [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=922.9s)]
*  other people who aren't religious can also [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=925.9s)]
*  live however they want. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=927.9s)]
*  But the idea here is to create this fear [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=928.9s)]
*  among people who choose to live [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=932.9s)]
*  traditionally that other people's choices [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=935.9s)]
*  threaten them and in particular threaten [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=938.9s)]
*  their children. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=941.9s)]
*  And then you say to them, look, they're [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=942.9s)]
*  going after your children. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=944.9s)]
*  You need us to protect you. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=945.9s)]
*  And then you say, look, we can't play fair [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=947.9s)]
*  anymore. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=951.9s)]
*  What democracy is, and this goes back [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=952.9s)]
*  really to some of the oldest and worst [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=954.9s)]
*  tropes of the 20th century, like the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=956.9s)]
*  protocols of the elders of Zion. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=957.9s)]
*  What democracy is, is it's this method for [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=959.9s)]
*  pretend equality that says everyone can [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=962.9s)]
*  live how they want. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=964.9s)]
*  But then really what it does is these [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=966.9s)]
*  liberties allow them to get at your [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=969.9s)]
*  children and corrupt your children. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=972.9s)]
*  And so you create such fear among [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=974.9s)]
*  traditionalists that they abandon [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=976.9s)]
*  democracy. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=978.9s)]
*  As an example of that, Marjorie Taylor [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=979.9s)]
*  Greene tweeted the other day, Democrats, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=981.9s)]
*  I'm quoting, are the party of killing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=984.9s)]
*  babies, grooming and transitioning [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=987.9s)]
*  children and pro-pedophile politics. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=989.9s)]
*  In a recent poll, 49% of Republicans said [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=992.9s)]
*  it was, quote, definitely or probably [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=995.9s)]
*  true that top Democrats were involved in [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=998.9s)]
*  elite child sex trafficking rings. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1001.9s)]
*  QAnon conspiracies, these are growing [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1004.9s)]
*  viral. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1007.9s)]
*  And I'm wondering, this is not a small [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1008.9s)]
*  population of people in the United States [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1011.9s)]
*  that believe these things. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1013.9s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1016.9s)]
*  QAnon, as all scholars who have written [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1018.9s)]
*  on it have said, Talia Lavin, David [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1021.9s)]
*  Livingstone Smith, is connected clearly, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1024.9s)]
*  is clearly descended from blood libel, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1027.9s)]
*  the conspiracy theory against Jews that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1029.9s)]
*  Jews were stealing Christian babies for [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1032.9s)]
*  their religious rituals, and the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1035.9s)]
*  protocols of the elders of Zion. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1037.9s)]
*  It's this conspiracy that there's a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1039.9s)]
*  global cabal of elites, and the global [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1042.9s)]
*  cabal of elites is seeking to conquer [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1045.9s)]
*  the institutions to get at your children [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1048.9s)]
*  and control your children. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1051.9s)]
*  And so it's not, there's no fairness [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1054.9s)]
*  anymore, it's just war. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1057.9s)]
*  And you're not a man, if you can't stand [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1059.9s)]
*  up to this, because they're going after [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1062.9s)]
*  your women and children. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1064.9s)]
*  It's that level of fear and paranoia [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1066.9s)]
*  that is seeped into, I don't even think [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1069.9s)]
*  seeped into is the right word anymore, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1072.9s)]
*  that has permeated much of American [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1075.9s)]
*  politics. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1078.9s)]
*  And so it's a very extreme time when [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1079.9s)]
*  these sorts of old conspiracy theories [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9aKODtay6c&t=1082.9s)]
