Video Description: Soon the eyes of the world will be on Westminster Abbey for the coronation of Britain’s new king, in a ceremony meant to reflect the country’s modern and multicultural society. But behind the pomp and pageantry lies the shadow of Britain’s colonial legacy. Some question King Charles’ ability to usher in a new era of accountability. Michel Martin talks with Sathnam Sanghera, whose book “Empireland” is an examination of Britain’s complicated past.

*  Thanks, Christiane. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=29.82s)]
*  Sathnam Sanjira, thank you so [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=32.42s)]
*  much for talking with us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=34.32s)]
*  Oh, thanks for having me on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=35.72s)]
*  your show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=36.66s)]
*  Your book, Empire Land, was [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=37.52s)]
*  published in the UK in 2021, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=38.66s)]
*  and it explores sort of the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=41.02s)]
*  modern legacies of the British [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=43.26s)]
*  Empire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=44.86s)]
*  You know, you'd think that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  someone would have done that, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=47.8s)]
*  but apparently they have not. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=49.3s)]
*  So, like, what gave you the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=50.8s)]
*  idea? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=52.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I got to my mid- [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=53.14s)]
*  40s and realized I knew nothing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=55.6s)]
*  about empire, and yet it [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  explained so much about my life. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=58.44s)]
*  The reason I'm here in North [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=60.34s)]
*  London today is that some white [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  dudes invaded India in the 17th [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=63.44s)]
*  century. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=65.44s)]
*  Empire explains our [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=66.84s)]
*  multiculturalism, our racism, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=68.12s)]
*  our lot of our wealth, the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=69.88s)]
*  importance of the city of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=72.22s)]
*  London, and yet I knew almost [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=73.22s)]
*  nothing about it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=74.68s)]
*  And it turned out lots of other [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  people felt the same, and so I [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=77.16s)]
*  thought I'd try to plug in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=79.22s)]
*  gaps in my knowledge. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=80.4s)]
*  Why do you think that is, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=81.5s)]
*  though? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=82.66s)]
*  Obviously, there are some [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=83.26s)]
*  really loud debates going on in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=84.16s)]
*  the United States right now [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=86.66s)]
*  about slavery and our history and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=88.12s)]
*  so forth, but at least it's a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=89.6s)]
*  debate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=90.66s)]
*  You seem to sort of describe [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=91.66s)]
*  kind of a collective silence [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=93.24s)]
*  about this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=96.04s)]
*  Does that sound right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=96.8s)]
*  Yeah, and it's very strange, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=98.1s)]
*  given British Empire was the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=99.44s)]
*  biggest empire in human [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=100.78s)]
*  history. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=102.02s)]
*  It's the biggest thing Britain [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=102.68s)]
*  ever did, and we don't [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=104.02s)]
*  particularly teach it well, we [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=105.34s)]
*  don't talk about it, we don't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=106.38s)]
*  reflect it very well in our [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=107.92s)]
*  films, our culture. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=109.42s)]
*  My theory is that British [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=110.88s)]
*  Empire happened abroad. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=112.82s)]
*  So, unlike the French or the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=114.62s)]
*  Germans, we didn't have a dark [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=116.52s)]
*  night of the soul where we had [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=118.22s)]
*  to confront our history because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  it all happened abroad. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  And so, we could act like it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=123.88s)]
*  wasn't happening even when it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=126.02s)]
*  was happening, and it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  continues. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=128.62s)]
*  And now we are talking about, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=129.22s)]
*  the world is talking about the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  legacy of slavery, the legacies [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=131.72s)]
*  of loot and so on, and Britain [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=133.6s)]
*  still feels quite disconnected [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=135.7s)]
*  from the conversation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=137.5s)]
*  How do you think all this is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=138.94s)]
*  playing out in the events that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=140.04s)]
*  are about to unfold with the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=143.14s)]
*  coronation of King Charles? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=144.56s)]
*  Do you feel that this kind of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  reckoning is in a way kind of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=149.22s)]
*  bubbling under the surface? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=151.56s)]
*  Yeah, I guess the main [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=153.6s)]
*  difference between the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=155.0s)]
*  coronation this year and the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=155.7s)]
*  one last one in 953 is that in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=157.0s)]
*  953 they talked explicitly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=159.34s)]
*  about empire occasionally, but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=161.14s)]
*  now we act like it never [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=162.78s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=163.88s)]
*  So, in 953 the Queen talked [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  about the colonies, she had a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  dress which was sewn with the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=167.28s)]
*  emblems of empire. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=169.04s)]
*  But now, all the things to do [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=170.42s)]
*  with empire, the multiculturalism [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  of the ceremony, the fact that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  some of the jewels and the crown [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=174.61999999999998s)]
*  jewels were looted, the fact [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  that the Lord's Prayer is going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=177.76s)]
*  to be said in multiple languages, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  people don't connect it with the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=180.94s)]
*  fact that we ran the biggest [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  empire in human history. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's because if we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=185.64s)]
*  acknowledge that fact, we'd have [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  to talk about the legacies of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  slavery, we'd have to talk about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=190.28s)]
*  reparations, and that's a very [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=192.0s)]
*  difficult conversation for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=193.82s)]
*  Britain to have. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  You said that King Charles III's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  coronation has failed before a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  single drop of holy oil has [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=200.72s)]
*  anointed his hands, breasts, or [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=202.76s)]
*  head. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=204.8s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=205.56s)]
*  Well, right from the beginning, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=206.96s)]
*  one of the first things the royal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=208.1s)]
*  household did in the run-up to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=209.36s)]
*  coronation is that they said [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=210.6s)]
*  they weren't going to use the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=212.36s)]
*  Koh-i-Noor diamond in the crown [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=213.3s)]
*  jewels, and that's the diamond [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=215.14s)]
*  that the Indians won back [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=216.9s)]
*  because it was looted from a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=218.5s)]
*  10-year-old Sikh Maharaja. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=220.34s)]
*  And actually, the Iranians won [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=221.98s)]
*  it back, the Afghanis won it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=223.04s)]
*  back, and so the royal household [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=224.18s)]
*  thought, you know what, we just [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=225.62s)]
*  won't use it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=226.52s)]
*  But instead, they're using a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=227.38s)]
*  crown which features a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=228.32s)]
*  Kulinun diamond, which is a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=229.32s)]
*  South African diamond, which is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=230.92s)]
*  also highly contested. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=232.32s)]
*  And it just shows you how they [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=234.76s)]
*  just can't run away from the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=235.82s)]
*  history. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=237.06s)]
*  There's also been a series of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=237.76s)]
*  revelations about slavery, about [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  the royal family's involvement [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  in slavery. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  And I think people have always [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=243.06s)]
*  understood that, you know, Queen [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=244.34s)]
*  Elizabeth I was involved in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=245.5s)]
*  early slave-trading journeys. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=247.14s)]
*  She loaned her ship to one of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=249.1s)]
*  the first slave traders. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  But I think people didn't realize [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=252.6s)]
*  that the royal African company [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=253.74s)]
*  was so involved that 187,000 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=254.84s)]
*  Africans were shipped across [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=258.88s)]
*  the Atlantic, that the royal [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  African company was governed [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=261.54s)]
*  from royal palaces, that when [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  the slaves arrived in places [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=264.88s)]
*  like Barbados, they had the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=266.44s)]
*  initials of the Duke of York [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=268.14000000000004s)]
*  branded into their flesh. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  I think the British public has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=271.32s)]
*  been quite shocked by the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=273.32s)]
*  details, and it's quite strange [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  that this is all coming out [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  hundreds of years later, but [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  it's just one of those things. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=279.32000000000005s)]
*  And I feel that the British [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  establishment can't really deal [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=282.82000000000005s)]
*  with the implications. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=285.56s)]
*  How are they dealing with it in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=286.86s)]
*  the run-up to the coronation? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  Is the royal family dealing with [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=289.96s)]
*  this legacy in any meaningful way [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=291.9s)]
*  in the course of these [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=294.4s)]
*  festivities? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, King Charles did say [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=296.5s)]
*  something new and very unexpected [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=298.2s)]
*  the other week, where he said he [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=300.73999999999995s)]
*  approved a research being done [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  into how the royal family were [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=304.44s)]
*  involved in slavery. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  He also said he wants to learn [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=307.38s)]
*  about slavery, which is, it [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=308.64s)]
*  feels like a bit late, given he's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=310.32s)]
*  70 years old. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=311.58s)]
*  And the research that he's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=313.12s)]
*  allowed, it feels a little, not [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  much, and very late. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=319.64s)]
*  Basically, it involves allowing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=321.18s)]
*  one Ph.D. researcher access to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=323.42s)]
*  the archives, and she's going to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=326.76s)]
*  report in 2026. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=328.46s)]
*  And compared to what the Dutch [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=330.22s)]
*  royal household are doing, it's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=331.62s)]
*  not much. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=333.36s)]
*  I mean, they've commissioned an [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=333.76s)]
*  entire committee of historians [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=334.52s)]
*  to look into this history. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=336.4s)]
*  And actually, they might reveal [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=337.8s)]
*  things about the royal household [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=339.1s)]
*  before the British do, because [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  William III was both a British [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=342.64s)]
*  monarch and a Dutch prince. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=344.7s)]
*  And so it's pretty embarrassing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=346.8s)]
*  that another country is going to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=348.4s)]
*  make revelations about this [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=350.4s)]
*  history before we do. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=351.6s)]
*  One of the things I was [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=353.04s)]
*  impressed about your book, too, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=353.64s)]
*  is your book doesn't sort of try [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=354.74s)]
*  to wash away the history. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=358.12s)]
*  It doesn't try to exonerate [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=360.78s)]
*  people for their behavior, but [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=364.28s)]
*  it doesn't condemn them either. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=365.92s)]
*  I mean, it describes the facts [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=367.82s)]
*  of life as they were. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=371.12s)]
*  And so what are some of those [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  facts? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=375.1s)]
*  I'm really glad you say that, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=376.1s)]
*  because I think too often this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=376.9s)]
*  history is seen through the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=378.12s)]
*  prism of pride or shame. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=379.06s)]
*  And actually, we should just try [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  to understand it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=382.62s)]
*  And when you try to understand [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=383.56s)]
*  it, the British Empire was so [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=384.86s)]
*  influential. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  One of the main reasons we're [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=387.06s)]
*  speaking English today to each [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=388.5s)]
*  other is because of the British [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=389.86s)]
*  Empire. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  The popularity of cricket, the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=392.3s)]
*  Indian diaspora is largely the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  result of the fact that the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  British sent a million Indians [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=397.74s)]
*  around the world to do the jobs [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  of the enslaved once they [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=400.68s)]
*  abolish slavery. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=401.88s)]
*  The existence of countries like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=403.14000000000004s)]
*  India, Pakistan, Nigeria is all [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=404.88s)]
*  down to the British Empire. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=407.5s)]
*  The chaos in places like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=408.94s)]
*  Kashmir, Sudan at the moment, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=411.14000000000004s)]
*  and even Palestine can be [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=414.48s)]
*  explained by the British [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  Empire. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  So I think if you want to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=417.48s)]
*  understand the world and world [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=418.22s)]
*  history, you've got to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=420.82s)]
*  understand the British Empire, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=421.62s)]
*  because it was one of the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=422.66s)]
*  biggest things that ever [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=423.36s)]
*  happened. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=424.36s)]
*  And it happened over 400 years [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=425.02000000000004s)]
*  as well. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=426.56s)]
*  Why do you think it is that we [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=427.32s)]
*  romanticize this institution, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  particularly the royal family, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  to the degree that we continue [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=435.78s)]
*  to do? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=437.58s)]
*  I kind of feel like, didn't we [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=438.28s)]
*  fight a war over here so as we [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=439.86s)]
*  could not care about these [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=441.52s)]
*  people? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=442.62s)]
*  And yet we're still, like, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=443.36s)]
*  obsessed with them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=444.96s)]
*  And I'm just like, why is that? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=446.02s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=447.46s)]
*  I think it's partly, it's a very [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  complicated history. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=451.26s)]
*  It's quite hard to get your [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  head around. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=453.5s)]
*  It's much easier to say, to tell [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=454.2s)]
*  very simplified stories. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  This is a history that covered a [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=458.4s)]
*  quarter of the planet. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=459.84s)]
*  It covered 400 years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's very contradictory [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=463.08s)]
*  history. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=464.18s)]
*  At one point, the British were [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=464.5s)]
*  heavily into slavery. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=466.0s)]
*  They dominated the slave trade at [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=467.6s)]
*  one point. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=468.86s)]
*  But then they abolished it and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=469.6s)]
*  they went around the world [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  trying to get rid of slavery. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=472.34000000000003s)]
*  At one point, it wasn't allowed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  for English people to get [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=475.74s)]
*  involved romantically with brown [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  people in India. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  But then another time, it was [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=480.68s)]
*  okay. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=482.02000000000004s)]
*  So this is very complicated [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=482.72s)]
*  history. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  It's much easier to tell simple [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=485.02000000000004s)]
*  stories, or it's much easier to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=486.82s)]
*  focus on World War I or World [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=488.32s)]
*  War II, which have clear [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=490.66s)]
*  narratives, clear beginning, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=491.86s)]
*  clear end. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=494.08s)]
*  And academics can't even agree [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=494.64s)]
*  on when the British Empire began [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=497.24s)]
*  and when it ended. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=499.02s)]
*  Empireland was published in the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  UK in 2021, but an edition [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=501.58s)]
*  published this year opens with a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=503.96s)]
*  note specifically for American [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=505.44s)]
*  readers. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=508.16s)]
*  As briefly as you can, could you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=509.12s)]
*  just describe kind of the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=510.96s)]
*  interplay between those two or [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=512.12s)]
*  some of the ways that the British [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=514.78s)]
*  Empire affected the shaping of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=515.88s)]
*  the American story? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=517.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think Americans like to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=518.96s)]
*  see themselves as anti-imperialist, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=520.28s)]
*  but I don't buy it because [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=522.3s)]
*  America itself is a creation of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=524.18s)]
*  British Empire. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=526.02s)]
*  The 13 colonies were distinct [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=527.02s)]
*  phase of British Empire. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=529.02s)]
*  And the way America then expanded [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  echoed the way British colonies [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  like Australia and South Africa [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  expanded with the kind of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=536.3s)]
*  residential school system, the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  reserve confinement, the settler [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=540.54s)]
*  colonialism. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=542.5799999999999s)]
*  And then you have people like [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=543.74s)]
*  Theodore Roosevelt talking about [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=544.66s)]
*  how he admired the way [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=546.78s)]
*  British Empire dealt with India [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  and how that was a model for the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=550.6s)]
*  way America could deal with the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=552.44s)]
*  Philippines and the West Indies. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=553.96s)]
*  And I think British Empire and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=555.44s)]
*  America are intricately linked. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you think the country, the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=560.12s)]
*  countries of the United Kingdom [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=562.44s)]
*  are ready to face this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=564.0s)]
*  history? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=566.96s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=567.64s)]
*  And I think mainly because of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=568.24s)]
*  multiculturalism. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  The main reason we are a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=570.6s)]
*  multicultural nation today is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=572.0s)]
*  because we had a multicultural [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=574.0s)]
*  empire. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  One of the main reasons we have [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=576.44s)]
*  an Asian prime minister is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  because of empire. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=579.78s)]
*  And this is history we've always [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  struggled to explain. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=582.58s)]
*  I grew up with a narrative that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=584.46s)]
*  brown people came here uninvited [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=586.02s)]
*  and took advantage of British [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=588.5s)]
*  hospitality. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=590.02s)]
*  It's a narrative that exists in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=590.5s)]
*  America, too. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=591.86s)]
*  What I didn't know is that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=593.1s)]
*  actually in the 1950s, brown and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=594.9399999999999s)]
*  black people came to Britain as [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=597.26s)]
*  citizens, as British citizens. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=598.9s)]
*  And that is very poorly [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=601.5s)]
*  understood. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=603.14s)]
*  And it's led to a whole bunch of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=604.1s)]
*  scandals and a whole bunch of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=606.14s)]
*  racist policies. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=608.0s)]
*  It's resulted in something called [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=609.0s)]
*  the Windrush scandal where the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=610.24s)]
*  children of immigrants have been [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=613.2s)]
*  returned to countries they don't [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=614.44s)]
*  even know. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=616.1800000000001s)]
*  That is the level of the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=617.08s)]
*  ignorance. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=618.78s)]
*  And I think people have had [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=619.14s)]
*  enough. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=619.94s)]
*  And suddenly I think young [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=620.24s)]
*  people are going to school and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=621.88s)]
*  saying to their teachers, teach [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=623.36s)]
*  me about colonialism. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=625.26s)]
*  Teach me about how it shapes our [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=626.28s)]
*  modern world. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=627.98s)]
*  And regardless of what is allowed [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=629.16s)]
*  in the national curriculum, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=630.96s)]
*  they're having to teach it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=632.36s)]
*  And is there the same resentment [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=633.6s)]
*  of that as we are now seeing in [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=635.36s)]
*  the United States? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=637.6199999999999s)]
*  I mean, as you as you probably [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=638.4799999999999s)]
*  know, you know, there's been this [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=641.28s)]
*  tremendous backlash against [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=642.68s)]
*  teaching African-American history [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=644.1199999999999s)]
*  against the, you know, accurate [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=646.4599999999999s)]
*  teaching of the horrors of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  slavery. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=649.7199999999999s)]
*  Is there a similar backlash? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=650.52s)]
*  Like, how dare you? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=652.0999999999999s)]
*  This is wokeism. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=652.92s)]
*  This business, I'm afraid exactly [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=653.92s)]
*  the same thing is happening in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=655.8s)]
*  Britain. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  We've even started having the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=657.76s)]
*  book banning. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=659.0s)]
*  People are going to libraries and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=659.5s)]
*  saying, why are you stopping this [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=660.64s)]
*  woke book? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=662.0s)]
*  And it's reflected actually in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=663.04s)]
*  government policy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=667.12s)]
*  You've had politicians getting [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=667.8199999999999s)]
*  involved in this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=669.76s)]
*  And we have a culture war in [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  Britain where our leading [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  politicians have got involved in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=673.5999999999999s)]
*  imperial history and started [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=675.0999999999999s)]
*  saying things like, you know, if [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=676.16s)]
*  you want to be if you're proud of [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=678.0s)]
*  being British, you should be [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=679.0s)]
*  proud of the history. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=680.5799999999999s)]
*  It's such an inane thing to say [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  because history is long and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  complicated. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=685.5799999999999s)]
*  And yet politicians are putting [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=686.74s)]
*  forward a very simplistic view. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=688.74s)]
*  And we even had Rishi Sunak say [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=690.88s)]
*  at one point that he was going to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=692.98s)]
*  report people who did Britain [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=694.2199999999999s)]
*  down in history to prevent the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  anti-terrorism agency. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  So we've got the unhappy scene [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=700.94s)]
*  where the children of imperial [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=702.84s)]
*  immigrants are themselves getting [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=705.38s)]

*  happens in America eventually [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=709.7800000000001s)]

*  Sunak's view of this or how he's [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=714.0600000000001s)]

*  When he's a conservative prime [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=719.46s)]

*  conservative politicians have to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=722.5400000000001s)]
*  say certain things. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=724.5s)]
*  And actually the British cabinet [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=726.02s)]
*  is very ethnically diverse and [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=727.76s)]
*  they all say things which are [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=729.92s)]
*  anti-immigration, anti-woke and [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=731.96s)]
*  anti-racist if that makes sense. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=735.46s)]
*  You know? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=738.1s)]
*  And it seems that you can make it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=738.46s)]
*  to the top in Britain as a brown [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=740.16s)]
*  person or a black person. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=742.3s)]
*  But you've got to agree to leave [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=744.5s)]
*  things as they are when it comes [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=746.2s)]
*  to race. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=748.04s)]
*  And I think that's a very [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=748.84s)]
*  depressing state of affairs. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=750.7s)]
*  And that is in true diversity. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=751.98s)]
*  I get the feeling that if you're [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=753.48s)]
*  conservative you're not allowed [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=755.14s)]
*  to bring your full self to the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=756.4s)]
*  cabinet table. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=758.6s)]
*  Is there the argument that this [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=759.68s)]
*  is... [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=761.98s)]
*  It doesn't contribute to national [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=764.74s)]
*  unity. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=766.14s)]
*  That if you were to look at this [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=766.92s)]
*  in its totality that that somehow [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=767.78s)]
*  makes people ashamed of their [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=769.28s)]
*  country or that it's, you know, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=770.42s)]
*  divisive or that it sort of is [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=772.52s)]
*  a... [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=775.62s)]
*  It's dangerous to national unity. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=776.76s)]
*  If we understand this history it [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=779.76s)]
*  brings us close together. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=781.2s)]
*  I mean my understanding of this [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=782.4s)]
*  history has made me realize that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=784.58s)]
*  people of color have been here [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=787.32s)]
*  since the days of Henry VII, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=788.88s)]
*  you know? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=791.06s)]
*  And a profound part of our [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=791.76s)]
*  national stories, World War I and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=793.46s)]
*  World War II. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=794.96s)]
*  And no one taught me at school [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=796.02s)]
*  that millions of soldiers from [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=797.36s)]
*  India and Africa fought for the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=799.2s)]
*  British Empire. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=801.3s)]
*  You know, I sat through dozens, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=802.56s)]
*  probably hundreds of ceremonies [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=804.6s)]
*  of World War II at school. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=806.74s)]
*  And no one ever mentioned that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=808.5s)]
*  people like me were there. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=810.28s)]
*  And deleting this history, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=811.76s)]
*  that's the thing that divides [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=814.86s)]
*  people. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=816.16s)]
*  Knowing it and knowledge brings [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=817.02s)]
*  us together. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=818.96s)]
*  You were saying that a British [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=820.0s)]
*  education encouraged you to view [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=821.64s)]
*  your Indian heritage through [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=824.76s)]
*  patronizing Western eyes. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=826.66s)]
*  Would you just say a little bit [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=828.24s)]
*  more about that? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=829.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the main [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=830.3s)]
*  tools of British imperialism was [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=831.34s)]
*  education. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=832.7s)]
*  Even today a lot of world leaders [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=833.84s)]
*  have a British education. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=835.62s)]
*  And what that does, enforces or [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=837.34s)]
*  spreads certain ideas about [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=839.66s)]
*  Britain, certain ideas about the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=841.46s)]
*  West. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=843.24s)]
*  I definitely was subjected to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=843.84s)]
*  those. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=845.34s)]
*  I had supposedly one of the best [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=845.64s)]
*  education in the world. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=847.3s)]
*  I went to a private school on a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=848.28s)]
*  scholarship and then I went to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=850.58s)]
*  Cambridge University. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=851.72s)]
*  But I didn't study a single Brown [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=852.64s)]
*  writer until my final term at [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=855.02s)]
*  university. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=856.64s)]
*  And it was a very selective [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=857.64s)]
*  education, a failure in education, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=858.98s)]
*  actually. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=861.18s)]
*  And looking back, it was a form [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=861.96s)]
*  of colonization, really, if that [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=863.92s)]
*  makes sense. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=866.16s)]
*  So let's loop back to this [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=867.22s)]
*  weekend's events. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=868.92s)]
*  Will this history in any way be [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=870.22s)]
*  visible in these ceremonies? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=873.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a very [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=875.76s)]
*  multicultural ceremony. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=876.96s)]
*  It has to be because as a king, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=878.6s)]
*  he's the head of a multicultural [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=880.86s)]
*  country and also the head of the [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=882.0s)]
*  multicultural Commonwealth, the [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=883.5s)]
*  collection of 56 former British [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=884.9s)]
*  imperial states. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=887.98s)]
*  So the British government can [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=889.5s)]
*  engage in these culture wars, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=891.0s)]
*  but the monarch can't really [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=892.68s)]
*  because he's got to head this [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=894.42s)]
*  international association of [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=896.12s)]
*  countries. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=897.92s)]
*  And actually, one of the things [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=898.42s)]
*  they really want to talk about [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=899.9599999999999s)]
*  is the legacies of slavery and [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=901.8s)]
*  the legacies of empire. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=903.3s)]
*  And it's something the government [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=904.9s)]
*  doesn't necessarily want to talk [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=906.06s)]
*  about. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=907.16s)]
*  But I think you're going to see [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=907.66s)]
*  a very multicultural, very [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=908.3s)]
*  inclusive ceremony. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=911.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Lord's Prayer is [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=912.4s)]
*  being said in multiple languages. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=913.38s)]
*  There's people from the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=915.28s)]
*  Commonwealth. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=916.04s)]
*  I think it's going to be [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=918.3399999999999s)]
*  reflecting of empire, although [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=919.4799999999999s)]
*  you won't hear the word empire. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=921.12s)]
*  Can I just go back to the whole [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=924.18s)]
*  Prince Harry, Meghan Markle [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=925.88s)]
*  situation? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=927.28s)]
*  It did seem for a minute that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=928.38s)]
*  her acceptance into the family [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  signaled something like a [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=932.5799999999999s)]
*  willingness to live in the world [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=933.98s)]
*  as it is as a person in the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=935.8199999999999s)]
*  world that was. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=937.76s)]
*  And that that does not seem to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=939.02s)]
*  have happened at all. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=940.5s)]
*  What's your take on that? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=941.3s)]
*  It says a lot about the state of [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=942.4599999999999s)]
*  affairs when it comes to race [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=945.06s)]
*  because finally the royal family [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  had a person of color as part of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=948.3s)]
*  the family, which reflected [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=951.3s)]
*  multicultural Britain. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=953.54s)]
*  This was an amazing thing for so [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=954.54s)]
*  many people of color in Britain. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=956.18s)]
*  And I can't help noticing it [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  went very, very wrong. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  And she's not even coming. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=961.28s)]
*  And I've traveled around the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=962.66s)]
*  former empire this year. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=964.12s)]
*  And there's a view that this is [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=965.68s)]
*  a reflective of the racism of [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=967.02s)]
*  the royal family. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=969.3599999999999s)]
*  And actually, there's much less [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=970.16s)]
*  support in multicultural Britain [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=972.0s)]
*  for the monarchy than there is [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=974.06s)]
*  generally. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=975.5s)]
*  I think 38 percent of ethnic [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=976.3s)]
*  people in Britain support the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=979.0999999999999s)]
*  monarchy, whereas the general [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=980.54s)]
*  figure is 68 percent. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=981.54s)]
*  And I think this is a real [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=982.9799999999999s)]
*  problem for the royal family. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  Because they also historically [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=986.14s)]
*  tied up in the racism of British [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=988.3s)]
*  Empire. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=989.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, Black and Asian immigrant [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=990.4s)]
*  staff were banned from working [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=992.64s)]
*  in clerical roles in Buckingham [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=994.58s)]
*  Palace until the late 1960s. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=996.08s)]
*  And even now, Buckingham Palace [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=998.62s)]
*  is excluded from a lot of equality [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=999.9399999999999s)]
*  legislation. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1001.92s)]
*  Do you have any sense, and I [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1002.68s)]
*  understand that you're not a royal [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1003.8199999999999s)]
*  whisperer, but do you have any [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1005.06s)]
*  sense of whether the royal family [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1007.36s)]
*  writ large, particularly King [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1009.26s)]
*  Charles, cares about any of this? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1010.7s)]
*  Actually, no. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1014.0s)]
*  Prince Charles, when he was [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1014.4s)]
*  king, he really cared about it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1015.28s)]
*  He ran this charity called [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1016.76s)]
*  Prince's Trust, which did loads [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1018.76s)]
*  of work with the Black community, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1020.46s)]
*  Black businesses. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1021.86s)]
*  He's spoken up in defense of [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1023.02s)]
*  Islam. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1024.6s)]
*  He called himself a defender of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1025.8s)]
*  the faith, plural, rather than [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1027.6s)]
*  just the defender of the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1028.9s)]
*  Christian faith. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1029.74s)]
*  He's pretty woke. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1031.0s)]
*  And actually, I think the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1032.8s)]
*  establishment disliked him for [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1034.6s)]
*  that. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1036.28s)]
*  And it's going to be interesting [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1036.84s)]
*  to see how he plays it, because [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1038.58s)]
*  now he is the ultimate [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1039.82s)]
*  establishment. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1041.12s)]
*  And there's a tension between [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1042.04s)]
*  what he believes and what he [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1043.82s)]
*  needs to do as the head of the [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1044.9s)]
*  Commonwealth and what this [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  current government wants to do. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1047.14s)]
*  And I don't know how that's going [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1048.64s)]
*  to play out. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1050.3000000000002s)]
*  Before we let you go, have there [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1051.98s)]
*  been efforts to ban your book? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1053.38s)]
*  My publisher gave out 15,000 [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1056.44s)]
*  copies to British schools, so [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1058.18s)]
*  that's been nice. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1059.8200000000002s)]
*  But, yes, I've had a massive [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1060.5200000000002s)]
*  backlash in terms of racism and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1062.46s)]
*  racist abuse, and I've actually [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1064.7600000000002s)]
*  stopped doing events because so [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1066.46s)]
*  many people come to them to just [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1068.0s)]
*  shout at me. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1069.16s)]
*  But it also makes me realize I'm [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1070.2s)]
*  doing important work. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1072.2600000000002s)]
*  And whenever people do shout at [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1073.8999999999999s)]
*  me, I have so many people buying [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  the book and trying to engage [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1077.6s)]
*  with me to make up for that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1079.34s)]
*  And I think I need to focus more [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1080.5s)]
*  on the positive, that's hard to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1082.4399999999998s)]
*  do sometimes. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1083.74s)]
*  Well, Sathnam Sengira, thanks so [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1084.84s)]
*  much for talking with us. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IecMJWIlKO0&t=1086.1799999999998s)]
