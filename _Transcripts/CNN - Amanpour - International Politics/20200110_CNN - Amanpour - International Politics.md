Video Description: A recent study suggests most Americans could not locate Iran on a map. But U.S. has a long and complicated history with that country, dating back to before the Ayatollahs came to power in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Ervand Abrahamian is an Iranian-Armenian author, historian, and university professor whose book The Coup is the latest development in his ongoing work unpacking U.S./Iranian relations. Walter Isaacson sits down with him to discuss the events that contributed to the distrust and hostility between these two nations.

*  nations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=34.7s)]
*  Let's set this into historical [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=36.3s)]
*  context and begin in 1951 when [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=38.94s)]
*  Iran nationalizes its oil [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  industry. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=45.44s)]
*  How does that set a context for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=46.44s)]
*  what's happening? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  It's a very important background [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=49.42s)]
*  context because for Iran, the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  nationalization of oil in 51 was [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=56.080000000000005s)]
*  the same as other colonial [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  powers getting, colonial states [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=62.22s)]
*  getting their independence from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=64.76s)]
*  the former colonial ruler. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=67.26s)]
*  So it was a way of declaration [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=70.7s)]
*  of independence from Britain to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  take over the main natural [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  resource Iran had, which was oil. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=78.48s)]
*  It was, in fact, equivalent to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=81.18s)]
*  Indian independence, Ghanan [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=84.1s)]
*  independence, Indonesian [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  independence. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=87.38s)]
*  They've even lower the oil [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=88.38s)]
*  company flag and raised the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=89.38s)]
*  Iranian flag as if it were a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=90.94s)]
*  transfer of colonial power. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=92.74s)]
*  It was, and it was seen that way [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=94.34s)]
*  both in Iran and Britain. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=95.72s)]
*  So if you look at the British [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=98.52s)]
*  press at that time, especially [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=99.96s)]
*  the newspapers like the Daily [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=102.06s)]
*  Telegraph, conservative papers, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  they saw this as another sort of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=106.52s)]
*  blow against the British empire. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=108.1s)]
*  To try to balance that off, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=111.1s)]
*  actually, that when the flag was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=113.32s)]
*  lowered and the Iranian flag was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  raised, the RAF flew jets of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=116.96s)]
*  planes over and over again in a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=120.72s)]
*  way to say we still have the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=123.0s)]
*  basically the military power. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=125.0s)]
*  But then Britain and the United [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=127.34s)]
*  States, CIA, MI6 in 1953 foment [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=130.1s)]
*  a coup in order to reverse this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=134.68s)]
*  decision. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=137.62s)]
*  Was that about oil or was that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=138.78s)]
*  about decolonization? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=141.10000000000002s)]
*  The very historical question is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  really why was the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  interested in helping a coup? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=146.8s)]
*  And I think what the argument [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  really was at that time that if [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=152.44s)]
*  Iran succeeds in nationalizing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=156.72000000000003s)]
*  the oil industry, even though [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=159.78s)]
*  it's a British oil industry, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=162.06s)]
*  this will start a bad example [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  in other countries where [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=167.56s)]
*  American oil interests were, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=169.34s)]
*  like Venezuela, Indonesia, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=172.28s)]
*  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, that those [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=176.12s)]
*  countries would try to basically [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=178.92s)]
*  follow the example of Iran and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=181.32s)]
*  you would get a swift basically [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=184.1s)]
*  snowballing effect of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=187.06s)]
*  nationalization of oil and that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  would really weaken American [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=192.2s)]
*  interests. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  So it was basically the fear of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=194.44s)]
*  a bad example leading to what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=197.36s)]
*  would be repercussions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=200.5s)]
*  Of course, eventually in the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=202.04s)]
*  70s, 1970s, oil was nationalized [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=203.1s)]
*  throughout most of these [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=208.64s)]
*  countries. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=209.54s)]
*  But in 1951, it was seen by both [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=210.08s)]
*  the State Department and the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=214.12s)]
*  American oil companies that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=215.88s)]
*  basically would be the end of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=218.02s)]
*  Western civilization as we knew [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=219.66s)]
*  it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=221.72s)]
*  The sky would fall if these [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=222.36s)]
*  natives, countries basically [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=224.56s)]
*  took over their oil. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=227.18s)]
*  So we put, meaning the United [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  States and the West, the Shah, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=230.66s)]
*  the Shah of Iran, into power [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=232.96s)]
*  after that coup in 53 or back [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=235.12s)]
*  into power as a real ruler of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=237.06s)]
*  the nation and he becomes a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=238.9s)]
*  linchpin of Western security in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=240.5s)]
*  the region. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=243.2s)]
*  How long did that last? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=244.74s)]
*  It lasted basically from 53 to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=246.78s)]
*  79 and superficially it looked [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=249.98s)]
*  very stable. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=253.78s)]
*  Here we had a monarch, claimed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=254.86s)]
*  2,500 year history of monarchy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=257.7s)]
*  He had a huge army, huge military [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=260.84s)]
*  forces, a huge bureaucracy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=263.54s)]
*  And of course, after the oil [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=266.84s)]
*  boom of 73, unlimited oil [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=268.38s)]
*  resources. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=271.22s)]
*  So on the surface, it looked [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=271.92s)]
*  like a very stable, formidable [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=274.42s)]
*  ally. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=277.22s)]
*  That's why Nixon basically [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=278.32s)]
*  appointed him American policeman [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=280.12s)]
*  of the region. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=282.72s)]
*  But it doesn't work. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, in this 1979, there's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=285.29999999999995s)]
*  suddenly a huge revolution, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=287.9s)]
*  which most people don't predict, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=290.34s)]
*  right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=292.08s)]
*  Well, that's the problem. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=292.74s)]
*  On surface, because it seems so [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=294.64s)]
*  formidable, it looked like it was [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=296.82s)]
*  going to last even in 1978. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=299.32s)]
*  The CIA's estimate was that, you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  know, there would be no problems [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=304.68s)]
*  in Iran until the oil runs out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=306.32s)]
*  The problem with their analysis [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=309.26s)]
*  was that they didn't really [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=311.76s)]
*  understand that the 53 coup had [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=313.22s)]

*  Yes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=326.84000000000003s)]

*  happened in 53? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the memory of 53 was very [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=329.38000000000005s)]
*  formidable. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was the main event [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=333.12s)]

*  memory. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=338.98s)]
*  And they knew, I mean, everyone [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=339.98s)]
*  basically knew that this regime [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=342.54s)]
*  was installed by the British and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  the Americans in 53. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=347.42s)]
*  So it was, but more than that, it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=349.36s)]
*  was installed by overthrowing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=352.8s)]
*  Mossad there, who was seen as the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=356.56s)]

*  Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=363.14s)]

*  It wouldn't have legitimacy of an [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  independent state. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  What was life like in the 70s [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=378.94s)]
*  under the shah? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=382.82s)]
*  For the middle class, upper class, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=384.02s)]
*  it was actually quite good because [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=386.26s)]
*  with the oil boom, there was [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=388.26s)]
*  considerable amount of economic [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  prosperity at the higher levels. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=393.36s)]
*  But on the general public, there [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=396.14s)]
*  was still deprivation. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=399.56s)]
*  There was lack of schooling, lack [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=403.52s)]
*  of universities, lack of medical [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=405.26s)]
*  care. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=407.46s)]
*  Those issues really then [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=408.86s)]
*  aggravated class differences [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=410.46s)]
*  between the better off and less [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=413.46s)]
*  off. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  So the revolution became very [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=416.5s)]
*  much also an uprising of the poor [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=418.14s)]
*  against the regime. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=422.08s)]
*  We know the revolution, the way [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=423.62s)]
*  you describe it in your book, is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=425.38s)]
*  also a uprising that's populist, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=426.68s)]
*  that's religious, that's somewhat [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=431.54s)]
*  paranoid, very fervent, almost [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=433.58s)]
*  alt-right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=436.82s)]
*  It seems like it's part of a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=438.12s)]
*  whole global populist rebellion. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=439.42s)]
*  The best way to define it, some [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=442.32s)]
*  people called it fundamentalist. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=444.06s)]
*  So there was religion, but the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=446.26s)]
*  way the clerics reinterpreted [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=448.4s)]
*  Islam was a very, very new way [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=451.1s)]
*  that really made it into a right [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=454.4s)]
*  wing populist movement. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=456.41999999999996s)]
*  So they tapped into things such [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  as nationalism, anti-imperialism, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=460.35999999999996s)]
*  what they call the mostasafin, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=465.29999999999995s)]
*  which is the downtrodden, the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=466.94s)]
*  wretched of the earth, the poor, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  that the state should represent [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=472.23999999999995s)]
*  them. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=473.84s)]
*  So if you look at their rhetoric, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=474.38s)]
*  it's actually, it sounds very [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  radical. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=478.78s)]
*  And in some ways, they were [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  trying to compete and outdo the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=481.58s)]
*  left on basically social [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=484.2s)]
*  radicalism. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=487.0s)]
*  And they end up defeating the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  left, because you have the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=489.64s)]
*  Mujahideen, which is somewhat of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  a left wing, right? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=491.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=493.04s)]
*  Anti-Shah party. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=493.68s)]
*  And then you have the clerics, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=494.88s)]
*  the mullahs. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=496.54s)]
*  And they, the mullahs and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=497.68s)]
*  clerics, end up taking over this [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=499.08s)]
*  revolution. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=500.98s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=501.68s)]
*  Well, I think the clerics in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=503.02s)]
*  some ways had much more social [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=504.76s)]
*  support. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=507.46000000000004s)]
*  The Mujahideen had a lot of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=508.2s)]
*  support in the high schools and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=509.92s)]
*  in the universities. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  But the clerics, their rhetoric [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=513.88s)]
*  appealed to the poor, especially [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=518.88s)]
*  urban poor or recent arrivals [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=522.8199999999999s)]
*  from the villages. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  They had mosques, which is an [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=526.76s)]
*  informal network that existed, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=529.0999999999999s)]
*  and there's no way the secret [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=531.5s)]
*  police on the Saba could have [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=532.8s)]
*  really disbanded the mosques. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=534.4s)]
*  But also there's the fact that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=537.0999999999999s)]
*  they, although the language was [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=538.6999999999999s)]
*  rhetorically very radical, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=541.8s)]
*  Khomeini and his ideology very [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=545.3399999999999s)]
*  much had roots in the Petit [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  Bourgeoisie, the middle class of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=552.1s)]
*  the bazaar. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=554.14s)]
*  So these are very, you can say, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=555.52s)]
*  traditional shopkeepers, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=558.22s)]
*  merchants, small entrepreneurs [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=560.42s)]
*  that are located in the bazaar. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=563.98s)]
*  They have very close networks, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  and they have very strong ethics [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=568.3s)]
*  about Islam and social justice. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=570.28s)]
*  And Khomeini's basically theology [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=573.78s)]
*  appealed to that base. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=577.8199999999999s)]
*  And they had a great deal of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=579.36s)]
*  money, actually, so they were [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=580.92s)]
*  able to finance the revolution. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=582.52s)]
*  And Savak, the secret police [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=584.9s)]
*  under the Shah, to what extent [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=587.2s)]
*  did that cause resentment that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=589.8s)]
*  eventually exploded? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=592.2s)]
*  Obviously the oppression created [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=595.04s)]
*  resentment. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=597.66s)]
*  It was a period, actually, in the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=600.66s)]
*  70s, there's a lot of literature [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=602.5s)]
*  you just couldn't read. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=604.86s)]
*  If you went to a secret bookstore, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=606.0s)]
*  usually the joke was, well, if [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=608.4s)]
*  you're caught with this book, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=610.04s)]
*  that'll get you five years. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=611.14s)]
*  If you get this book, ten years. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=612.74s)]
*  So it was basically the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=614.88s)]
*  bookstores could tell you how [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=616.78s)]
*  many years you would get for [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=618.34s)]
*  possessing various books. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=620.74s)]
*  So oppression was there. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=622.72s)]
*  But again, oppression is not [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=625.08s)]
*  really enough to explain a [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=627.64s)]
*  revolution. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=629.24s)]
*  We can see nowadays many [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=630.68s)]
*  countries become more oppressive, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=632.24s)]
*  but it doesn't mean that there's [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=634.68s)]

*  oppression. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=638.68s)]
*  I mean, there was torture. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=639.48s)]
*  There was fighting back. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=641.12s)]
*  Yes, there was. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=643.22s)]
*  I mean, especially this period [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=644.32s)]
*  when they started using the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=646.32s)]
*  tactics of torture to get [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=647.8s)]

*  not confessions for information, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=654.2s)]
*  but to force people to go on [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=656.16s)]
*  television and basically confess [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=658.26s)]
*  that they had made mistakes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=663.16s)]

*  prison. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  They had read books and now [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=667.14s)]

*  so on. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  That actually further alienated, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  I think, especially the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=674.68s)]
*  intelligentsia from the regime. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=675.84s)]
*  How important was the Shah to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=678.64s)]
*  America's foreign policy? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=681.22s)]

*  insist on trying to keep him? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  It mainly is due to the Nixon [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  doctrine. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=689.3399999999999s)]
*  After Vietnam, Nixon had the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=690.02s)]
*  notion that basically the U.S. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=693.18s)]
*  was overstretched and needed to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=696.8199999999999s)]
*  outsource its basically power. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=700.52s)]
*  And the obvious, from Nixon's [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  point, the obvious person to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=707.06s)]

*  Gulf, especially when Britain [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=711.3s)]
*  decided to move out of east of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=713.2s)]
*  Suez. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=716.6s)]
*  The Shah then quickly said, you [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=718.0400000000001s)]
*  know, I will be the person. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=719.6800000000001s)]

*  you, the U.S. basically sold the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  Shah whatever weapons they [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=727.46s)]
*  wanted. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  Even though a lot of people in [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=730.86s)]
*  the Pentagon State Department [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=732.26s)]
*  said this was not a good idea, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=733.96s)]
*  but there was an ongoing debate. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=735.6s)]
*  In this debate, I would say the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=737.6600000000001s)]
*  business community sided with [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=739.9000000000001s)]
*  the Shah, give him whatever he [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=742.0s)]
*  wants. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=744.34s)]
*  So another aspect of the, I [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=746.84s)]
*  think, the business community [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=751.38s)]
*  supporting the Shah was that you [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=754.52s)]
*  don't interfere or meddle too [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=756.42s)]
*  much in Iranian politics. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=759.62s)]
*  You don't talk to opposition [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=761.92s)]
*  figures. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=763.52s)]
*  You basically write reports that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=765.32s)]
*  everything is fine. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=767.52s)]
*  The Shah knows what he's doing. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=769.36s)]
*  You don't even check into [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  internal politics to see what's [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=774.9200000000001s)]
*  going on. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  So when the revolution started, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=778.0s)]
*  the U.S. embassy and the CIA [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=780.3000000000001s)]
*  were really taken short because [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=782.4000000000001s)]
*  they really didn't know who was [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=784.3000000000001s)]
*  who. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  For years they had been told not [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  to talk to people. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  You were in exile, I know, when [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=790.82s)]
*  the Ayatollah Khomeini returns to [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=793.22s)]
*  Iran. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=796.02s)]
*  But describe to me what that was [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=797.02s)]
*  like in Iran and what that meant. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=799.22s)]
*  I think the Shah then was like a [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=802.56s)]
*  charismatic figure. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=804.56s)]
*  I don't think it was his person. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=806.56s)]
*  It's the situation that created [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=809.56s)]
*  the charisma. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=811.56s)]
*  But when he returned, literally [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=813.56s)]
*  millions, I think something like [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=815.56s)]
*  an estimated 3 million people [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=817.56s)]
*  came into the streets to greet [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=819.58s)]
*  him. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=821.58s)]
*  It was really basically outpouring. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=823.58s)]
*  And it was like a messiah [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=825.58s)]
*  returning. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=827.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=829.58s)]
*  Because he was a symbol of a [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=832.4000000000001s)]
*  revolution. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=834.4000000000001s)]

*  often spoke in Persian that the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=848.4200000000001s)]

*  life, so he wasn't identified [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=854.4200000000001s)]

*  superhuman person who would come [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=867.3000000000001s)]

*  When the students took over, they [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=898.16s)]

*  In other words, not had [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=953.88s)]
*  an Islamic republic with [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=955.88s)]
*  clerical oversight. So how did we [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=957.88s)]
*  end up getting all of those? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=959.88s)]
*  Well, the hostage crisis helped that. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=961.88s)]
*  In the height of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=963.88s)]
*  the hostage crisis, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=965.88s)]
*  Khomeini dragged it out, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=967.88s)]
*  there was always then the image [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=969.88s)]
*  the U.S. is going to attack, the U.S. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=971.88s)]
*  is the imminent enemy. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=973.88s)]
*  There was attempt, of course, to rescue [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=975.88s)]
*  the hostages. In that [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=977.88s)]
*  context, then they took [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=979.88s)]
*  the document to the public and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=981.88s)]
*  said, you're going to vote for this [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=983.88s)]
*  Constitution, or if you voted against [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=985.88s)]
*  it, it was like going against the country [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=987.88s)]
*  supporting the United States. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=989.88s)]
*  So that even the people who'd written [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=991.88s)]
*  the original constitution, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=993.88s)]
*  Bazar Ghan, ended up having to [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=995.88s)]
*  vote for the clerical Constitution, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=997.88s)]
*  because they didn't want to be labeled [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=999.88s)]
*  as pro-American. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1001.88s)]
*  There's some lessons for today, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1003.88s)]
*  of course, which is that if we give [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1005.88s)]
*  an excuse to demonize the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1007.88s)]
*  United States, the hardliners [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1009.88s)]
*  take that and run with it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1011.88s)]
*  That's what happens in 79. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1013.88s)]
*  It's what's happening today. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1015.88s)]
*  It actually will happen very much [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1017.88s)]
*  next month, because Iran [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1019.88s)]
*  is about to have [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1021.88s)]
*  parliamentary elections in February. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1023.88s)]
*  And I'm sure [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1025.88s)]
*  they will use [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1027.88s)]
*  this issue, the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1029.88s)]
*  right-wing populists, to appeal [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1031.88s)]
*  to the public that the country [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1033.88s)]
*  is still in mortal danger. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1035.88s)]
*  You have to vote for tough guys, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1037.88s)]
*  and they might [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1039.88s)]
*  very well sweep the parliamentary [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1041.88s)]
*  elections. Then you're going to have a [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1043.88s)]
*  government that's much more hardlined [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1045.88s)]
*  than the present [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1047.88s)]
*  Rouhani government. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1049.88s)]
*  Professor, thank you so much. Thank you very much. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1051.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVlV4PAAE8E&t=1061.88s)]
