Video Description: Dozens of explosions sounded tonight across Israel as Iran targeted the country with a missile attack. In a statement, Iran's Revolutionary Guard said the attack was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as the assassinations of the leader of Hamas in Tehran and an IRGC official in Beirut. A U.S. Defense official says American forces in the Middle East are "currently defending against Iranian-launched missiles targeting Israel.” This attack came on the very same day that Israel launched a ground offensive into Lebanon. Escalating attacks there have already cost more than 1,000 lives and displaced more than one million Lebanese in the past few days alone. Just before Iran fired on Israel, Christiane spoke with Lebanon’s Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib.

**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU)
*  Just before Iran fired on Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=0.0s)]
*  I spoke with Lebanon's foreign minister, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=2.44s)]
*  Abdullah Abu Habib, who's in Washington [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=4.7s)]
*  to meet with American officials, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=7.34s)]
*  and he joined us for his first interview [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=9.1s)]
*  since the latest escalations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=11.38s)]
*  Foreign Minister, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=14.52s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=17.02s)]
*  Things have reached a major crisis in your country [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=18.62s)]
*  since we last spoke, and I want to ask you, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=21.02s)]
*  you are in the United States right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=23.56s)]
*  You know that several of the administration officials [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=26.2s)]
*  agree with Israel's, you know, ground incursion [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=29.66s)]
*  into your country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=34.66s)]
*  What do you make of that as you're in Washington [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=36.3s)]
*  trying to get support for a ceasefire? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=38.76s)]
*  Well, they also agreed on the, you know, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=42.0s)]
*  the Biden-Macron statement that calls for a ceasefire, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=46.0s)]
*  and that calls also the implementation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=52.32s)]
*  for 21-day ceasefire, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  and then Mr. Rokhstein would go to Lebanon [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=57.88s)]
*  and negotiate a ceasefire, okay? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  And they told us that Mr. Netanyahu agreed on this, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=64.42s)]
*  and so we also got the agreement of Hezbollah on that, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=68.92s)]
*  and you know what happened since then. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=72.52s)]
*  That was the day we saw you in New York. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=74.92s)]
*  I know, and you were talking about going into [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=78.26s)]
*  the Security Council for this ceasefire, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=80.9s)]
*  and barely 24 hours later, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=83.54s)]
*  the head of Hezbollah was assassinated. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=86.42s)]
*  Are you saying Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a ceasefire [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=88.7s)]
*  just moments before he was assassinated? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=92.34s)]
*  He agreed, he agreed, yes, yes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=95.0s)]
*  We agreed completely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  but consulting with Hezbollah, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=102.04s)]
*  the speaker, Mr. Birri, consulted with Hezbollah, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=105.28s)]
*  and we informed the Americans and the French [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  that what happened. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=112.42s)]
*  And they told us that Mr. Netanyahu also agreed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=114.84s)]
*  on the statement that was issued by both presidents. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=119.1s)]
*  Okay, well, as you know, Mr. Netanyahu was also [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=122.84s)]
*  in New York at the time, and he actually said publicly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=125.48s)]
*  the IDF must fight on, and then he ordered [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=128.82s)]
*  the assassination and the targeting of that headquarters [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=132.08s)]
*  which killed Nasrallah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=135.62s)]
*  So given all of that, I mean, who do you have any faith [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=139.82s)]
*  in if the strongest country in the world, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=145.74s)]
*  the United States, seems to have no or very little influence [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  after publicly saying that there would be a ceasefire? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=153.88s)]
*  I don't think we have an alternative, yes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=155.68s)]
*  I don't think we have an alternative. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=159.98s)]
*  We need the United States' help. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  Whether we get it or not, we are not sure yet, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=166.52s)]
*  but United States is very important vital for the ceasefire [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=169.16s)]
*  if it has to happen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=173.22s)]
*  The United States is always important in this regard. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=175.61999999999998s)]
*  So what do you make then of the United States' [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  latest warnings to the region and now publicly [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=182.1s)]
*  that they have intelligence that Iran is preparing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=185.76s)]
*  an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=189.7s)]
*  What will that do for the situation? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=195.92s)]
*  Well, we always warned against a regional war. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=197.88s)]
*  That will draw United States into it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=203.66s)]
*  And we thought that what Israel did would produce that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Until now, nothing had happened, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=213.76s)]
*  but the issue is that that's what they hear. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=216.2s)]
*  We didn't hear it directly from the Iranian, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=220.0s)]
*  but that's what we hear from the news today, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=224.2s)]
*  what you said about Iran ballistic missiles [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=226.1s)]
*  fired to Israel or to be fired. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=229.94s)]
*  So my question to you is, because others have said this, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=233.32s)]
*  I want to know whether you agree, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=236.28s)]
*  that Benjamin Netanyahu has succeeded [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  in creating the kind of dynamic that he wants [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=242.16s)]
*  on the ground and in the air, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=246.5s)]
*  and could possibly succeed in getting the United States [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=248.44s)]
*  to help Israel strike Iran. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=254.0s)]
*  Do you think that is what's going to happen next [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=257.06s)]
*  if Iran strikes Israel? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, he succeeded definitely. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=261.48s)]
*  He came the next day after the announcement [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=264.44s)]
*  of the Americans and the French on the ceasefire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=268.44s)]
*  He came the next day, and his ministers were saying, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=272.24s)]
*  no, we don't agree, but he didn't say anything. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=276.52s)]
*  And when he came after he spoke [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=279.4s)]
*  at the United Nations General Assembly, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=283.24s)]
*  he gave an order to hit the Hezbollah in southern Bahia. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=286.04s)]
*  And he said, no, we don't agree with the route. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=291.6s)]
*  I'm afraid that the United States is gonna help Israel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=294.52s)]
*  They have said it many times, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=299.8s)]
*  and God knows what would happen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=301.8s)]
*  Really, Christian, I don't know what's gonna happen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=304.84s)]
*  That's what we are afraid of. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1_q1vlUXU&t=308.36s)]
