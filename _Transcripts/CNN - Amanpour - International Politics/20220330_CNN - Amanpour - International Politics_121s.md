# French Pres. Macron Continues A Dialogue With Vladimir Putin | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8)
*  Your president, President Macron, has been speaking to President Putin just yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=0.0s)]
*  I think was the latest. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  What is Putin saying? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=7.36s)]
*  What does your president, what do you believe is Putin's aim right now? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=9.3s)]
*  What are his demands right now? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=12.94s)]
*  I do not know what is the goal of President Putin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=15.18s)]
*  What I am aware of is that President Macron speaks to President Putin on a regular basis, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=22.78s)]
*  with some sort of an observation to first of all try and lead Putin to a ceasefire and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=27.6s)]
*  next to the post and the opening of genuine negotiations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=33.96s)]
*  But from the beginning of these talks, President Putin did not make a move or nothing visible, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=38.04s)]
*  including during the negotiation phases. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=45.0s)]
*  And in Istanbul, on the occasion of these negotiations, there was nothing new, no breakthrough [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  on what was discussed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=54.44s)]
*  Over three weeks already in Belarus, in Lomel or in Antalya, in Turkey, the issues are still the same. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=56.4s)]
*  And on the Mary, well, it doesn't seem that President Putin has changed in a way, shape or form. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=65.24s)]
*  He still wishes to impose his tic tac on Ukraine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=70.2s)]
*  And what is new in the talks in Istanbul is that it's been made public. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=73.72s)]
*  On the other hand, I would like to note that President Zelenskyy has made some openings, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=80.52s)]
*  particularly regarding the equality of Ukraine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=84.72s)]
*  But in parallel, he also wants with some security guarantees to be given to his country. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=87.28s)]
*  And at the moment, there is nothing like that in the discussions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=92.44s)]
*  So, yes, there are ongoing talks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=95.4s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=97.24s)]
*  There is no breakthrough. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=98.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, the priority for a ceasefire and the utmost priority is on the lifting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=99.84s)]
*  of the siege of Mariupol. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5dD27tmxj8&t=104.96s)]
