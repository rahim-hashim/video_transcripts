# Matthew Chance Encounters Russian Troops in Kyiv | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY)
*  Matthew, that was some drama there, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=0.0s)]
*  and you came face to face with the airborne paratroopers. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=2.2s)]
*  What transpired from that encounter, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=5.8s)]
*  and what more can you tell us about, you know, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=8.6s)]
*  the encirclement of the capital where you are? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=11.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, it was an unexpected encounter, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=15.6s)]
*  I can tell you that, Christiane, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=18.6s)]
*  because we were proceeding towards that air base [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=19.6s)]
*  which we knew had been the scene of some fighting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  between Russian airborne troops and Ukrainian forces, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=25.6s)]
*  but we'd been told by Ukrainian officials [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=28.6s)]
*  that the air base was back in Ukrainian government control, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  so we went there anyway to the gates, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=34.4s)]
*  there were soldiers at the gates directing traffic away, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=37.0s)]
*  and I went up to them and I said, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=39.6s)]
*  look, can we do a quick live shot outside here, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=40.6s)]
*  a quick report on CNN? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  And they were like, no, no, it's far, far too dangerous, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=44.8s)]
*  remember, this was in broken Russian we were speaking in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=47.0s)]
*  And I said, look, who's in control of this airport, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=50.8s)]
*  is it the Russians or the Ukrainians? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=53.6s)]
*  And they said, what do you mean? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=54.8s)]
*  And I said, who is it, who's in control? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=56.2s)]
*  And they said, it's the Russians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=58.2s)]
*  And I said to them, where are the Russians? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=59.6s)]
*  And they said, well, we are the Russians. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=62.2s)]
*  And it was only at that point that I looked down [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=64.8s)]
*  at their insignia and realized that these were [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=67.4s)]
*  the special forces, the airborne troops that had been sent in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=69.4s)]
*  by Vladimir Putin to secure that air base a few hours before [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=72.8s)]
*  and had fought off a defense of it [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=76.4s)]
*  by the Ukrainian military forces there [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  and had pushed them right back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=81.0s)]
*  You know, you saw some video, you just played there [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  of a firefight that broke out in the minutes after we spoke, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=84.4s)]
*  we took cover obviously, and caught that glimpse, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  did that live report with those Russian troops, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=91.4s)]
*  the first glimpse that we've had of them basically, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  face to face in this massive nationwide deployment. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=97.0s)]
*  It's not just there, their base as well, Christiane, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=101.2s)]
*  they're based in other places, there are units like that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=103.2s)]
*  at airstrips at other places and strategic locations [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  around the Ukrainian capital. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  And of course it raises the concern that what's happening here [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=111.4s)]
*  is that Russian forces are surrounding this city. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=115.2s)]
*  In fact, that's what Ukrainian officials say [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=119.0s)]
*  that they now fear within days that could happen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  They say the plan they fear, according to Ukrainian officials, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=123.0s)]
*  is that Vladimir Putin is gonna come in, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=126.0s)]
*  he's gonna topple the leadership here [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=128.0s)]
*  and he is going to install a pro-Russian government. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=130.0s)]
*  That's what their concern is tonight. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=132.8s)]
*  Yes, and we've heard that from international officials as well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=135.0s)]
*  And just briefly before I let you go, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=138.4s)]
*  hearing nothing more tonight, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=140.6s)]
*  I mean, you might be hearing something [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=142.4s)]
*  in the overnight hours, but right now, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=144.2s)]
*  is it quiet where you are? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=146.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not, it's quiet in the sense [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=149.0s)]
*  there are no big explosions behind us, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  but I'm hearing jets in the sky, not right now, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  but over the past couple of minutes, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  I've been hearing jets pass overhead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=156.0s)]
*  I'm assuming they're Russian jets [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=158.0s)]
*  because the Ukrainians just don't have that capability. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  And not only that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=162.0s)]
*  Let's see what the coming hours bring. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the Russians, we're told, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=164.6s)]
*  have total superiority of the air right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  Matthew, thank you so much. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=170.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCRLawN5KfY&t=174.2s)]
