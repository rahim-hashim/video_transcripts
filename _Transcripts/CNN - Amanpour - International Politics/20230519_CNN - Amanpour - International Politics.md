# WWII Historian Says G7 Leaders Need to Remember the Lessons of Hiroshima  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00)
*  Now, Hiroshima, the site of the G7 summit, is the most powerful reminder of the total [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=0.0s)]
*  catastrophe of nuclear weapons, which are often bandied about these days as a legitimate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  battlefield weapon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=11.56s)]
*  In his new book, Evan Thomas concludes, the United States had no other option than to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=13.18s)]
*  drop the atomic bombs on Japan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=18.42s)]
*  It is controversial, as he tells Walter Isaacson. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=20.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=24.42s)]
*  And, Evan Thomas, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=25.42s)]
*  Great to be back. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=27.42s)]
*  Your book, The Road to Surrender, comes out this week and is about the decisions that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=29.62s)]
*  led to the dropping of the atom bomb in Hiroshima. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=33.5s)]
*  And it's sort of a reminder about why we shouldn't put statesmen in that position. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=36.82s)]
*  Tell me about the G7 meeting in Hiroshima and what it means to you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=42.08s)]
*  Well, I hope it's a reminder to the statesmen there that they never want to back themselves [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=47.24s)]
*  into the kind of corner we were in in August of 1945, when really there was no choice but [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=52.06s)]
*  to use these terrible weapons. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=59.58s)]
*  I know there's been a lot of argument over the years, but in my book, I think I make [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=60.98s)]
*  a pretty compelling case that really we were stuck. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=66.38s)]
*  The Japanese would not surrender. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=69.22s)]
*  To end this terrible, terrible war, we had to use not one, but two nuclear weapons. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=71.82s)]
*  And that was a terrible thing for the world and for the people who had to use them, never [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=78.5s)]
*  recovered from it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=83.64s)]
*  And I spent a lot of time in the book talking about the agonies they went through as they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=85.16s)]
*  faced this moral and political dilemma about whether to use these things when there really [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=91.08s)]
*  was not a good choice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=97.54s)]
*  Your book's theme is moral ambiguity. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=99.76s)]
*  And we live in an age of Twitter in which nothing is morally ambiguous. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  People leap to one side or the other. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=108.32s)]
*  And we're seeing that even in foreign policy today, even with China. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=110.8s)]
*  Are you worried that we're marching down a path where we're putting people into a position [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=114.76s)]
*  where it's perhaps more likely that the bomb would be used again? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=119.28s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=123.12s)]
*  As you say, we live in this world now of kind of moral righteousness. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=125.84s)]
*  You know, when people have these Twitter debates or debates on the Internet or anywhere, I'm [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=129.0s)]
*  right, you're wrong. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=134.12s)]
*  Not only are you wrong, you're morally inferior to me or to my group. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=135.96s)]
*  And that's a bad culture that we're in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=141.44s)]
*  And you can see it play out on the world stage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=144.24s)]
*  Putin is a kind of crazy moralist. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a twisted Russian morality. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  But he's, you know, I'm moral and the other side is evil. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=153.76s)]
*  And he's backing himself into a corner where he may have to act on that to save his own [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=158.26s)]
*  crazy notions of his own morality. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=163.4s)]
*  Even more dangerous, I think, is the corner we're getting into with China. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=166.8s)]
*  China is, you know, China is building missile fields as we speak. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=172.4s)]
*  We thought the arms race was over. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=175.68s)]
*  We thought we were out of the nuclear age. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=177.86s)]
*  The Chinese are building ICBM fields and we're going to be back into into a scary standoff [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=180.18s)]
*  with another nuclear armed power. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=188.88s)]
*  I hope that we take lessons from the past about why it's not simple. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=191.16s)]
*  It's not I'm right, you're wrong, but that statesmen have got to work together to avoid [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=198.12s)]
*  getting to the brink. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=202.68s)]
*  But we're not even having nuclear arms control talks with the Chinese now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=204.04s)]
*  And the Russians have pulled out of most of the nuclear arms agreements that we talked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=208.06s)]
*  about. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=213.0s)]
*  Is that sort of an example of the fact that everybody has gotten onto a righteous high [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=214.0s)]
*  horse and we're not able to do the normal things that people expected after Hiroshima [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  of preventing this bomb from being used again? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=225.16s)]
*  Well, the rhetoric is all high horse. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=227.28s)]
*  I mean, if you just read what Putin says or what the Chinese say, it's all kind of adjuvant. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=229.68s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's way out there and denouncing us as being wicked and evil. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=235.72s)]
*  Now, you hope that they may be talking that way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=241.24s)]
*  But behind the scenes, there are diplomats who are having realistic discussions with [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=244.32s)]
*  them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=250.28s)]
*  There's a little bit of a sign of that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=251.28s)]
*  I think Nick Burns, Ambassador Nick Burns was recently in China. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=252.28s)]
*  And there is actually an opening here for for the world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=255.88s)]
*  And that is in Ukraine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=259.76s)]
*  If we if the Chinese could only persuade Russia to stand down and if the United States by [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=261.64s)]
*  the same token could help Ukraine stand down, we could find a diplomatic ending to a war [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  in which people are otherwise backing themselves into a situation where Putin could use a nuke. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=277.44s)]
*  So that's there's a little glimmer of hope to me that statesmen could be wise about this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=283.4s)]
*  and find a way out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=288.52s)]
*  But it it really doesn't help if you're posturing all the time about how you're morally superior [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=290.32s)]
*  to the other side. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  You say that it's possible that Vladimir Putin could use a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=298.6s)]
*  What do you think would drive him to that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=303.72s)]
*  And what should we be doing? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=305.72s)]
*  I think if he feels that he's losing and that he's going to be deposed himself and and he [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=306.72s)]
*  has no other choice but to use a nuke. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=314.36s)]
*  Now, I think it's a horrific choice. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=317.36s)]
*  And I think the Chinese would try to talk him out of it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=319.68s)]
*  But it's possible. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=322.52s)]
*  His rhetoric is crazy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=323.52s)]
*  And he likes to rattle the nuclear weapon, rattle the nuclear saber. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  He does it all. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=331.0s)]
*  They do it all the time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=332.0s)]
*  And they're always making references saying, well, the United States, he says, you did [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=333.0s)]
*  it first. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  You did Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not us. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  And so he's trying to put us to morally backfoot us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=342.56s)]
*  And that in the real world, and I hope Putin reads my book, because in the real world, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=346.72s)]
*  these decisions are difficult. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  They're not ideological. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=355.56s)]
*  We did use those weapons, but we use them only after we realized that there was no other [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=358.12s)]
*  choice to use them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=363.36s)]
*  There's a movie coming out called Oppenheimer. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=365.16s)]
*  And there's a scene, which they probably have in the movie, where after we drop the atom [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=368.04s)]
*  bomb, Oppenheimer, the scientist who helped create the atom bomb, comes into Harry Truman's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=372.92s)]
*  office, President Truman's office, the Oval Office, saying, I have blood on my hands. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  And Truman kicks him out and says, I don't want to see that crybaby ever again. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=384.24s)]
*  Now, Truman was posturing a little bit when he was doing that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=388.76s)]
*  But the point is, you know, you have to make these terrible decisions and then you have [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=392.32s)]
*  to live with them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=396.32s)]
*  And my book is about people who had to live with terrible decisions. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=398.0s)]
*  That's that's that is the real world. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=401.32s)]
*  With Biden going to Hiroshima and the Oppenheimer movie coming out, we're all reminded of these [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=404.44s)]
*  things again. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  One thing that Oppenheimer said as he was agonizing after the bomb was used is that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  possibly the use of the bomb would make sure we never used it again. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=418.16s)]
*  Tell me about that line of thinking. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=423.8s)]
*  Oppenheimer's own scientists were appalled by what they were about to do. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  And Oppenheimer calmed them down by saying, look, if we use this thing, it'll be so horrific [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=430.0s)]
*  that we'll never do it again. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  War will be over. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=438.48s)]
*  And, you know, for a long time, it looked like he was wrong about that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=440.68s)]
*  I mean, we had a huge arms race, but actually there was a taboo. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=444.08s)]
*  The people who use those weapons were shocked by it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=450.03999999999996s)]
*  And I wrote a book about President Eisenhower, and he was pretty determined never to use [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=453.03999999999996s)]
*  those weapons again. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  I fear that with a passage of a half a century, more 70 years now, people forget how terrible [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  they are. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=466.24s)]
*  They are terrible. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=467.52s)]
*  The average ICBM nuclear warhead is 100 times more powerful than the atom bomb that fell [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=469.52s)]
*  on Hiroshima, 100 times or 200 times. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=477.6s)]
*  Hiroshima is taken out of Midtown Manhattan. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=481.04s)]
*  An H-bomb is all five boroughs. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's the whole damn thing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=487.76s)]
*  And the nuclear taboo worked for a very long time, partly because statesmen did avoid [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=490.48s)]
*  pressing the button and because there's some arms control. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=498.88s)]
*  We need to get back into a world in which we're talking to each other again about arms [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  control and about how incredibly dangerous these things are. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=506.56s)]
*  But I fear we forget. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=510.84s)]
*  You say people's memories are fading. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=512.64s)]
*  Is this going to be a spur to say, oh, yes, let's make sure we get back into arms control [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=515.12s)]
*  and other discussions? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=520.28s)]
*  You know, the whole reason why statesmen meet is to have these kind of conversations, off-the-record [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=521.9599999999999s)]
*  conversations, so they're not just yelling at each other through their spokesman. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=526.92s)]
*  So I sure hope they talk about that because it has immediate relevance. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=530.5999999999999s)]
*  Ukraine has got to be resolved before Putin fires off one of these things. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=534.68s)]
*  And then right over the horizon, the fate of Taiwan is bringing the United States and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  China into a nuclear standoff. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=545.68s)]
*  If we fight China over Taiwan, there's a very good chance we will use missiles against the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Chinese mainland. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=555.8s)]
*  And China will want to use missiles against our mainland. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=558.4s)]
*  Once countriesâ€”this is not some nice little 19th century sea battle. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=561.2s)]
*  This is an intercontinental conflict. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  And that runs the risk of using nuclear weapons. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=568.76s)]
*  We've been there in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=571.84s)]
*  We need to go back and relive some of that history to remember just how terrible it was, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=576.84s)]
*  howâ€”what a close thing it was. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=581.4s)]
*  That's another thing that people don't quite realize. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=583.6s)]
*  We almost used a third bomb. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=587.6s)]
*  In my book, I write about Harry Truman told the British ambassador they were running out [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=589.84s)]
*  of time and they were going to use a third bomb on Tokyo. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=594.32s)]
*  People don't realize that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=597.76s)]
*  That's how close it was. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=598.96s)]
*  There was a coup d'etat attempt in the Imperial Palace on the last night to try to disrupt [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=600.44s)]
*  the surrender. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=606.76s)]
*  People forget all about that, but that's how close it came to us using a third weapon. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=607.76s)]
*  And they were planning for a sixth, seventh. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=612.84s)]
*  They were planning to drop bombs all fall along. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  We don't want to be in that position. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  Your book has some really great inside reporting about a lot of the major players, General [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=621.08s)]
*  Spade, Colonel Stimson, whoâ€”Secretary of War, but mainly from inside the Japanese Imperial [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=627.4s)]
*  Court. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=634.28s)]
*  Tell me what you learned there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=635.88s)]
*  Well, the Japanese were determined to die. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=638.32s)]
*  After we had dropped two atom bombs on them, there's a meeting of the Supreme War Council, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  the guys who really run Japan, and the Minister of War says, wouldn't it be wonderful to [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  die like cherry blossoms? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=653.2s)]
*  The whole nation. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=655.2800000000001s)]
*  There's a deadlock. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=656.2800000000001s)]
*  They can't decide. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=658.9200000000001s)]
*  Finally, the emperor, partly because he's afraid there's an atom bomb about to drop [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  on him, correctly afraid of it, he puts an end to it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  But it takes another five days. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  There's a coup attempt. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=668.6400000000001s)]
*  These cultures can kind of go mad. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=671.2s)]
*  The Japanese culture at that time did go mad. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, fortunately, there are human beings involved, and I write about it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=677.96s)]
*  Japanese Foreign Minister, a guy named Shigenori Togo, nobody's ever heard of him. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=681.9200000000001s)]
*  He was sentenced as a war criminal to 20 years, but he saved millions of lives because he [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=685.88s)]
*  was a human being. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=691.6s)]
*  He was a Japanese who'd read Goethe. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=692.6s)]
*  He read German philosophers. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=694.84s)]
*  He was a humanist. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  He saw that we had to surrender. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=700.2s)]
*  The Japanese had to surrender. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=703.04s)]
*  He persuaded the emperor, explicitly persuaded the emperor, as the emperor says, I agree [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  with the foreign minister, and he ends it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=709.04s)]
*  But it took that kind of human courage, humanistic courage, from somebody who'd read history, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=711.76s)]
*  he was a Japanese foreign minister, but he's anti-Nazi. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=720.24s)]
*  He wanted to bring back the Germany of the 19th century. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=724.16s)]
*  He'd read history, and he understood humanity. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=727.2800000000001s)]
*  And fortunately, there were just enough people like that in the Japanese government to end [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=729.84s)]
*  the war. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=735.5200000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, that damn war would have gone on and on, and millions would have died. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=736.5200000000001s)]
*  And the other great interesting character in your book, or one of the others, is, of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=740.12s)]
*  course, Henry Stemson, who is also a humanist, but a very much of a realist, too, a realist [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=744.0400000000001s)]
*  who's trying to balance realism and idealism. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=751.5200000000001s)]
*  Tell me about his conflicts. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  That is American foreign policy in a nutshell. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=756.6s)]
*  The United States is a humane country. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=759.9599999999999s)]
*  We're not imperialist. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=762.12s)]
*  We believe in democracy and human rights. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=764.28s)]
*  But to make that work, you have to use power. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=766.56s)]
*  You have to be both a realist and an idealist. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  That was Henry Stemson. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=772.4399999999999s)]
*  He's sort of the godfather, forgotten now, but he was the godfather of American foreign [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  policy all through the Cold War. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=777.36s)]
*  That combination of trying to do the right thing, of trying to spread democracy, but [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=779.18s)]
*  at the same time, realizing that you had to exercise power and not back away from [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=784.12s)]
*  hard challenges. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=789.52s)]
*  Now, Henry Kissinger understood that, people, but the guy who started this was a guy named [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=790.72s)]
*  Henry Stimson, and he was 77 years old. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=796.64s)]
*  He was agonized by it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  He had, on the day, and this is in my book, on the day he shows Truman the photographs [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  of the destruction of Hiroshima, he has a heart attack. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=806.6s)]
*  A month later, when he's trying to get arms control going, he has another heart attack. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=809.76s)]
*  He can't sleep. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=814.84s)]
*  He's agonized. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=816.2s)]
*  This is not something he's calm about. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=817.2s)]
*  This is tearing him up inside, because there is a conflict between realism and idealism. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=819.24s)]
*  It's hard to do both. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=824.4s)]
*  What role did denial, self-denial, and misinformation play in the decisions leading up to the dropping [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=825.96s)]
*  of the bomb? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=833.7s)]
*  You know, we like to think that when people make a tough decision, they have a very full [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=835.34s)]
*  and considerate debate over it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=838.86s)]
*  That's not the way it really works. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=841.58s)]
*  There's a lot of denial, people not wanting to know. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=843.4200000000001s)]
*  On the night that Harry Truman gave the decision to drop the atom bomb, he wrote in his diary, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=845.94s)]
*  I have instructed the Secretary of War to choose a purely military target so that we [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=852.1s)]
*  kill soldiers and not women and children. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=857.1s)]
*  Nonsense. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=860.46s)]
*  The bomb was aimed at the heart of Hiroshima. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=861.86s)]
*  But Truman just didn't want to believe what he was about to do. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=864.38s)]
*  It's human. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=868.62s)]
*  People just have a hard time facing what they're doing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=869.62s)]
*  But he did it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=874.66s)]
*  He did give the order. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=875.82s)]
*  He may have had some denial in his diary, but he made the tough decision. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=876.82s)]
*  Was he right? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=881.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=883.06s)]
*  Your book takes on what was called the revisionist school of history, which among other things [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=884.78s)]
*  said we were wrong to drop the atom bomb. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=891.46s)]
*  We could have won the war without dropping the bomb. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=894.0s)]
*  We did it maybe to scare Russia off that we had all sorts of ulterior motives. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=897.6s)]
*  First of all, explain to me why that revisionist theory was wrong. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=902.76s)]
*  I would like to be for the revisionists. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=907.24s)]
*  And believe me, the people who dropped the bomb didn't want to drop it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=909.12s)]
*  But it assumes that Japanese would be willing to surrender. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=912.16s)]
*  If we just said, you can keep your emperor, no. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=914.96s)]
*  The facts are otherwise. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=918.32s)]
*  And I know this from reading Japanese diaries and the record. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  And I spent a long time talking to the grandsons of my hero. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=925.04s)]
*  And they gave you some of the diaries to the grandchildren. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=929.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  It's just obvious from the contemporaneous record, not later, but what was happening [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Am1fDLmk00&t=934.68s)]
