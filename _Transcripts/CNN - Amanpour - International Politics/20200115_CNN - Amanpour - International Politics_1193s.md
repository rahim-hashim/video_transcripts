# Bernard-Henri Lévy Went to the Front Lines of the Fight Against ISIS  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q)
*  Now, all the way on the other side of the spectrum, the other big story of these past [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  weeks, of course, has been the threat of war between Iran and the United States. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=4.48s)]
*  And our next guest says, leave the Middle East at your peril. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=8.36s)]
*  The French philosopher Bernard Henry Levy has gone to the front lines of the fight against [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=12.4s)]
*  ISIS alongside Kurdish fighters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=17.02s)]
*  And in two documentaries, Peshmerga and the Battle of Mosul, he paints the story of a [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=19.82s)]
*  people constantly abandoned by the West while still always helping fight for our shared [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=25.24s)]
*  values and causes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=30.64s)]
*  And he tells Harris Sreenivasan ISIS is regrouping. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=32.32s)]
*  I know you have a group of films that you're screening and the ones about the Kurds and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=37.16s)]
*  the Peshmerga are of interest in this conversation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=42.04s)]
*  First for our audience, remind us who the Peshmerga are. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=45.0s)]
*  Peshmerga, they are the Kurdish fighters from Iraqi Kurdistan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=48.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=54.16s)]
*  Those who did fight against ISIS from 2014 to 2018, who took Mosul and who defeated ISIS. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=55.16s)]
*  Those in other words, who were our boots on the ground in Iraq and in all the area. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=68.28s)]
*  Those are the Peshmerga. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Literally it means those who face death. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=78.36s)]
*  Those are the Peshmerga. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=81.76s)]
*  Those are those whom I followed for a month in order to shoot and to direct this movie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=83.76s)]
*  Why make the film in the first place? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=91.68s)]
*  Why go and be on the ground with them in a month going from battle to battle? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  It was at the peak of the triumph of ISIS, July 2015. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=98.24s)]
*  We were in France. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=107.36s)]
*  We received some huge terrorist attacks like you did in America September 11, 14 years [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=109.8s)]
*  before. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=116.72s)]
*  I knew that we were defenseless in a way against these terrorists and that there was a people, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=118.56s)]
*  the Kurds, who were defending us and who were doing that with loyalty, professionalism and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  a great amount of courage. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=134.76s)]
*  So I thought that the least we could do, journalists, politicians or public intellectuals, was to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=136.32s)]
*  try at least to understand, to try at least to convey their message. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=145.4s)]
*  I felt challenged by their courage and by their devotion to the Western values. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=150.76s)]
*  It's not so frequent today in the Muslim world, apart a people who is 100% devoted to equality [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=159.04s)]
*  between genders, rights of women, secularism, pro-West inclination, protection of the minorities, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=169.52s)]
*  Christians and Jews. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=180.32s)]
*  These are the Peshmerga. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=181.32s)]
*  There's actually a clip from the film out of Mosul that I want to play that illustrates [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=183.32s)]
*  a little bit of what you're talking about and here we see Muslim troops erecting a cross [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=187.96s)]
*  back up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=193.5s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=194.5s)]
*  I was not so surprised, but I was moved to tears, moved to tears to see these Muslim [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=240.5s)]
*  young boys taking, there was a lot of snipers still around, taking the responsibility to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=250.92s)]
*  take this cross and to put it again. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=259.24s)]
*  I was moved to tears. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=261.32s)]
*  What I must tell you is that four years after, when I learned, when I heard that President [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=263.44s)]
*  Trump decided to withdraw his troops from the area, which means to abandon, to abandon [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=271.64s)]
*  these guys to their destiny, to their destiny, I was moved to tears again, but for another [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  reason, not by emotion, but by sadness. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=288.44s)]
*  It was so, so mean. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=292.84s)]
*  And this decision to abandon the Kurds, to withdraw our troops, to leave them under the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=295.46s)]
*  grip of Erdogan and of the Iranians and of Bashar al-Assad, this was probably the biggest [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=301.88s)]
*  strategical and moral mistake of United States of America since I'm born. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=309.64s)]
*  So when I see these images again, for me, I am heartbroken. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=317.38s)]
*  How are they taking that abandonment now? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=324.04s)]
*  I mean, where do they see themselves in the longer arc? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=326.5s)]
*  Who do they ally with? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=330.82s)]
*  In this part of the world, and maybe a little more for them, loyalty has a meaning. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=332.54s)]
*  Your word is bond. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=339.48s)]
*  The word is bond, yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=340.48s)]
*  The word is sacred. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=342.96s)]
*  When you deal, you deal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=345.38s)]
*  When you give your word, you don't take it back. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=347.34s)]
*  And they took for granted the word of America. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=350.24s)]
*  They took for granted all our rhetoric about fighting shoulder to shoulder against ISIS, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=353.94s)]
*  international coalition and all of that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=361.3s)]
*  They took it for granted. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=363.86s)]
*  And when they heard that, that Trump decided all of a sudden, by a tweet, by a tweet, to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=365.56s)]
*  and to let them in the mouth of the lion, they first did not understand. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=373.82s)]
*  After that, they had to recover. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=379.14s)]
*  So some of them, the Kurds of Iraq, accepted the sort of compromise with Erdogan. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=381.46s)]
*  Others in Syria are in the process of accepting a sort of compromise with Bashar al-Assad. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=388.9s)]
*  In the two cases, it is compromise with the devil. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=396.3s)]
*  But as a great general of Syrian Kurds recently said, General Masloum Abdi Kobani, he said, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=399.74s)]
*  what do you want, Mr. Westerners? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=409.62s)]
*  We have to choose between genocide and compromise. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=411.74s)]
*  After the abandonment, after the abandonment of the West, our choice is that, genocide [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=416.5s)]
*  or compromise? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=424.5s)]
*  We choose compromise. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=425.5s)]
*  And when they see the escalation of the recent days, for example, they have no friendship [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=427.18s)]
*  for the Iranians, for example. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=435.66s)]
*  But they are afraid, because they know that they are, on all sense of the word, on front [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=437.66s)]
*  line, on front line, militarily, strategically. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  They could become the proxy war. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=450.9s)]
*  They could be parties inside Iraq in this fight between Iran and the U.S. as it plays [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=453.28s)]
*  out. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=458.76s)]
*  My companions, my friends, the Peshmerga, the ones which I know well are the Kurds of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=459.76s)]
*  Iraq, which is the Peshmerga. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=465.32s)]
*  Two years ago, after the defeat of ISIS, they organized a referendum of auto-determination. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=467.76s)]
*  And already, they were abandoned by the Americans and by the Europeans. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=475.4s)]
*  It was the Battle of Kirkuk. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=481.64000000000004s)]
*  And what happened then? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=484.48s)]
*  Some proxies of Iran, some Shia militias, the Shia militias directed by General Soleimani, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=486.0s)]
*  who was, by the way, on the battlefield against them, came to them and crushed them and took [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=492.8s)]
*  over a part of their territory with the acceptance of Americans. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=499.48s)]
*  OK, now Donald Trump says that General Soleimani was a monster. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=504.0s)]
*  But in September and October 2017, he gave to the monster part of the Kurdish territory. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=509.47999999999996s)]
*  He withdrew in front of the monster. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=517.88s)]
*  And what I saw with my eyes at this time, Battle of Kirkuk, it was Shia militias with [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=521.84s)]
*  General Soleimani in the back and with Abraham tanks delivered by America, because the Abraham [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=529.88s)]
*  tanks of America were delivered to the government of Baghdad. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=538.18s)]
*  From Baghdad, some of them went in the hands of the Shia militias. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=542.46s)]
*  And these Shia militias used your Abraham tanks in order to crash, in order to kill [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=547.42s)]
*  some valiant Kurds who had been for, since three years, your and our best allies. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=557.78s)]
*  So this war against proxies, those who are paying for it already at a high price are [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=566.54s)]
*  the Kurds. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=573.38s)]
*  So they know that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=574.7s)]
*  They know that they have in front of them proxies of Erdogan on one side, proxies of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=576.14s)]
*  Khamenei on the other side, and that when the difficulty becomes really hot, nobody [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=582.14s)]
*  to help. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=591.5s)]
*  No American soldiers, no European soldiers either. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=593.42s)]
*  No friendship except the mountains, as they say. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=597.86s)]
*  I want to play a clip from the film Peshmerga as well that just gives an illustration of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=601.62s)]
*  a little bit of the fighting that was going on and a little bit of what you witnessed. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  You spent some time with these guys. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=653.42s)]
*  You had lunch and dinner and slept and ate with these folks. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=657.62s)]
*  What is it that motivates them to get up and do this fight every day, knowing that there [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=661.02s)]
*  are bands of killers on either side, that they don't have even the bulletproof vest, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=665.62s)]
*  sometimes the air support doesn't come? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=671.78s)]
*  To defend their families, to defend their land, and to defend their principles. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=675.14s)]
*  The thing I heard most in all these months which I spent with the Kurds of Iraq is the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=681.82s)]
*  following. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=690.7800000000001s)]
*  We defend civilization. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=692.4200000000001s)]
*  We are not fighting only for ourselves, but for the rest of the world. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=694.5s)]
*  At the end of Peshmerga, of my movie, there is a very, I think, moving scene. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=698.3000000000001s)]
*  It was just before an assault against the recovery of the city of Singal, the Sinjar [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=706.06s)]
*  mountain. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  So, a very decisive moment. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=713.8199999999999s)]
*  Some of them were going to die in the next hours. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=715.5s)]
*  My simple question was, why are you fighting? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=719.38s)]
*  Two-thirds of them said, we are fighting for you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=722.9s)]
*  There are scenes where you are down in the underground bunkers of ISIS that is still [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=727.3s)]
*  lined with explosives. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=733.14s)]
*  You see the level of infrastructure here. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=736.0200000000001s)]
*  They have a newspaper that they are reading in these tunnels. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=738.0600000000001s)]
*  They have tins of food. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=741.1s)]
*  It's fairly organized. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=744.86s)]
*  Because of the retreat of the withdrawal of your country, because of the nothingness of [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=747.38s)]
*  Europe in this area, because of the dirty game of Erdogan, ISIS is reviving. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=755.0200000000001s)]
*  ISIS is coming back. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=764.6999999999999s)]
*  And I was in some places, it will be very soon in one of your dailies, my reportage, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=766.38s)]
*  my story, in some places where I got and brought back some evidence that ISIS is coming back. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=771.98s)]
*  These sort of tunnels which you are mentioning, they are digged again. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=779.26s)]
*  Or they are reopened if they had not been found by the coalition. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=785.2199999999999s)]
*  So, the game is not over. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=789.5799999999999s)]
*  Was the assassination or murder of Soleimani wise, necessary, just? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=792.42s)]
*  Wise, certainly not. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=803.02s)]
*  Certainly not. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=805.02s)]
*  There is also an art of the war. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=806.02s)]
*  War is a terrible thing, but there is an art of the war. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=810.42s)]
*  Between since Sun Tzu until Klaus Witz, there are some rules. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=813.54s)]
*  You don't escalate to the supreme degree all of a sudden. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=820.06s)]
*  So wise, certainly not. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=825.78s)]
*  He was a terrorist, no doubt. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  He was the architect of the dirty policy of the neo-imperial Iran. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  No doubt on that, too. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=840.6999999999999s)]
*  To send a drone to kill him in a moment where there was probably some diplomatic means to [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=843.54s)]
*  use in order to oblige Iran to withdraw, I think it was not a good way to do it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=853.3399999999999s)]
*  So right now the Iraqi parliament has set the wheels in motion there saying, hey, we [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=860.5s)]
*  want all foreign troops out. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=863.98s)]
*  What happens if they get their way? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=865.38s)]
*  First of all, it might be what Donald Trump wishes. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=868.8199999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump was elected under the motto and the promise to get out of the Middle East. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=873.1s)]
*  What is sure is that if this happens, if really America is compelled to leave and if really [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=880.6600000000001s)]
*  this fulfills a secret desire of your administration, those who will pay are the allies of America [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=889.5s)]
*  in the area, all of them. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=897.7800000000001s)]
*  The Kurds, but others. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=900.18s)]
*  Others. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=902.18s)]
*  And you know what I mean. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=903.18s)]
*  Does Iran fill that vacuum? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=904.18s)]
*  When you create such a huge vacuum as the one which Donald Trump created since his election, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=907.1s)]
*  the vacuum is immediately filled by Erdogan in the old area of influence of the Ottoman [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=914.7s)]
*  empire by Putin, who is recovering his dreams and our nightmares, who is rebuilding a sort [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=923.4200000000001s)]
*  of belt, imperial belt around Russia, by Iran, by China, of course, by the most radical Sunni [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=931.1800000000001s)]
*  Islam, which is the former caliphate. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=941.3000000000001s)]
*  Of course, it is filled by some revisionist powers who have the nostalgia of their past [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  greatness. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=951.1800000000001s)]
*  And they are the guys we are just saying. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  So for me, if Turkey was a democratic country, if Iran was governed by the ladies and boys [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=955.46s)]
*  who are demonstrating in the street for human rights, I would have no objection to them [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=966.86s)]
*  filling the vacuum. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=972.9000000000001s)]
*  But the problem is that these countries are governed by terrible guys, enemies of their [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=973.98s)]
*  own people, making war not only against us, but against their own population. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=981.6999999999999s)]
*  This is the point. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=987.5s)]
*  How does Europe see all of this playing out? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=989.38s)]
*  And the American president has said they should be doing more, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=992.22s)]
*  Whether it's paying more into NATO or if they care so much about the rest of the world [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=995.4599999999999s)]
*  in the regions, let them get more involved, let them put more boots on the ground. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1000.22s)]
*  Should Europe do more? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1004.34s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1005.34s)]
*  It is the only point on which Trump is right. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1006.34s)]
*  Even Trump can be right. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1010.78s)]
*  And it is true that Europe does not do enough. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1012.62s)]
*  And to be frank, Europe does not even exist in military terms. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1015.7s)]
*  There is no common defense. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1021.26s)]
*  There is no common force, despite the will of Macron. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1025.5s)]
*  President Macron is a real European patriot, but he is very alone. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1029.9799999999998s)]
*  One example. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1034.1399999999999s)]
*  When Trump announced his decision to retreat from Syria, there was, I think, 2,000 troops, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1035.4599999999998s)]
*  American troops. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1042.86s)]
*  If the 27 countries of Europe had decided to fill the vacuum, it was not so difficult. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1043.86s)]
*  2,000 divided by 27, your spectator will make the division. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1051.62s)]
*  I'm not so good in calculation. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1056.3s)]
*  It was doable. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1059.3799999999999s)]
*  We did not. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1060.82s)]
*  Why does the United States have a responsibility to that region, right? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1061.82s)]
*  There are all of the supporters of the president who put him in power say, you know, there [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1066.4199999999998s)]
*  is no solution to the Middle East. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1071.6599999999999s)]
*  It was maybe wrong for us to go there in the first place, but let's get the hell out one [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1073.56s)]
*  way or another, whether they're showing us the door or whether we're leaving of our own [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1077.54s)]
*  accord. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1080.86s)]
*  What's it to us? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1082.82s)]
*  You can you can say that. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1084.6599999999999s)]
*  But then no surprise if you if we see in front of us a Persian Empire, a really revitalized. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1087.26s)]
*  If we see the former Soviet, you find big Russia, not Soviet now rebuilt. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1099.8999999999999s)]
*  If we see Israel under fire and under attack by a very strong Hezbollah, OK, it's a choice. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1108.66s)]
*  It is not mine. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1119.66s)]
*  And it is not the choice of the America which we which most of us love. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1121.14s)]
*  But this is the problem. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1128.38s)]
*  We can decide that we have nothing to do with this area and that America becomes a fortress [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1129.92s)]
*  and Europe and other fortress that will build some walls and that what happens beyond these [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1136.3s)]
*  walls is not our business. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1141.5s)]
*  It's a choice. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1143.6599999999999s)]
*  But my belief is that in terms of morality and in terms of interest of self interest, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1144.6599999999999s)]
*  it will be a disaster to accept this partition of the world, to accept that half of the world [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1154.4199999999998s)]
*  goes back to darkness and to those revisionist powers. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1160.66s)]
*  It will be the worst calculation for our society's economies and the vision of the world. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1166.78s)]
*  Bernard, thank you so much. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3r95u1us1Q&t=1174.46s)]
