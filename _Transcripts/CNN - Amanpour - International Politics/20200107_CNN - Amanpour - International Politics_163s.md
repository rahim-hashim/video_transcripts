# Mohammad Marandi Discusses National Outrage in Iran | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w)
*  Your family, I think, were out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=0.0s)]
*  in this funeral procession [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=2.6s)]
*  and taking part in this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=4.2s)]
*  explosion of national mourning [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=5.84s)]
*  and emotion. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=7.84s)]
*  Just give us a sense of what it [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=8.94s)]
*  actually is like on the ground. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=11.0s)]
*  What did they sense out there? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  Well, my family and everyone [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=14.94s)]
*  around me, they all said that it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=16.94s)]
*  was extraordinary and that they [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=19.7s)]
*  had never seen such a crowd [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  before. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=24.04s)]
*  Some say it was over 5 million [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=24.84s)]
*  people in Tehran. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=26.5s)]
*  People were very angry and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=29.34s)]
*  outraged. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=31.900000000000002s)]
*  But during the prayers, they [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=33.5s)]
*  suddenly became very emotional, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=35.06s)]
*  especially when the leader was [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=37.26s)]
*  praying and weeping, the whole [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=39.2s)]
*  crowd, the millions of people, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=42.7s)]
*  suddenly they fell apart. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=44.1s)]
*  So it was a very emotional [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=45.94s)]
*  event, but it was also an event [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=47.94s)]
*  where people were extremely [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=49.66s)]
*  outraged by what the Trump [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=50.96s)]
*  administration had done. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=54.06s)]
*  So let me ask you this, because [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=56.0s)]
*  clearly the next step is in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=57.64s)]
*  Iran's hands. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=60.3s)]
*  What will Iran do? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=62.1s)]
*  We have had the general telling [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  CNN that there will be [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=66.54s)]
*  proportionate military [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=69.28s)]
*  retaliation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=70.58s)]
*  I just want to play a little bit [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=71.64s)]
*  of the interview that he gave to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=73.08s)]
*  our Fred Pleitkamp and then ask [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=76.44s)]
*  For sure, no American military [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=77.1s)]
*  staff, no American political [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=78.98s)]
*  center, no American military [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=80.78s)]
*  base, no American vessel in the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=82.84s)]
*  world will be safe. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=85.28s)]
*  If he says 52 sites, we say 300, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=87.14s)]
*  and they're accessible to us. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=90.5s)]
*  We'll get to the numbers in a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=93.0s)]
*  moment, but what do you expect? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=94.1s)]
*  I mean, you've lived this, you've [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=97.1s)]
*  watched the regime, you have [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=98.74s)]
*  seen the back and forth during [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=100.6s)]
*  tense times between the United [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=102.38s)]
*  States and Iran. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=104.54s)]
*  What will Iran decide to do that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  potentially is proportionate and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=109.1s)]
*  manageable and won't slide into [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=111.44s)]
*  accidental all-out war with the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=113.44s)]
*  U.S.? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=114.98s)]
*  Well, the belief here is that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=116.74s)]
*  Iran can't appease the Trump [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=118.44s)]
*  regime because if they do, he [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  will only carry out more [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=122.64s)]
*  atrocities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  He'll be killing more people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  And therefore, Iran feels that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  the United States government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=128.68s)]
*  under Trump has to be punished [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=130.54s)]
*  in a way where they regret what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=132.5s)]
*  they did. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=134.0s)]
*  What Trump has so far done is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=135.48s)]
*  he's mobilized the whole [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=136.94s)]
*  country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=138.44s)]
*  The country is completely [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=139.14s)]
*  united. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=141.74s)]
*  Everyone believes that this was [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=142.78s)]
*  an act of war against Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L1EJO6XS-w&t=144.48s)]
