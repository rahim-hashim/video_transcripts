Video Description: From the heart of Athens, Christiane Amanpour sits down with former U.S. president Barack Obama, who has devoted his post-presidency to strengthening the foundations of democracy at home and abroad. Six years since the end of his second term in office, there is compelling evidence worldwide that democracy is wavering. The former president is raising the alarm and calling on his foundation to celebrate the next generation of democratic leaders. In an exclusive conversation with Barack Obama in Athens’ SNF cultural center, Christiane asks the question: Will democracy claw its way back?

# Will Democracy Win? Barack Obama in Conversation with Christiane Amanpour  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o)
*  Can I ask you about your commitment to democracy right here in Athens? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=0.0s)]
*  You did give a speech, your last speech as president, about a week after President Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=4.5s)]
*  won. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=10.3s)]
*  And you talked about your faith in the, you know, the solidity of the democratic ideals. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=11.3s)]
*  A lot has happened still since then, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=17.22s)]
*  That's true. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=20.22s)]
*  Do you still feel that way? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=21.22s)]
*  Do you feel democracy will win? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=22.22s)]
*  I do believe that democracy will win if we fight for it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=24.52s)]
*  You know, one of the themes of that speech, I then, a year or so later at the centennial [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=29.86s)]
*  of Nelson Mandela's birthday in Johannesburg, gave a speech about democracy as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=37.8s)]
*  And it's obviously continued to be an obsession of mine with the foundation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=43.7s)]
*  Democracy is not self-executing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  It depends on the engagement of citizens and an active mobilization of people around the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=52.46s)]
*  belief, not just in any particular issue, but the belief in self-governance and rule [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=63.48s)]
*  of law and independent judiciary and a free press. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=68.92s)]
*  All the civic institutions that go into making a democracy work. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think it is indisputable that a combination of forces have put enormous strains on democracy [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=78.14s)]
*  and that we've seen a backlash against democratic ideals around the world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=87.26s)]
*  It's not unique to any one place. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=93.84s)]
*  It's happened in Europe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  It's happened in the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=99.12s)]
*  It's happened in this part of the world, around the Mediterranean. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=101.32s)]
*  It's happening in Asia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=106.54s)]
*  The reason I'm optimistic is because I believe, particularly as I meet young people around [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  the world, there is still a fundamental belief in the dignity and worth of individuals and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=115.4s)]
*  their agency in determining what their lives are like. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=124.54s)]
*  I think that's what young people want. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=126.84s)]
*  But our existing democratic institutions are creaky, and we're going to have to reform [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=130.22s)]
*  So let's ask about the creaky or not institutions in the United States. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  The spectacle of a former president being federally indicted. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=141.6s)]
*  How is the rest of the world, the democratic world, maybe even the non-democratic world, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=146.96s)]
*  meant to interpret that indictment and indeed the fact that a federal indictee is running, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=151.1s)]
*  is able to run for the highest office in the land, maybe even the world? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  It's less than ideal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=162.4s)]
*  But the fact that we have a former president who is having to answer to charges brought [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=165.2s)]
*  by prosecutors does uphold the basic notion that nobody's above the law. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=176.33999999999997s)]
*  And the allegations will now be sorted out through a court process. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  And I think I'm more concerned when it comes to the United States with the fact that not [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=190.1s)]
*  just one particular individual is being accused of undermining existing laws, but that more [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=198.18s)]
*  broadly we've seen, whether it's through the gerrymandering of districts, whether it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  trying to silence critics through changes in the legislative process, whether it's attempts [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=217.1s)]
*  to intimidate the press, a strand of anti-democratic sentiment that we've seen in the United States. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=226.24s)]
*  It's something that is right now most prominent in the Republican Party, but I don't think [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=239.98s)]
*  it's something that is unique to one party. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=245.1s)]
*  I think there is less tolerance for ideas that don't suit us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  And sort of the habits of a free and open exchange of ideas and the idea that we all agree to the rules [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=258.94s)]
*  of the game and even if the outcomes aren't always the ones we like, we still abide by those rules. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=268.1s)]
*  I think that's weakened since I left office and we're going to need to strengthen them again. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=273.28s)]
*  So I do need to ask you then a follow-up on that because what happens if Donald Trump wins again? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=278.55999999999995s)]
*  It's said that the institutional guardrails of American democracy were strong enough to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=283.88s)]
*  survive a one-term presidency. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  Are they strong enough to survive if that kind of personality wins again? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=293.88s)]
*  I won't speculate on the outcome of a future election. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=300.16s)]
*  Obviously I'm a Democrat, I've got a deep interest in the outcome, but I'll make a general statement [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=305.36s)]
*  which is having been president of the United States, you need a president who takes the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  oath of office seriously. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0LNe06Ev1o&t=318.8s)]
