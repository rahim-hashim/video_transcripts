*  did your office hear about what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=36.74s)]

*  U.S.-Canada border over the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=41.44s)]
*  weekend? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=42.84s)]
*  Yeah, I first started getting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=44.04s)]
*  text messages and e-mails early [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=46.24s)]
*  Sunday morning from Iranian [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=49.32s)]
*  Americans, whom I actually know [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=51.28s)]
*  personally, saying either this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=55.08s)]
*  is something that's happened to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=57.82s)]
*  my family or this is something [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=59.42s)]
*  I've been hearing about. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=61.22s)]
*  Could you look into it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=62.66s)]
*  And so, at that point, we then, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=64.36s)]
*  I notified my staff. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=67.06s)]
*  We contacted our federal [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=68.72s)]
*  delegation and reached out to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=70.7s)]
*  Iranian-American interest groups, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=73.6s)]
*  the civil liberties groups and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=76.14s)]
*  others, and very quickly, we [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=78.3s)]
*  were all able to get on the same [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=80.9s)]
*  page and start collecting more [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=82.48s)]
*  information about what had been [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  going on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  So, what were some of these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=86.44s)]
*  people who you knew describing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  happened to them? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=89.74s)]
*  What we heard is that Iranian [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=91.0s)]
*  Americans, U.S. citizens who had [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=93.88s)]
*  been visiting Vancouver for the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  weekend, which is quite common [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=97.88s)]
*  among Washingtonians to go cross [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=99.28s)]
*  the border, in this case, I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=101.72s)]
*  think quite a good number of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=104.02s)]
*  these Iranian Americans had gone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=105.61999999999999s)]
*  to Vancouver for a pop concert, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=106.78s)]
*  that when they were on their way [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=109.82s)]
*  back to cross back into the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  United States, they were asked [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=112.3s)]
*  to leave their car. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=114.86s)]
*  You know, when they're going [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=117.12s)]
*  through, driving through the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=117.86s)]
*  border, they were asked after [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=120.02s)]
*  the kind of routine questioning, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=122.52s)]
*  they were asked to leave their [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=123.66s)]
*  car, park their car, and then go [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=124.46s)]
*  into a processing center where [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  they waited for several hours [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=129.54s)]
*  without being given any [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=132.0s)]
*  explanation as to why, and then [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=133.34s)]
*  brought into an office and asked [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=135.8s)]
*  questions by an officer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=138.94s)]
*  The questions included things [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  like, you know, tell us about [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=142.62s)]
*  any times that you have gone to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=145.74s)]
*  Iran, when was the last time, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=147.52s)]
*  who are your parents, uncles, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=150.08s)]
*  siblings, cousins, do they have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=153.16s)]
*  any tie to the Iranian military, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=155.8s)]
*  Iranian government, lots of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=157.62s)]
*  questions about what do you do, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=159.76s)]
*  where do you live, all of these [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=162.36s)]
*  kinds of things, and then after [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=164.16s)]
*  that questioning, they were asked [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=165.94s)]
*  to wait again for several hours [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=167.9s)]
*  while that information was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=169.8s)]
*  shared with some other either [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=170.9s)]
*  center or it's not clear with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=174.48s)]
*  whom, and then in some cases, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=176.28s)]
*  they were asked even some [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=178.04s)]
*  follow-up questions, and then [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=179.24s)]
*  finally they were let go. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=180.28s)]
*  And so we heard about folks, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=181.62s)]
*  again, U.S. citizens being held [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=184.24s)]
*  at the border, not allowed to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=186.92s)]
*  come back into their home [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  country for anywhere from five [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=190.88s)]
*  to, in one case, we heard over [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=194.0s)]
*  10, 12 hours. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=196.06s)]
*  Besides the inconvenience, is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=197.3s)]
*  there something that these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  border authorities are asking [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  that is beyond the purview, that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=203.02s)]
*  they should not be asking when [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=204.52s)]
*  people are coming across the U.S. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=206.86s)]
*  border? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=208.22s)]
*  In my view, there's no reason to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=208.76s)]
*  treat Iranian Americans any [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=213.4s)]
*  differently than any other [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  American, and so my position is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  I can understand if it's the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=220.08s)]
*  belief of homeland security that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=222.44s)]
*  we are in a state of heightened [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=224.38s)]
*  security. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=225.72s)]
*  So in my opinion, that is a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=227.5s)]
*  direct consequence of the way in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=229.94s)]
*  which the president has handled [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=232.54s)]
*  our relationship with Iran, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  whether it's through withdrawing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=237.22s)]
*  from the Joint Comprehensive Plan [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=238.61999999999998s)]
*  of Action, the so-called Iran [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  deal, or the escalation with [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  respect to the drone attack that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  killed Soleimani. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=247.16s)]
*  Perhaps, and I think it's highly [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=249.16s)]
*  likely, that that has placed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=250.66s)]
*  Americans at greater risk. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  But if that's the case, then the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=255.66s)]
*  security measures we need to be [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=257.8s)]
*  taking include asking everybody [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=258.86s)]
*  extra questions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=262.14s)]
*  So if there's a security issue, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=263.0s)]
*  then all of us, when we come back [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=264.34s)]
*  into the country, need to be [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=267.7s)]
*  treated equally. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  That's no excuse for racial [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=271.58s)]
*  profiling. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=273.82s)]
*  So it's very clear there's racial [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=274.64s)]
*  profiling going on when, A, the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=276.24s)]
*  people who are being held are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=279.02s)]
*  Iranian Americans and there's no [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  reports of others, and plus the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  Iranian Americans could very [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=285.58s)]

*  Farsi. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=288.64s)]
*  They could recognize that the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=289.58s)]
*  others were Iranian American. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=291.18s)]
*  And then, B, the questions that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=292.52s)]
*  are being asked are very clearly [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  tied to a concern about the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  tensions with Iran. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  So questions being asked like, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  do you have family members in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  the Iranian Guard, et cetera. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=305.46s)]
*  So all of those are completely [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=307.82s)]
*  inappropriate, in my view. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=310.4s)]
*  The U.S. passport, in my view, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  is like a key to your house. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=316.92s)]
*  And so when you come home at the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=320.52s)]
*  end of your day, the last thing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=324.06s)]
*  that you deserve is for a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=326.2s)]

*  your house saying, I know you [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=329.64s)]
*  got the keys to get in, but just [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=330.53999999999996s)]
*  we got to ask you a few [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=332.53999999999996s)]

*  the back of my head, I can hear [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=339.88s)]
*  a supporter of the president [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=341.15999999999997s)]

*  suggesting that these same [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=343.34s)]

*  If there was a time for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=357.91999999999996s)]

*  So I'm not denying that this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=365.56s)]
*  may be a time when CBP should be [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=367.2s)]

*  So, you know, we are Americans. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=378.24s)]
*  We either were born in this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=382.18s)]

*  then stay here long enough, take [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  the test and become naturalized [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  U.S. citizens. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=400.62s)]
*  So, you know, all of us are [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=401.52s)]
*  Americans. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=403.76s)]
*  And when we start going down the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=404.86s)]
*  path of saying, well, who are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  your parents, who are your [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=408.76s)]

*  What's your last name? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=411.06s)]
*  Then we are headed down the path [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=412.5s)]
*  that we here on the West Coast [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=415.3s)]

*  Every time we learn about the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=418.94s)]
*  history of Japanese American [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=420.0s)]

*  concentration camps. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=432.26s)]
*  And so while we're clearly not [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=433.3s)]

*  false. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=598.16s)]

*  to you? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=609.72s)]
*  I mean, it's very personal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=610.72s)]
*  You know, I'll say, I mean, you [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=612.2s)]
*  know, we all feel it personally [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=615.08s)]
*  as Americans any time we see [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=619.96s)]
*  injustice in our country. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=622.3s)]
*  You know, I do believe that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=624.8s)]

*  to justice everywhere. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=627.76s)]
*  And certainly we've seen people [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=629.16s)]
*  of color being and immigrants [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=631.96s)]

*  All of those affect us as [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=645.04s)]
*  Americans. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=647.12s)]
*  I will say in this instance, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=647.96s)]
*  personally, it feels kind of a [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=649.76s)]
*  particularly powerful and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=653.24s)]
*  poignant because the experience [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=655.04s)]
*  of coming back across the border [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=657.52s)]
*  is something that that almost [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=659.72s)]
*  every Washingtonian knows. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=661.12s)]
*  You know, we we we very much view [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=663.12s)]
*  British Columbia as a neighbor. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  But I will also say that for all [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=667.36s)]
*  of us, you know, since 9-11 [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=669.12s)]
*  Middle Eastern Americans, we [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=672.04s)]
*  always kind of have a sense when [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=673.24s)]
*  we fly back into the country or [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=675.28s)]
*  go through immigration and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=678.04s)]
*  customs, we always have a little [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=679.36s)]
*  bit of a sense of, you know, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=680.48s)]
*  well, we better be on our best [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=682.28s)]
*  behavior or what might happen, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=683.4s)]
*  which is really unfair in the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=685.8s)]
*  first place, that as U.S. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=687.08s)]
*  citizens, we should feel that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=688.6s)]
*  kind of, you know, sense of [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=690.32s)]
*  nervousness when coming back to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=692.84s)]
*  our own home country. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=695.36s)]
*  So, of course, I, you know, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=696.5200000000001s)]
*  because I share that identity, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=698.48s)]
*  I not only feel outrage on behalf [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=700.24s)]
*  of my constituents, but also I [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=703.12s)]
*  can identify I can identify with [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=706.88s)]
*  these individuals in a very [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=708.88s)]
*  special way. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  So here you are, an American of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=710.76s)]
*  Iranian descent. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=712.0400000000001s)]
*  How do you use your position of [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  influence to change this? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, the first thing is that by [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=716.64s)]
*  speaking with you and other media [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=720.16s)]
*  outlets, what I'm doing and what [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=724.12s)]
*  I think we need to do, who care [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  about this, is to amplify these [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=729.48s)]
*  voices and tell their stories. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=732.44s)]
*  First of all, to put the Trump [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=735.36s)]
*  administration on notice, to say [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=737.6s)]
*  to them, no, actually, when you [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=739.72s)]
*  do this, when you do this to five [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=741.88s)]
*  hundred people or 50 people, you [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=743.8s)]
*  know, or 500 people, we're going [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=746.4s)]
*  to know, we're going to call you [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=748.64s)]
*  out and we're going to call you [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=750.72s)]
*  to account to explain to us why [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=751.6s)]
*  are you racially profiling? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=753.2s)]
*  Why are you violating folks' [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=754.4s)]
*  constitutional rights as [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=756.72s)]
*  Americans to have equal [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=758.0s)]
*  protection under the law? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=759.48s)]
*  So that's the first thing is that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=761.04s)]
*  we need to be amplifying those [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=762.92s)]
*  stories, making sure that they [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  are heard and that the government [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=767.72s)]
*  knows that they cannot get away [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=771.12s)]
*  with doing this. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=772.72s)]
*  We are all going to be shining [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=774.08s)]
*  the light on what is going on at [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=775.36s)]
*  the border and what is going on [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=777.36s)]
*  at airports. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=779.36s)]
*  And then the second reason, the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=780.44s)]
*  second thing that we're doing is [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=782.44s)]
*  we are collecting these stories. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=784.24s)]
*  We are documenting them [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=786.84s)]
*  thoroughly. We've got folks who [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=788.12s)]
*  have signed legal declarations [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=789.36s)]
*  under threat of perjury. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=792.48s)]
*  And so we are collecting those so [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  that we have the option to pursue [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=796.36s)]
*  either at the governmental level [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=801.52s)]
*  through our through state [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=804.32s)]
*  government or the civil liberties [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=805.12s)]
*  organizations, the Iranian [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=808.4s)]
*  American Bar Association, the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=809.44s)]
*  ACLU and others to seek legal [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=811.24s)]
*  redress. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=813.64s)]
*  And then finally, I've been in [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=814.48s)]
*  very close contact with Senator [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=816.08s)]
*  Patty Murray and other members [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=818.16s)]
*  of our delegation so that they [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=821.0s)]
*  can use their power in federal [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=823.28s)]
*  government in Congress, which [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=825.12s)]
*  they already have to push [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=827.04s)]
*  leaders in homeland security to [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=829.16s)]
*  get better answers and get [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=830.76s)]
*  better clarity to make it clear [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=831.96s)]
*  this is unacceptable for our [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=833.76s)]
*  whole country. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=836.36s)]
*  But we feel it more powerful here [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=836.96s)]
*  in Washington state because we're [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=838.4399999999999s)]
*  so proud of our border. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=840.0s)]
*  We're so proud of the peace arch [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=841.24s)]
*  and our connection to British [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=843.04s)]
*  Columbia. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=844.2s)]
*  So that's what we're doing. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=844.68s)]
*  But there's one other thing that [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=845.96s)]
*  as an Iranian American, I think [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=847.2s)]
*  it's important for me to do, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=849.0s)]
*  which is on this larger issue of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=850.76s)]

*  I think it's really important [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=856.76s)]
*  that other Americans, my fellow [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=858.68s)]

*  Iranian Americans are no friends [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=863.6s)]

*  that when we escalate, all we do [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=874.48s)]

*  I think we take a big step [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=897.88s)]
*  backward on that front as well. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=899.08s)]
*  And that leaves the entire region [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=900.32s)]

*  to go to Colombia, Oxford, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=915.2s)]

*  what's the driving force behind that? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=923.84s)]
*  Well, I appreciate you telling [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=926.24s)]
*  that to people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  So they're not just wondering, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  why is this guy wearing sunglasses, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=928.72s)]
*  especially in notoriously [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  rainy Seattle? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=932.08s)]
*  Yeah, I lost my eyesight as a child [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  when I was eight years old. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=936.76s)]
*  I lost it to cancer. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=938.2s)]
*  That was in 1989. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=940.12s)]
*  So I often joke that all eight [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=941.4s)]
*  years I could see did take place [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=943.32s)]
*  in the 1980s. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=944.9200000000001s)]
*  So all my visual memories [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=946.12s)]
*  are still from the 80s. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=947.56s)]
*  So everyone still looks like [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=948.52s)]
*  Cyndi Lauper and Boy George. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=949.5999999999999s)]
*  We, you know, having had that [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=952.0s)]
*  that happened to me, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=954.52s)]
*  as you can imagine, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=956.56s)]
*  was not only tough for me [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=958.4799999999999s)]
*  to adapt to, but for my parents [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=960.28s)]
*  who were Iranian Americans [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=961.64s)]
*  and who live thousands [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=963.9599999999999s)]
*  of miles away from the country [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=965.56s)]
*  of their birth. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=967.1199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, to have your child [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=968.8399999999999s)]
*  go through cancer and lose [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=971.2399999999999s)]
*  his eyesight is so tough [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=972.52s)]
*  on a parent. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=974.92s)]
*  But what they knew, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=975.92s)]
*  which is really the truth [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=978.76s)]
*  about America, is that at its best, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  this is a country where [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=983.04s)]
*  no matter who you are, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=984.72s)]
*  no matter what your abilities are, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=985.72s)]
*  no matter where your [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=987.4s)]
*  your ancestors came from, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=989.84s)]
*  this is a country where you ought [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=992.04s)]
*  to be able to work hard, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=993.24s)]
*  take risks and get ahead [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=995.2s)]
*  and be given opportunity. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=996.72s)]
*  And so they did everything they could [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=997.92s)]
*  to teach me that lesson [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=999.96s)]
*  and to give me that boldness [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1001.92s)]
*  to go ahead and fulfill [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1004.04s)]
*  my own potential. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1005.92s)]
*  And then as I got older, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1007.24s)]
*  I realized that, you know, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1008.76s)]
*  I had been so fortunate [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1010.84s)]
*  to have parents, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1012.4s)]
*  including a mom who's now a judge. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1013.28s)]
*  She was an attorney [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1014.88s)]
*  when I was a kid [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1016.52s)]
*  who taught me my rights [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1018.0s)]
*  and who taught me about my right [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1020.12s)]
*  to be included, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1021.92s)]
*  that I was so fortunate [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1023.8s)]
*  and most people aren't. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1024.76s)]
*  And yet there are so many [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1025.72s)]
*  who are excluded [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1026.68s)]
*  for various reasons. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1028.56s)]
*  And so I decided I wanted [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1030.0s)]
*  to become a lawyer and go into [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1031.04s)]
*  elected office so that I could be [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1033.28s)]
*  an advocate for them, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1035.04s)]
*  because I knew, you know, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1036.84s)]
*  I'm I was fortunate enough [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1037.84s)]
*  to travel the road from Braille [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1039.56s)]
*  to Yale [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1040.96s)]
*  and that having a 24 hour a day [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1042.48s)]
*  pro bono attorney as a mom [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1045.16s)]
*  was a big part of that. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1047.44s)]
*  Most people don't have that privilege. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  And so that's what I've sought to do [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1049.96s)]
*  for others who feel excluded [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1052.12s)]
*  and left out. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1054.52s)]
*  Same way as, you know, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1055.2s)]
*  when I was in third grade, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1056.48s)]
*  I wasn't allowed to play [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1057.56s)]
*  on the playground [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1058.36s)]
*  or later when I was told [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1059.3999999999999s)]
*  you can't take advanced [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1061.04s)]
*  placement classes in science [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1061.96s)]

*  The same way these are Americans [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1065.64s)]
*  being being told [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1067.8s)]
*  you can't go home yet. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1068.92s)]
*  You can't go home yet. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1069.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1070.96s)]
*  For no other reason [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1071.64s)]
*  other than this is your last name. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1072.44s)]
*  And so anytime that happens, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1074.0s)]
*  it it takes me back [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  to those earliest experiences [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3JHFOrp8Qw&t=1079.04s)]
