*  So he has been sent behind bars for for for impacting communal harmony in a country for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=100.78s)]
*  for stopping fake news, for busting fake news. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=109.22s)]
*  So this award is, while it is a shot in the arm, it is it is scary because we are living [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=112.1s)]
*  in a time when journalists are the new enemies of the state, more so in India, where the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=120.66s)]
*  world's largest democracy is descending in some kind of a police state. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=125.74s)]
*  What we are witnessing every day, it feels like it feels or really it feels like I'm [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=131.5s)]
*  living in a dystopia where journalists are being arrested, intimidated for speaking truth [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=135.84s)]
*  to power to save the constitutional values. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=142.6s)]
*  In the last one week, I have got the most disturbing death and rape threats. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=146.44s)]
*  I'm speaking to you on this interview. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=152.7s)]
*  I don't even know if this interview will be held against me and I could be booked for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=154.36s)]
*  a loss like sedition. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=158.06s)]
*  I don't know what my future in India looks like because a lot of well-meaning friends [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  are telling me to leave the country, but that's not a choice that I've got right now because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=164.48s)]
*  this is the country of my birth. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=169.12s)]
*  This is the country of my forefathers. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=170.72s)]
*  And this is the country I choose to speak the truth about to celebrate its democratic [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=172.44s)]
*  ethos. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=178.04s)]
*  You have been the target of so many different accusations and investigations by the government, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=179.2s)]
*  which you say are unjustified. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=185.32s)]
*  I mean, your bank account has been frozen twice as part of what the government says [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=188.6s)]
*  is a money laundering and tax evasion investigation into whether you mishandled funds that you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=192.92s)]
*  raise for covid relief. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  You've been charged with defamation in several states across India and at points you've been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  stopped by immigration and prevented from leaving. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=206.92s)]
*  But how do you respond to this kind of scrutiny? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=209.16s)]
*  I mean, what is it that do they have they provided any evidence to you to say this is our [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  evidence of why you've mishandled funds? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=217.88s)]
*  I have responded to the Indian government summons by appearing before the agencies. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=220.84s)]
*  And this is the question that I have been asking them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  You have accused me of money laundering over relief work done by for covid-19 victims for [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  slum dwellers who did not have access to basic health care. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=234.72s)]
*  Doing all this, the government of India has taken 35 percent of the money raised on the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  funds as income tax. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=246.12s)]
*  And on the same hand, they have accused me of misappropriating funds when every single [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=249.6s)]
*  penny of the fund has been accounted for. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=255.24s)]
*  I even gave a chunk of the money to a hospital for a pediatric covid board, but the hospital [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=258.88s)]
*  had to return the money because the government officials called them and said you cannot [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=265.48s)]
*  take her money. So you do not want me to spend the money. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=270.24s)]
*  And when I do, you're accusing me of misappropriating the funds. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=273.56s)]
*  The government is basically desperate to try to build a case against me. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  Three weeks ago, I've got another notice that says you have to submit all your foreign [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=281.24s)]
*  remittances. So what started with money laundering has now gone on to submitting my foreign [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=285.44s)]
*  remittances. They have asked me for my contract with Washington Post and Substack. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=291.2s)]
*  They have asked me for my contractual obligations with international publications, including [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  Time Magazine, for whom I wrote a devastating cover last year. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=301.76s)]
*  They have asked me a copy of the contract that I shared with Time Magazine to build [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=305.52s)]
*  this narrative that I am taking foreign money to discredit India to destabilize India. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=309.96s)]
*  My bank accounts are being discussed on live television. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=315.55999999999995s)]
*  My earnings of the last 15 years have been termed as proceeds of crime. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  Me and my family, we have been made a free for all. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=323.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't have a personal life. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=326.44s)]
*  Everything that I do in my life is being dissected for a link, virtual lynch mob out [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  there, which is waiting for this government signal to come after me. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=333.16s)]
*  So this is what my daily life is. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  And this is what each one of us is facing right now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=339.68s)]
*  From the outside, if I look at India, I'll say, look, this is a country with more than [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=343.68s)]
*  one hundred and forty thousand registered news publications. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  There's four hundred TV channels. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=351.92s)]
*  How does she feel that she's being picked on? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=354.48s)]
*  Isn't there a vibrant press in this country? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  India has a vibrant press on on paper. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=359.76s)]
*  But look at the reporters on frontiers own reports on world press freedom. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=362.56s)]
*  India is much worse than countries which do not even have a democracy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=368.84s)]
*  Let me give you a few examples. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=374.16s)]
*  Siddique Kappan, a journalist, a Muslim journalist, has been behind bars for the last [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=375.68s)]
*  three years. He was on his way to heartthrobs to report the gang rape of a lower class girl. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=379.56s)]
*  He was apprehended on the way while he was going to report a story. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=386.44s)]
*  He had not even reported the story for the last three years. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=391.52s)]
*  He has been behind bars when his mother died. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=394.08s)]
*  She was troubled by her son's incarceration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=397.4s)]
*  He was not even allowed to go for her last rites. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=400.04s)]
*  Another journalist, Zubair Ahmed, is from the Andamans. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=403.52s)]
*  He put out a tweet about misgovernance due to covid. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=406.48s)]
*  He was arrested for the tweet three days ago. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=410.32s)]
*  The journalist died by suicide. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=413.6s)]
*  His psychiatrist said that he was taking antidepressants since the case in Kashmir. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=415.8s)]
*  I mean, let's not even a Kashmiri journalist was stopped a week ago. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=420.4s)]
*  She was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=425.2s)]
*  She was stopped a week ago at the airport when she was on her way to France to display her work. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=426.96s)]
*  Kashmiri journalists are being picked up randomly from their homes [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=432.0s)]
*  for for for their alleged seditious work. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=437.0s)]
*  I have I have Kashmiri journalist friends who are literally hiding in Delhi right now as we talk. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  So this vibrant press that you're talking about is only on paper. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  And I can see this as a Muslim journalist also. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I would have never thought it out. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  Call myself a Muslim journalist. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=455.2s)]
*  But such are the times that most of the journalists who are being arrested off late [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=456.76s)]
*  are also being arrested because the government wants to set an example. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  These are Muslim journalists who the government is trying to, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=465.4s)]
*  you know, create a narrative that these are anti-nationals who are reporting against [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  Hindu sentiments, Hindu sentiments. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=473.4s)]
*  The the the the the latest is hurting Hindu sentiments, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  hurting this sentiment of the largest majority right now. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=480.11999999999995s)]
*  So that is what we are being accused of. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=483.23999999999995s)]
*  Is there anything specific that you have heard back, perhaps in writing from the government [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=485.55999999999995s)]
*  that is to why you are under such scrutiny? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you've certainly written unflattering pieces. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=493.76s)]
*  There was a piece in Time last year that I think it was titled This is Hell. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=497.16s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi's failure to lead is deepening India's covid-19 crisis. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=502.2s)]
*  There were a lot of people critical of India's covid response. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=506.48s)]
*  But you've been covering Prime Minister Modi for 20 plus years now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=510.8s)]
*  So is it because of what you reported out of the Gujarat riots? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=515.0s)]
*  Is it because of what you said during the covid pandemic? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=519.88s)]
*  Why you? Why now? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=523.12s)]
*  I think I have been a consistent target of Mr. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=524.48s)]
*  Modi's government, whether he was the chief when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=527.84s)]
*  when I went to Gujarat to to talk about his role in the Gujarat genocide of Muslims or [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=531.76s)]
*  the extrajudicial murder of Muslims, because I have consistently been calling out the bigotry [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=537.36s)]
*  and dog whistle. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  I have consistently maintained that Narendra Modi was complicit during the 2002 Gujarat [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=544.88s)]
*  riots, when a thousand Muslims were killed because he was silent throughout it all. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=550.56s)]
*  I have been to relief camps and I have met families and women who have been gang raped [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=557.28s)]
*  and children who have lost their families and who have witnessed the worst possible [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  horrors. I was 19 then. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  I have documented that because I'm a child of the Bombay riots in 92, 93 when a mob came [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=569.28s)]
*  to my house to pick me and my sister for a gang rape. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=573.8399999999999s)]
*  So I know what this feels like. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=576.8s)]
*  The trauma feels like and I have been consistently reporting my truth has not changed in 2014. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=579.16s)]
*  A lot of well-meaning journalists in India said, you know, Modi is now the prime minister. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=584.9599999999999s)]
*  We should probably look at him with a different lens. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=588.76s)]
*  And I said one cannot develop amnesia over a leader's past just because he's become [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=590.56s)]
*  a prime minister of the country. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=595.9599999999999s)]
*  And it was not my observation. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=597.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court of India in an open court in 2004 called the Modi government modern-day [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=599.76s)]
*  Nero's who looked the other way as innocent women and children were burning. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=606.56s)]
*  My job as a journalist is to bear witness irrespective of the of the cloud that Mr. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  Modi wheels in the country. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  That truth is not going to change. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=619.76s)]
*  My truth will not change. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=622.3599999999999s)]
*  What I witnessed on the ground is will not change. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=623.76s)]
*  I maintain even today what Mr. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=626.76s)]
*  Modi did in Gujarat at that point of time. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=628.76s)]
*  He's repeating the same formula today as the worst crimes happen in the name of religion. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=631.36s)]
*  Mr. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=637.36s)]
*  Modi remains silent. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=637.76s)]
*  He's a Twitter savvy prime minister who likes to tweet and Facebook about everything. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=639.76s)]
*  Why not a single tweet saying that India should maintain its democratic character? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=643.86s)]
*  Its plural character is secular character. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=649.16s)]
*  I think Mr. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=651.76s)]
*  Modi is enabling what we are witnessing in India through his silence and that's a truth. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=652.26s)]
*  I cannot look away from just recently India joined. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=656.56s)]
*  Several G7 nations and trying to at least on paper value of free press, right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=661.36s)]
*  And the Prime Minister himself set up a committee to try to improve India's ranking in the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=668.36s)]
*  World Press Freedom Index, which has India near the bottom. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=675.36s)]
*  When you see the government trying to improve itself, what's your reaction to this? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=679.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, is it for our consumption the rest of the world so to speak on the day that he signed? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=684.06s)]
*  He was at the G7 Summit on the day he signed the agreement for the press freedom and a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=689.46s)]
*  free speech. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  That's the very day that Muhammad Zubair was arrested a couple of days ago. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=697.0600000000001s)]
*  I got a note from Twitter that they had they had decided to withhold my account in India [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=700.6600000000001s)]
*  and then later they should a clarification that they have decided to withhold some of my [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=706.86s)]
*  tweets critical of the Indian government in 2021 that was related to covid-19 carnage in India. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=711.96s)]
*  The Indian government has also withheld tweets of Freedom House that downgraded India's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  democratic status. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=724.6600000000001s)]
*  So what is Mr. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=727.76s)]
*  Modi trying to suggest when he's trying to create this internal bodies to monitor press [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=729.6600000000001s)]
*  freedom? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=735.76s)]
*  I mean, if Mr. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=736.46s)]
*  Modi is really so concerned about the press freedom ratings, how about taking a press [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  conference? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=742.86s)]
*  The man has not taken a press conference in the last eight years. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=743.96s)]
*  You were speaking about my time magazine coverage in which I spoke about the covid-19 [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=747.16s)]
*  devastation. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=752.36s)]
*  It was absolutely important for me to do the time magazine cover story because at the time [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=753.26s)]
*  when covid was ravaging when dead bodies were flowing on the Ganga the Prime Minister [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  and his home minister were taking political rallies with tens of thousands of people leading [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=764.66s)]
*  to the covid-19 carnage and as soon as I did the time magazine cover within seven days, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=769.66s)]
*  I got a notice from the income tax Department asking for non-payment of advanced tax. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  This is where we are. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=780.26s)]
*  Mr. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=781.76s)]
*  Modi if he really means if he really means that he wants to be committed to press freedom. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  He needs to speak to each one of us. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=787.86s)]
*  He needs to answer critical questions instead of doing scripted interviews with just one [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=789.86s)]
*  news agency, which he has been doing for the last seven eight years the first interview [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=794.96s)]
*  that he did with a news agency in 2014. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=799.16s)]
*  He called critical news journalist as news traders. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=802.56s)]
*  That's how he came to power as as the Prime Minister of the country. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=806.56s)]
*  So I'm not expecting any better standards from the Prime Minister. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=809.86s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about Twitter on the one hand. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=813.86s)]
*  It is a platform where you have a million and a half followers. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=817.76s)]
*  You're able to share in this case most of your thoughts on lots of topics, right? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=821.66s)]
*  And on the other hand, what you're saying is if I'm understanding it correctly that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=827.16s)]
*  the Indian government is able to ask Twitter to selectively delete some of your free expressions, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=831.36s)]
*  right? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the Indian government has reached out to Twitter asking to delete my card remove [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=841.06s)]
*  my tweets that are critical of the government under the ID act. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=846.86s)]
*  Now the Twitter has approached the Karnataka High Court with a lawsuit that says that any [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=851.3599999999999s)]
*  such action is detrimental to the ideas of a democracy and the fundamentals of free press. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=857.8599999999999s)]
*  Now, fortunately or unfortunately Twitter has become a space for so many of us independent [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=864.16s)]
*  journalists where we can express ourselves in without gatekeepers monitoring or censoring us. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=869.4599999999999s)]
*  Many of many of us are independent journalists. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=876.3599999999999s)]
*  I might be a global opinions writer with the Washington Post. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=878.56s)]
*  But the truth is that for a domestic audience for an Indian audience, I do not have any [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=881.3599999999999s)]
*  platform to express myself in absence of any because most domestic publications do not [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=886.4599999999999s)]
*  want to publish me because there are so many cases against me. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=892.66s)]
*  I do have a platform internationally, but Twitter is the space Facebook Instagram. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=895.3599999999999s)]
*  These are spaces that allow me to speak my mind and that allows me to have an audience [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=899.66s)]
*  in India. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  But of the last couple of weeks, there is not a single day that I do not get a mail from [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  Twitter that we have got an email from agencies asking to remove your tweet in the interest [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=911.76s)]
*  of transparency. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=916.6600000000001s)]
*  We are telling this to you every day. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=917.46s)]
*  But at the same time almost every third day, there is a Twitter trend that says are a [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=920.26s)]
*  strong are you day before yesterday? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  They were 30,000 tweets. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=926.86s)]
*  Some of them asking for a gang rape to enter my house and gang rape me and my and my five [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=928.86s)]
*  year old niece. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=933.76s)]
*  The Delhi police, which is very proactive in arresting journalists. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=934.66s)]
*  I keep telling them in these tweets. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  They don't listen to me. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=939.4599999999999s)]
*  The kind of explicit death and rape threats that I have received. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=940.76s)]
*  I would not wish on my worst enemy. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=944.06s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=945.9599999999999s)]
*  This is what this is the free space that we have been accorded. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=947.66s)]
*  How do you keep going? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=952.66s)]
*  How do you not let pessimism get the best of you here? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=955.06s)]
*  Trust me, there are days it just it does get to me. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=959.3599999999999s)]
*  There are days when I have called my psychiatrist and said I cannot deal with it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=962.06s)]
*  It does get to you when you're monitored even in a foreign country when your actions [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=965.9599999999999s)]
*  are being monitored when your movements are being monitored. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=970.3599999999999s)]
*  I know for a fact that when I step out of the house, there is somebody monitoring me. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=972.8599999999999s)]
*  I know that I'm being monitored. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=976.66s)]
*  I know that my phone calls are being monitored, but this is exactly what I'm I'm [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=977.9599999999999s)]
*  campaigning against a surveillance state and undemocratic state and none of us. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=981.56s)]
*  A lot of my well-meaning journalists say, oh, you're being very brave. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=988.4599999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think I'm brave. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=991.06s)]
*  I don't even have the luxury of being brave. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=992.26s)]
*  I'm just speaking a truth which might be unpalatable, but has to be spoken. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=995.16s)]
*  You know, you wrote once that we should stop calling journalists brave. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1001.3599999999999s)]
*  That there is something more structural. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1006.66s)]
*  That's a problem when we do that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1008.56s)]
*  I think by calling us brave, we are normalizing the hate and the intimidation [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1012.8599999999999s)]
*  that is directed at us. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1018.26s)]
*  None of us need to go through this for doing our fundamental job of speaking [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1019.66s)]
*  truth to power for doing something as basic as bearing witness. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1024.16s)]
*  So I don't think why any one of us should be brave. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1029.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't think why Sadiq Kapoor should be brave. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1033.26s)]

*  I don't think why Asif Sultan should be brave. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1037.46s)]
*  This is the third year when they have not celebrated Eid with their families. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1039.46s)]
*  When you say brave, you're literally shooting from my shoulder saying, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1043.26s)]
*  oh, let her speak because she is brave. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1046.06s)]
*  No, I don't want to be brave. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1047.96s)]
*  I don't want to be, I don't want to be martyred because oh, she was brave [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1050.06s)]
*  and she chose this. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  No, my friends have been messaging me saying, listen, just just lie low [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1054.86s)]
*  for a while, don't read, don't write. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1058.06s)]
*  Is that what is being normalized? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1060.4599999999998s)]
*  Why should lying low be normalized in a country which calls itself [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1063.56s)]
*  the world's largest democracy? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1067.76s)]
*  I thought criticism was the most salient features of the Indian democracy. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1069.56s)]
*  What we do not realize is I love my country more than all these people [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1073.1599999999999s)]

*  liberty that the country accords to me and every citizen of this country. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1092.26s)]
*  Journalist Rana Ayub, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PRio4DcBu8&t=1096.86s)]
