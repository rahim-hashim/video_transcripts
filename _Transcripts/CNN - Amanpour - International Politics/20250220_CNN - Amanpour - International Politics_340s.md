Video Description: Ukraine has been fighting for its freedom for 1093 days and must now contend not only with Russia, but also with a reversal in U.S. foreign policy, as the United States welcomes Russia back into the fold. Meanwhile Trump's envoy Keith Kellogg is in the Ukrainian capital meeting with Zelensky. They were expected to give a joint press conference, but it didn't happen. Afterwards Zelensky said the meeting was productive and repeated he is grateful for U.S. support. He also said his team is ready to work 24/7 with the U.S. on the best way to achieve a proper peace. Boris Bondarev was a diplomat who quit his post and denounced the Putin regime after the invasion of Ukraine. He joined the show from Geneva to give us the Russian point of view.

# "The US is Not to be Trusted:" Putin Critic Boris Bondarev on Russia-Ukraine | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ)
*  Boris Bondareff, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to start by asking you some news that has arrived here in Washington, and that is, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=2.68s)]
*  U.S. intelligence says that it does not believe Vladimir Putin is even interested in these [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=8.76s)]
*  peace negotiations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=15.8s)]
*  And let me quote, we have zero intelligence that Putin is interested in a real peace deal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=17.68s)]
*  right now, this according to one of the congressional officials here. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=23.72s)]
*  He thinks he's winning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=28.54s)]
*  Tell me how you react to that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=31.18s)]
*  Do you think he can, because you quit and resigned in protest over the Russian invasion [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=58.54s)]
*  of Ukraine, do you think after three years in which the Russians are bogged down despite [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=76.94s)]
*  some little small territorial gains here and there over the last year, can he win? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  If we speak about Ukraine that loses its ability to defend itself, then I think it's possible. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=89.1s)]
*  It's not about Russian armies being bogged down in Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=100.58s)]
*  It's about that Ukraine may lose its will to defend because they may feel betrayed by [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  its best allies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=111.82s)]
*  And then Russia has a lot more manpower. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=113.82s)]
*  And the value of human life in Russia, we see, is very low. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=118.64s)]
*  Putin can waste thousands and thousands of Russians just to break through Ukraine. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=123.98s)]
*  And that's why he has steel resources. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=131.5s)]
*  He has steel resources and yes, he may win if Ukraine is not supported for quite a long time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  So, Mr. Bondarev, how do you analyze what's going on, this sort of war of words between [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine, who has resisted all these years with U.S. and NATO support, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=150.5s)]
*  and President Trump, who seems to be basically going at Zelensky for the moment using all [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=156.12s)]
*  Putin talking points? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  What do you think will be the result of that, the psychological result, the actual result? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=165.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think it wouldn't improve the morale in Ukrainian armed forces and in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=170.02s)]
*  Ukrainian society. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=177.26s)]
*  And they will ask themselves, maybe it's time to stop, maybe it's time to find some agreements [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=179.1s)]
*  with Russia, though it's not very possible. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=186.7s)]
*  So this U.S. rhetoric against Ukrainian authorities is very, very, you know, is very, very against [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=190.46s)]
*  the very basics that the United States had been fought since the beginning of this war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=201.8s)]
*  And of course, it plays in the hands of Putin. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=207.0s)]
*  So I really, I have no clue why the United States turns 180 degrees on all its foreign [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=210.28s)]
*  policy priorities. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=219.16s)]
*  Well, before I get into the talks with Russia, just I want you to think, why do you think [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=220.62s)]
*  the United States is doing that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=227.82s)]
*  We hear, for instance, from Russian analysts and this and that, people analyzing the Kremlin, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=229.66s)]
*  that we know why Putin is cozying up to Trump, because he believes that under Trump America's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=235.06s)]
*  leadership gets even weaker. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=242.24s)]
*  And that suits him, it suits China, it suits everybody just fine. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  Why do you think this 180 is happening, though, from the U.S. side? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=248.94s)]
*  Well, I'm not an expert on American politics, of course, but my impression is that, first, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=253.98s)]
*  President Trump wants to have his own personal foreign policy win, foreign policy success [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=262.82s)]
*  in ending this war, as he promised to his voters. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=271.08s)]
*  And second, I think he may still believe that he can succeed in splitting Russia from China. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's been a very popular American, I think American foreign political narrative [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=286.4s)]
*  for years, that Russia can be somehow put against China. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  So the United States could focus on its strategic competition with China. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's really baseless for now, that Russia will not be split from China, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  because they have a lot in common, they support each other. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=308.61999999999995s)]
*  And the United States is very, very unpredictable right now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  So the United States is not the country to be trusted, really. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  So I don't think why this hope is still surviving in American minds. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  It's a big question. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ig_GUPoIQ&t=323.73999999999995s)]
