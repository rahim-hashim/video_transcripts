# Anne Applebaum There Is a Part of the GOP That Sees Hungary as a Model  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk)
*  Now, earlier this week, Andrei Yermak, President Zelensky's chief of staff, told me that Ukrainians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=0.0s)]
*  are, quote, fighting for our land, country, and for all of democracy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=5.4s)]
*  That is an issue our next guest tackles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=9.82s)]
*  Anne Applebaum is staff writer for The Atlantic, and she's a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Her latest article, There is No Liberal World Order, argues that unless democracies defend [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=16.92s)]
*  themselves together, the forces of autocracy will destroy them. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=22.48s)]
*  And she joins Michelle Martin to discuss this existential struggle. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=26.56s)]
*  Thanks, Christiane. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  Anne Applebaum, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Delighted. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=35.44s)]
*  You've been writing, with some urgency, for some time now, about what you see as threats [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=36.44s)]
*  to democracy, democratic institutions worldwide. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  In fact, you've said very bluntly that the autocrats are winning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=48.64s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=54.72s)]
*  Our idea of an autocracy, that it's a strong man, maybe he controls the police, maybe there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=56.28s)]
*  are a few dissidents, he has some propaganda newspapers, is very outdated. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=63.08s)]
*  Nowadays, autocracies work together. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=71.56s)]
*  The state-owned oligarch-controlled companies in one country invest in the state-owned oligarch-controlled [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=75.2s)]
*  companies in another. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=81.28s)]
*  They share surveillance technology. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=83.2s)]
*  They share intelligence information. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=85.64s)]
*  They work together to help one another in different parts of the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=88.6s)]
*  They help one another evade sanctions. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=91.48s)]
*  They have similar goals, namely to push back against the democratic activism in their own [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=94.32s)]
*  countries and very often to undermine or attack democracies around the world, especially America [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=99.92s)]
*  and Europe, but also elsewhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=108.64s)]
*  And so what we're really dealing with now is it's not a formal network. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=111.52s)]
*  It's not a block. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=114.52s)]
*  But it is a semi-organized, almost like a corporation, Autocracy Inc., which is now [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=115.52s)]
*  putting up barriers to democracies, trying to undermine them, trying to alter the rules [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  of the game really in the world. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=130.56s)]
*  And of course, the most blatant and grotesque and violent evidence of this is the war in Ukraine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=133.04s)]
*  How does what we're seeing in Ukraine fit into this broader pattern? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=142.24s)]
*  Because I think that people have been, appropriately so, very focused on the immediate physical [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=146.96s)]
*  suffering of the people of the country, the huge refugee sort of outflow as a consequence [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=152.36s)]
*  of this sort of onslaught. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=159.08s)]
*  But how does the Ukraine campaign, how does Russia's attack on Ukraine fit into this broader pattern? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  So Russia's attack on Ukraine is really just the most egregious example of something we've [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  seen a lot of in the last few years, namely the fact that autocracies no longer believe [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  that there are any rules to follow or any norms that need to be met. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=177.68s)]
*  So whether it's hijacking planes, whether it's poisoning their citizens and other citizens, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  whether it's kidnapping or whether it's really assaults on their own people, as we've seen, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=187.28s)]
*  for example, in Venezuela or in Burma. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=192.28s)]
*  Whatever the offence is, they no longer feel any restraint. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  There's no, the human rights norms don't interest them, international law doesn't interest them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  They're willing to defile of that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=206.92s)]
*  And this, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is just the most blatant version of that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=208.44s)]
*  I mean, look what Russia has done over the past several years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=214.92s)]
*  It's poisoned dissidents, both at home and outside the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=217.88s)]
*  It's kidnapped people, it's murdered people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=222.28s)]
*  The Russian state has no qualms about assaulting anybody. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=228.04s)]
*  And now, having met no real resistance, they've now carried that to a much higher level in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=231.56s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=238.84s)]
*  And also, I guess, I think you would point out, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  assaulting people, poisoning people beyond their borders. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=243.56s)]
*  This is something that some have called transnational repression. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  In other words, when the organs of an autocratic state reach across borders and attack either [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=251.16s)]
*  their own citizens or foreigners, and violating local laws, violating international law. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=258.76s)]
*  And this is something that's been happening repeatedly in a number of countries around [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=266.76s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=271.0s)]
*  And it has so far met no real resistance from the West or from the Western democracies. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=271.48s)]
*  And so, they feel kind of impunity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=276.76s)]
*  They're able to continue committing these crimes and nobody's particularly bothered by it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=279.56s)]
*  Well, that, of course, invites the question is, why are they facing no real resistance [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=283.48s)]
*  from democracies? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=290.2s)]
*  I mean, obviously, in the United States, we became very well acquainted with the former [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=291.56s)]
*  president's seemingly infatuation with the Russian president. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=296.76s)]
*  But you're writing recently, especially in your most recent article, you say that this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=303.4s)]
*  actually goes beyond that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=307.08s)]
*  It actually predates this refusal of the West to take this seriously. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=308.92s)]
*  Is there a moment that you could identify where this sort of refusal to take this seriously [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  became most obvious? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  And why do you think that is? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=321.16s)]
*  There are two phenomenon. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=323.16s)]
*  One is the phenomenon of actual fascination with autocracy that we saw in the Trump administration, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=324.6s)]
*  but we also see in some politicians in other democracies. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=329.8s)]
*  And in addition to that, there is on the other side of the political coin, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=333.88s)]
*  there is a refusal to believe that this is real. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  I think it really dates back, in fact, to the 1990s, when you had the beginnings of, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=342.12s)]
*  very soon, actually, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the beginnings of a revival of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=347.64s)]
*  Russian imperialism, which got no reaction in the West. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=351.32s)]
*  You saw it when there was a kind of theory in that era and it continued into the 2000s that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  if we just trade with Russia, if we trade with China, we will somehow, you know, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  we'll convince them to become part of our institutions, we'll democratize them by [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=366.52s)]
*  helping them get rich. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=371.56s)]
*  And all through that era, there was this illusion that if we just trade with them, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=373.32s)]
*  things will get better. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=377.24s)]
*  And actually, the opposite happened. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  It turned out that trading with autocracies makes the ruling parties or the leaders wealthy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=379.79999999999995s)]
*  and it doesn't make them more democratic or more liberal or more likely to abide by international [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  law at all. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  And so, really, this dates back quite a long way. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=394.12s)]
*  I mean, maybe an important break also probably happened during the Obama administration, when [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=397.32s)]
*  Obama didn't take the first invasion of Ukraine, the invasion of Crimea, quite as seriously. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  He thought it was a regional problem. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=407.72s)]
*  It was something that, you know, was Russia's problem with Ukraine. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=409.32s)]
*  And it didn't look to him, and to be fair, it didn't look to most people yet, like it was part [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=412.44s)]
*  of a larger pattern. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=417.32s)]
*  And I think the pattern has become clear, though, over the last eight years. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=419.16s)]
*  Talk about Hungary. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=423.56s)]
*  I mean, it's just been fascinating to watch Hungary's leader make—I don't know what you [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=424.68s)]
*  want to call it—some of these sort of goodwill missions around the world. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=429.88s)]
*  Even he was even warmly received in Israel by the prior administration of Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  And there are elections now coming up in which, you know, reporters are noting how, even though [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=439.8s)]
*  in the past, Viktor Orban has won elections which were reasonably free and fair, he has now [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=448.68s)]
*  changed the rules. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=455.08s)]
*  He's been changing the rules aggressively to advantage his own party. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=457.16s)]
*  Would you just talk about that? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=461.0s)]
*  And this has been happening in plain sight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=462.36s)]
*  None of this is a secret. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=464.12s)]
*  Yes, I would say it's actually been a while since there were free and fair elections in Hungary. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=466.92s)]
*  And the playing field gets more and more skewed all the time. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=471.24s)]
*  But yes, I mean, Viktor Orban offers to many Democrats who are tired of their own democracies [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=475.96s)]
*  or they dislike some aspect of their own countries or they're simply hungry for power, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=483.08s)]
*  he offers a model. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=487.32s)]
*  Here's how, as an elected Democrat—and the first time he was certainly elected—here's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  how you can take control of your country's institutions, undermine the media, undermine [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=493.32s)]
*  the courts, change the Constitution, change the electoral laws, you know, manipulate the results [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  of elections, and here's how you can stay in power indefinitely. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=504.36s)]
*  And that's a model that many people admire. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  Many Americans, members of the Republican Party admire it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=510.12s)]
*  Many people admire it in Poland or in France or in Germany. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=513.72s)]
*  You know, it's an appealing model if you're a Democratic politician who doesn't think in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=518.44s)]
*  a democracy, who doesn't think much of your own country or much of your own political system. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, the result in Hungary is going to be interesting to watch. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=528.04s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that Viktor Orban would allow anyone else to win. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=531.32s)]
*  I don't think that was ever really on the cards, but it will never be interesting to watch how [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=535.6400000000001s)]
*  it plays out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  And when you say taking over the media, taking over these institutions, could you just be a [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=541.48s)]
*  little bit more specific? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=545.96s)]
*  You mean literally taking—has literally taken over media institutions, or rather his [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=547.24s)]
*  sympathizers have? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=553.1600000000001s)]
*  Could you just be more specific about the way in which he's really bent what were [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=554.12s)]
*  independent institutions to his own purpose? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=558.76s)]
*  So what Orban has done, for example, to the media in Hungary is complicated. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=562.52s)]
*  It's not the same thing as an outright nationalization. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=569.0s)]
*  It's not censorship. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=572.5999999999999s)]
*  Instead, what he did was he manipulated the advertising market so that, you know, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=574.52s)]
*  particularly, you know, government companies would—state-owned companies would spend a lot [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=580.12s)]
*  of money on newspapers that were favorable to him, newspapers that were unfavorable to him, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=584.44s)]
*  or television stations would find the advertising market dried up. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, companies who advertise in those media would lose government contracts or would suffer [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  in other ways or would have tax inspections or something like that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=599.48s)]
*  And so essentially, he starved out the independent media. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=602.44s)]
*  And then as they began to go bankrupt, he arranged for his cronies, for people who were [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=605.6400000000001s)]
*  close to him politically, to buy up those properties. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=610.2s)]
*  So it was all legal, sort of, but it was a way of manipulating the market. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  And it was possible to do that because it's a relatively small country, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=620.5200000000001s)]
*  and, you know, and because, you know, the business community was quite craven, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=624.44s)]
*  and eventually they became quite afraid. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  So a lot of businesses eventually moved out of the country. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=629.72s)]
*  I mean, at the same time, he was creating his own set of oligarchs, so a set of business people [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=632.44s)]
*  who were essentially dependent on him and on his party for their business. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=638.2s)]
*  They got subsidies, they got contracts, they got deals. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  And some of them, these were private companies. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=646.6s)]
*  Nevertheless, they benefited from their relationship to him, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=649.0s)]
*  and those who didn't have that relationship suffered. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=651.96s)]
*  So he twisted the economy, he twisted the media market, and in that way took it over. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=654.28s)]
*  So in practice in Hungary, there is no real independent television. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=659.96s)]
*  Nobody watches television news that isn't pro-government. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=665.72s)]
*  And by pro-government, I mean viciously partisan, not just kind of biased, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=669.64s)]
*  but viciously, viciously and aggressively partisan. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's very difficult to find any media at all that's in the opposition. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=678.2800000000001s)]
*  There are a few websites run by very brave journalists, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=682.84s)]
*  but it's certainly not a balanced market, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=686.2s)]
*  and most Hungarians wouldn't see anything that's in opposition to the government at all. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=688.76s)]
*  And of course, the voter rules, and the voter rules, too, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=693.48s)]
*  sort of manipulating the rules around voter access. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=696.04s)]
*  So the other thing that Orbán did was he manipulated the constitution, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  he kept changing the rules about voting, he changed the rules about how you count [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=706.04s)]
*  a majority in Hungary, they have parliamentary politics, which is different from the US. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  But essentially, he manipulated the system so that even when he had a little tiny majority of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=716.68s)]
*  a couple of percentage points in the polls, he would have a huge majority in parliament, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=722.6s)]
*  which then gave him the constitutional majority, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=728.28s)]
*  enabling him to enact all kinds of deep changes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=731.64s)]
*  And so that was also a part of his system, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=735.16s)]
*  to change the political system in order to give his political party advantages. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=739.32s)]
*  Now, you cannot help but notice the similarities to some of the initiatives taking place in the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=743.96s)]
*  United States. In the United States, we are seeing similar movements, we are seeing people [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=750.04s)]
*  who are inventing fraud that doesn't exist in order to create a rationale for making it harder [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=753.8s)]
*  for certain people to vote, but not others, changing the forms of identification that people [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=760.52s)]
*  can use. I understand that you spend a good deal of your time overseas, but you're looking at both [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=766.52s)]
*  countries, I mean, you travel back and forth. And I wonder, do people see these similarities [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=771.3199999999999s)]
*  as part of a larger trend? So not only do people see these similarities, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=777.4s)]
*  and by the way, I do spend a lot of time in the US, but not only do people see these similarities, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=782.92s)]
*  there's a part of the Republican Party, and particularly a part of the conservative [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=787.24s)]
*  establishment, that now sees Hungary as a model. You know, it's CPAC, which is one of the most [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=790.92s)]
*  important conservative conferences, is being held in Budapest for a reason. You know, the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=797.88s)]
*  the, you know, leading conservative commentators, you know, Tucker Carlson from Fox News, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=805.32s)]
*  go to Budapest to broadcast for a reason. They go there because they see that manipulation of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=811.08s)]
*  democratic institutions as something they would like to do in the United States. So I think [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=818.28s)]
*  not only are they similar, I think they aren't, you know, the Americans are modeling themselves [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=822.92s)]
*  on what happened in Hungary, or some Americans, I don't want to say everybody, it's not the entire [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=829.16s)]
*  Republican Party, but a part of the Republican Party sees that as their goal. They also want [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=833.48s)]
*  to create a system whereby they have a party with a minority, a support of a minority of the country [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  that nevertheless controls everything indefinitely, or at least is, you know, for a very long time. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=845.48s)]
*  So yes, I think there's a direct relationship. I think it's a causal relationship. I think what [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  Orbán has done has been very influential on a part of the Republican Party. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=856.28s)]
*  So in your latest piece, you say there is no natural liberal order, and there are no rules [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=861.0s)]
*  without someone to enforce them. Unless democracies defend themselves together, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=867.16s)]
*  the forces of autocracy will destroy them. These are very strong words. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=872.04s)]
*  Talk a bit more about what are the steps that democratic nations need to embrace [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=877.24s)]
*  now with urgency to fight autocracies, not just here in this instance, but around the world and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=882.52s)]
*  going forward? So I think the immediate recognition that this liberal world order or these norms that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=889.56s)]
*  we talk about, you know, aren't real unless we defend them and unless we're willing to even [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=896.68s)]
*  militarily defend them is a very important realization that, and I don't think it's quite [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=901.0799999999999s)]
*  dawned on everybody yet, that, you know, that's the first piece of it. The second piece of it is [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=905.9599999999999s)]
*  the way in which we've enabled kleptocracy. We've allowed corruption to grow around the world, and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=912.8399999999999s)]
*  we've allowed corrupt people and politicians to infiltrate our systems, to use our banking system, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=918.28s)]
*  to hide their money, our property markets. You know, we've allowed their money to manipulate [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  even our political systems. Understanding that and fighting back, you know, ending tax havens, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=929.8s)]
*  you know, ending the shell company. Why do we need to have anonymous companies? For what reason? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=936.36s)]
*  Ending some of those practices, I mean, those are legal practices. They exist because [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=943.24s)]
*  some legislature passed a law. They can also be de-existed. I mean, they can be [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=947.08s)]
*  abolished in the same way. I would say that. I would say thirdly, thinking in a much deeper [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  and more profound way about how we communicate to the rest of the world. You know, the idea that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=957.0s)]
*  there's a marketplace of ideas and the best ideas will win, that's not true in a world in which, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, Viktor Orban owns all the newspapers and Vladimir Putin controls all of his television [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=965.96s)]
*  channels. So beginning to think about how we communicate our values, how we speak to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=971.32s)]
*  the inhabitants of autocracies and indeed of other democracies. That would be the third thing. I mean, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  the fourth thing, you know, is usually discussed in a different context, but, you know, there is [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=981.4000000000001s)]
*  now, there now is a double reason to end our dependence on carbon, on oil and gas, because oil [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=986.44s)]
*  and gas not only are polluting the planet, they are also the source of funding for, you know, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=994.12s)]
*  several major autocracies. You know, some of the most difficult, bloody and disruptive countries [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1001.24s)]
*  in the world, you know, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, these are all countries that [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1008.04s)]
*  exist and thrive because a small clique of people have got hold of natural resources and are able to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1012.68s)]
*  exploit them because the rest of the world is dependent on them for their energy use. You know, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1018.44s)]
*  time to move rapidly away from those sources of energy and to find something different, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1023.16s)]
*  both because of climate change and because those, you know, those things enable democracy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1029.0s)]
*  And then finally, I would say for, you know, for the inhabitants of democracies, taking this [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1034.84s)]
*  seriously, you know, maybe democracy isn't just a thing that's like tap water, you know, you just [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1041.24s)]
*  turn it on and it's always going to be there. Maybe it's something that's going to require [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1046.28s)]
*  you to participate in local institutions or to join a party or to help a campaign or to, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1050.04s)]
*  you know, work in even your local co-op board. I mean, whatever it is being engaged in public life [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1057.48s)]
*  is not, I think, optional anymore. You know, more people need to do it. They need to understand that [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  democracy only works to the extent that citizens are motivated to support it and participate in it. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1068.04s)]
*  Anne Epelbaum, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1075.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaldUNn-eOk&t=1078.04s)]
