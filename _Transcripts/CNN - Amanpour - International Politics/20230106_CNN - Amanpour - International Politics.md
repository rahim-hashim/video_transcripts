# Rogue Russia and Maximum Xi Top 10 Global Political Risks in 2023  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4)
*  Well, Putin's war in Ukraine is not the only global political risk set to loom over 2023. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  A series of international challenges lie ahead as China U-turns on its zero COVID policy, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=6.0s)]
*  and protests in Iran continue. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=11.88s)]
*  President of Eurasia Group Ian Bremmer talks to Walter Isaacson about what to expect on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=14.6s)]
*  the world stage this year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=18.52s)]
*  Thank you, Bianna, and Ian Bremmer, welcome to the show. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Great to be back with you, Walter. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Hey, until I read your latest thing, I was having a happy new year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=25.0s)]
*  I was thinking things were going pretty well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=28.16s)]
*  COVID's receding. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=30.0s)]
*  NATO is gathered together pretty well. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=31.32s)]
*  Russia's not doing that well in Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=35.12s)]
*  And we had a midterm elections that weren't as disruptive to democracy as we thought. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=37.44s)]
*  And yet I read your letter and you say it's the worst crises we face in 25 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=43.4s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=47.56s)]
*  Well, there's no question that there are a lot of things to be thankful for. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=48.72s)]
*  The fact that the U.S. democracy and indeed the world's major democracies are not on our [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=53.44s)]
*  top list is a very important thing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=58.12s)]
*  This is a very strong flashing don't panic sign because there is resilience in these [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=61.04s)]
*  institutions and even when leaders try to do things that are truly disruptive and break [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=67.32s)]
*  the system, plenty of checks and balances that prevent them from doing that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=72.8s)]
*  The problem, Walter, is that we are facing a global environment where a small number [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=77.04s)]
*  of individual actors, some of which are aging dictators, some of which are tech bros, there's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=83.88s)]
*  a little bit of overlap between those two groups, have an extraordinary amount of power. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=90.44s)]
*  They have no checks and balances. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=96.28s)]
*  They can make really bad decisions and they don't get a lot of great expertise in helping [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  them formulate those decisions. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=103.32s)]
*  Putin, of course, is the one who's made the worst decision of them, literally the worst [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=105.4s)]
*  misjudgment of any major leader on the global stage in decades and he's going to be paying [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  the consequences for that and the world is a lot more unstable as a consequence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=115.4s)]
*  But it's not just that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=120.08000000000001s)]
*  It's also Xi Jinping. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=121.2s)]
*  It's also Iran's supreme leader and it's also a small number of techno-centred billionaires [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  who also have the ability to make decisions that are deeply disruptive for global democracies [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  without a lot of ability to prevent them from doing that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=134.84s)]
*  So that's really where the risks are, very different than the kind of conversations we [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=138.12s)]
*  were having, say, on January 6th a couple years ago and yet in many ways much more problematic [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=141.88s)]
*  for the world economy, for geopolitics, than what was happening in the nation's capital. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=150.0s)]
*  You say we're resilient and that the disruptions are going to happen with people like Putin [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=155.56s)]
*  And yet this week we have seen what really is a weird show in the House of Representatives [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=160.72s)]
*  trying to elect a speaker. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  Even if it ends up that the dust all settling, doesn't this portend badly for things like [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=170.68s)]
*  having to raise the debt ceiling or having to do normal things that would keep our economy [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  afloat? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=180.68s)]
*  It's largely performative. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=181.68s)]
*  It is certainly true, Walter, that we haven't had a Speaker of the House vote go beyond [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=183.44s)]
*  the first vote in literally 100 years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=190.24s)]
*  So I mean, congratulations to the GOP for making some history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=194.16s)]
*  But we don't need the House in any urgent way to make legislation or pass rules or anything [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=199.04s)]
*  else that requires a speaker. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=205.36s)]
*  It's very exciting for cable news, don't get me wrong, but for a longer term conversation [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=206.76s)]
*  about the United States and how it is able to act as a leader on the global stage, ensure [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=212.28s)]
*  that its democracy functions. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=219.6s)]
*  What's happening in the House right now doesn't matter all that much. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=221.56s)]
*  And there are plenty of ways that you'll get through a debt ceiling in the second half [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=224.76s)]
*  of the year, irrespective of who the Speaker of the House turns out to be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  This week, the item where Putin said maybe we'll have a 36-hour ceasefire. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=232.12s)]
*  Why is it not in everybody's interest to say, let's just have a sustained ceasefire, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=238.4s)]
*  perhaps guaranteed by an international force, and calm this down? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=243.68s)]
*  Well, one, the Ukrainians do not want a ceasefire because so much of their land is illegally [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=248.32s)]
*  occupied by Russia. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=253.8s)]
*  And we're not just talking about Crimea, which was autonomous under independent Ukraine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=255.08s)]
*  We're talking about large amounts of territory that is majority Ukrainian, or at least was [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=260.42s)]
*  until the Russians came in, killed them and forced them to leave. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's unacceptable, not just to Ukraine, but to pretty much everybody in NATO. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=267.72s)]
*  So number one, you can't get Zelensky there after all the war crimes, after 40 percent [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=271.6s)]
*  economy contraction over the last 12 months, after millions of refugees. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=279.68s)]
*  But leaving that aside, there's a much bigger problem, Walter. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  And that is it is impossible to get Russia back to the status quo ante on February 23rd. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=287.16s)]
*  Even if you were to have a ceasefire, you're going to have a Ukraine which is massively [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=293.96s)]
*  more armed and capable right there on Russia's borders. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=298.26s)]
*  You're going to have an expanded NATO with forward deployments, thousands and thousands [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=301.88s)]
*  of troops, much more threatening to Russia than before. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=305.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, wait, couldn't we offer some security guarantees as part of a ceasefire? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, sure, but not as part of a ceasefire. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=312.2s)]
*  The security guarantees, if they were to come, would have to come on the basis of a settlement, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=314.64s)]
*  not a ceasefire. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=319.44s)]
*  And we're very, very far from that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=320.44s)]
*  So the point is that you can I can imagine through exhaustion, through an inability to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=322.16s)]
*  continue to fight, that at some point you could actually get much reduced fighting on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=327.56s)]
*  the front lines. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  But Russia will be defeated and humiliated on the global stage. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=332.8s)]
*  Their life will be so much more. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=337.8s)]
*  After the Cuban Missile Crisis, when both sides said, OK, this is stupid, let's take [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  a step back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=343.1s)]
*  The Soviets were in the same position they were before the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=344.36s)]
*  That's what's not possible here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Russia has made itself into a rogue state where they're never going to be providing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  gas to the Europeans anymore. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=356.0s)]
*  Nord Stream one and two have been sabotaged. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=358.32s)]
*  We don't know actually by who, but we know that the Europeans have spent massive amounts [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=360.44s)]
*  of money to ensure they'll never have to buy gas from Russia again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=364.96s)]
*  So wait, what does it mean to have a rogue Russia? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=369.4s)]
*  Well, that's a good question, Walter. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=372.44s)]
*  What it means, think about a rogue Iran, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=374.55999999999995s)]
*  I mean, Iran is the country we think of as a rogue state that's on a lot of our minds. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=377.44s)]
*  It's a country that doesn't have nuclear weapons, unlike Russia, but they're the principal threat [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=381.84s)]
*  to stability in the Middle East. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  And what's that about? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=389.29999999999995s)]
*  It's about proxy war and terrorist attacks and cyber attacks and espionage and drone [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  attacks and ballistic missile attacks. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=396.67999999999995s)]
*  So a Russia as a rogue state for NATO would be a country that is a perpetual threat for [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  those countries, the way that Iran is a threat to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, to the UAE. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=406.36s)]
*  That's a very serious problem. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=411.8s)]
*  That's what happens when the peace dividend is over in Europe and you have a war. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=413.64s)]
*  Remember, the war that's going on right now with Ukraine is a proxy war with NATO. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  NATO is fighting Russia. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=423.72s)]
*  Now, they're fighting Russia using Western intelligence, Western weapons. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=425.24s)]
*  They don't have soldiers on the ground in Ukraine. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=429.32s)]
*  They're not doing a no-fly zone. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=431.68s)]
*  So you don't have American fighter jets knocking Russian jets out of the sky. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=433.2s)]
*  But from the Russian perspective, this is a war and it's a war that they're losing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=437.44s)]
*  A temporary ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine does nothing to improve Putin's strategic [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=442.4s)]
*  position as a consequence of that, Walter. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=448.28s)]
*  One of your prescient predictions last year, and I give you credit for it, was that President [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=451.0s)]
*  Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy wasn't going to work, that there would be protests against [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=456.4s)]
*  it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, now tell me what's next now that he's changed that policy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, first of all, what's next is that Xi Jinping increasingly is running his country [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=467.04s)]
*  the way Putin runs his country. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  One of the things that we could count on in China, even though it's an authoritarian state, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=475.12s)]
*  is that they were very thoughtful about long-term strategic policy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=480.32s)]
*  They were getting all sorts of expert inputs from technocrats, from hardliners, from pragmatic [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=484.3s)]
*  people that wanted a more market-oriented economy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=492.24s)]
*  Xi Jinping in his last 10 years has consolidated authority in historic ways, and he now has [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=495.32s)]
*  more power inside China than any leader since Mao. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=501.76s)]
*  But in the days of Mao, China didn't have that much impact for the global economy or [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=505.04s)]
*  for global political institutions or for national security, for that matter. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  Now they do. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=514.54s)]
*  The fact that Xi Jinping decided literally on a dime to go from the most locked down [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=515.92s)]
*  COVID policy to the least and isn't providing any data, any transparency on the numbers [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=523.28s)]
*  of cases, the numbers of deaths, or any new variants that might be popping up from what [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=531.16s)]
*  is right now the global epicenter of the COVID pandemic in China means that there are all [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=537.12s)]
*  sorts of dangers that emanate from China on the pandemic front. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=543.56s)]
*  I wish it was only that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  But of course, when you have a leader with that much power that can make that kind of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=548.88s)]
*  a decision on COVID, you're going to see decisions like that made in the global economy as well, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=552.4s)]
*  in technology issues, on national security. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=556.92s)]
*  As much as the U.S.-China relationship is vastly more stable than the U.S.-Russia relationship, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  and both leaders want it to remain so, there is going to be a greater level of decoupling [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=565.92s)]
*  by Western multinationals away from China because of that extraordinary uncertainty, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=571.04s)]
*  because they're not getting the data out of China's economy, because they don't understand [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  what might happen in a week, in a month, in three months' time. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=580.5999999999999s)]
*  Do you mean that American corporations, whether it be Apple or Tesla and others, are going [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=583.48s)]
*  to have to pull out of China? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=590.16s)]
*  I don't think they're going to have to pull out of China at all. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=591.64s)]
*  I think there are very few corporations that will be required to pull out of China. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=593.76s)]
*  There are, of course, export controls that the United States has started levying in China [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=597.64s)]
*  back last October on advanced semiconductors that are seen as dual-use for both the economy [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  and for military purposes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=607.8s)]
*  If you were doing business in that sector, you can't do that business in China anymore. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=609.8199999999999s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=613.68s)]
*  And if you're Google or Facebook and you wanted to do business with all of your data acquisition [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=614.68s)]
*  and search and social media, China won't let you in. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=619.6s)]
*  Most corporations can still do any business they want to do in China. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  The point is that increasingly that business looks more dangerous. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=627.44s)]
*  It looks more risky. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=630.48s)]
*  So they don't want to have to pay so much for it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=632.1s)]
*  That's why Apple is increasingly moving a lot of its production away from China. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=634.12s)]
*  They're not being forced to do it legally by the United States. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=638.9200000000001s)]
*  They're just concerned about what the future portends inside the Chinese economy with the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  Xi Jinping that they don't have a very good read on. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  They could make sudden, very different decisions about the technology sector or others. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  And so Apple's moving more to Vietnam and to other places around the world. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of major U.S. corporations are increasingly going to look to friend shore, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=656.92s)]
*  to insure as opposed to have so much of their global production inside China. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=663.12s)]
*  Why is there such a lack of global leadership these days? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  I think there are a lot of reasons for that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=674.56s)]
*  One is because there's a feeling in many populations that their leaders ignored their own working [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=677.2199999999999s)]
*  and middle classes. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=684.96s)]
*  That has led to a my country first perspective. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=687.52s)]
*  It's not just America first under Trump. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=690.2s)]
*  Biden's U.S. foreign policy for an American middle class is also a functional understanding [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=692.6s)]
*  that if we're not getting the message through to Main Street in the United States, we don't [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=698.96s)]
*  want to be involved in wars around the world. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=703.24s)]
*  Now, Ukraine has been the exception. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=706.16s)]
*  And Walter, we have seen a lot of leadership from the United States on Ukraine, not just [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=708.2s)]
*  militarily, but diplomatically and economically. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=714.04s)]
*  It's made the G7 stronger. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=716.76s)]
*  It's made NATO stronger. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  But your question even fits there because the developing world looks at the West and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=719.8s)]
*  says you only care about Ukraine because it's a bunch of white people in Europe. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=725.7199999999999s)]
*  If that was happening in Ethiopia or the DRC or Yemen, you wouldn't say boo. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=729.52s)]
*  So why are we going to take food prices, fertilizer and energy prices on the chin? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=734.5999999999999s)]
*  Why should we support your sanctions and your votes when you don't care about us? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=739.84s)]
*  And that also makes it harder to have global leadership when a majority of the world's [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  eight billion people don't trust that the United States, Japan, Germany, other wealthy [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=748.64s)]
*  countries are going to lift a finger for them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=753.96s)]
*  We're called donor countries, the wealthy democracies in the world. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=756.96s)]
*  And yet if you're sitting in a country like India or in sub-Saharan African countries, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=761.32s)]
*  you think that you're the ones that are doing the donating. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=766.48s)]
*  It's your human capital and labor. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=769.0s)]
*  It's your resources that are getting exploited. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=771.0s)]
*  And yet you're the charity cases in the world. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=773.68s)]
*  They really angers them. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=776.04s)]
*  And that's another reason why we have a harder time with global leadership right now. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=777.64s)]
*  How do you see the protests in Iran playing out? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=781.64s)]
*  The protests in Iran are clearly, there's no useful response by the Iranian government. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=785.52s)]
*  It's months now. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=793.44s)]
*  The only thing they've said is more repression. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=795.0s)]
*  They're not going to in any way take their demands on board. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=797.16s)]
*  You're not looking at regime change in the near future. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=801.9599999999999s)]
*  The numbers of people that are demonstrating still comparatively small, even though it's [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=804.76s)]
*  all over the country. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=807.92s)]
*  And there are no particular leaders of this opposition. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=809.16s)]
*  It's been really grassroots from the young people, particularly women, all over the country. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=813.04s)]
*  But it comes at the same time that the Iranians are nearing breakout nuclear capability. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=817.76s)]
*  And there's no possibility of going back to a nuclear deal. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=822.86s)]
*  The Americans would never provide that, given what they're doing to the people on the ground, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=825.82s)]
*  and the Iranians won't take the risk to compromise. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=829.6600000000001s)]
*  And then, as we mentioned before, the Iranians are doing the most to provide support for [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  Russia right now in this war. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=837.38s)]
*  So you put all of that together with the new Israeli right-wing government led by Netanyahu. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=839.38s)]
*  The potential for military confrontation in the Middle East has actually gone up quite [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  a bit. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=849.46s)]
*  Let me go back to the fact that Iran will get some form of nuclear weaponry soon. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=850.54s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=857.9599999999999s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  What should we do? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=859.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's certainly not guaranteed that they will acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  There are major risks to Iran's own national security if they were to either make those [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=866.26s)]
*  moves and it was found out or announced that they were going to make those moves. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=872.16s)]
*  But part of the problem is that where they're stockpiling and doing their advanced high-grade [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=876.9s)]
*  uranium enrichment right now is buried deep under a mountain. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=882.9s)]
*  And Israeli national security advisors will tell you that they don't have credible military [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=886.74s)]
*  options to disrupt or destroy that nuclear capability. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=893.1s)]
*  It's not like 10, 20 years ago. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=898.86s)]
*  So you want to put pressure on them, yes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=901.06s)]
*  You want to prevent them from going nuclear, yes. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=903.82s)]
*  But at the same time, the Americans wanted to prevent Pakistan from going nuclear, India [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=906.82s)]
*  from going nuclear. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=910.74s)]
*  We had sanctions on those countries for years as a consequence. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=911.74s)]
*  Well, wait, are you saying that Iran might go nuclear and we would just let it happen? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=913.98s)]
*  I'm saying Iran might go nuclear. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=918.38s)]
*  We would be extremely angry about it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=921.24s)]
*  I'm sure we'd put more sanctions on. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=923.82s)]
*  And ultimately, I suspect we'd learn to live with it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=926.6600000000001s)]
*  And I'm not happy about that at all, but we've done that with North Korea. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=930.42s)]
*  I mean, our policy is denuclearization. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=934.3399999999999s)]
*  It is unacceptable for North Korea to have nuclear weapons, but it's a little like the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=937.06s)]
*  Princess Bride. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=941.66s)]
*  Unacceptable may not mean what we think it means. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=943.4599999999999s)]
*  We're now at the second anniversary of the January 6th insurrection. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=945.66s)]
*  And in a weird way, we've seen its echoes even in the dysfunction in the House of Representatives [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=951.2199999999999s)]
*  this week. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=958.18s)]
*  To what extent do you think we have recovered or can recovered from that threat to our democracy? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=959.8s)]
*  I think we have recovered from that specific threat to our democracy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=966.68s)]
*  I think that after January 6th, there was a tail risk, small but real and growing, that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=972.12s)]
*  the U.S. could be heading for a constitutional crisis in the presidential election in 2024. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  So Trump, for example, becomes the Republican nominee. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=986.94s)]
*  It's a close election. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=990.9000000000001s)]
*  Say he loses, but you have people in positions of power overseeing state elections, secretaries [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=992.36s)]
*  of state, governors that decide that they're going to help him try to steal the election. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=997.9000000000001s)]
*  He can't overturn it, but he can break it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1002.24s)]
*  I think that the potential of that happening in 2024 is now virtually zero. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1004.44s)]
*  Not because Democrats were able to hold the Senate or because there wasn't a red wave. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1010.24s)]
*  Rather, because truly incompetent people running for some core positions that would [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1015.68s)]
*  oversee state elections, those people lost. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1021.78s)]
*  And so you just don't have people in positions of power that are prepared to try to steal [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1026.86s)]
*  or break the election. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1031.54s)]
*  Remember, when Trump tried to do that after January 6th and then the run up to January [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1032.8999999999999s)]
*  6th, when he was calling Republican Party members in Georgia and Arizona, find me some [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1037.8999999999999s)]
*  votes, I want to steal this election. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1041.8999999999999s)]
*  That's basically what he did. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1043.74s)]
*  And he found that in the January 6th committee investigations, Republican Party members rank [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1044.8s)]
*  and file said no. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1050.04s)]
*  And they said no because fundamentally they may be conservative, they may be Republican, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1051.68s)]
*  doesn't matter. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1055.76s)]
*  They're American. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1056.76s)]
*  And first and foremost, they believe in rule of law, just like the police do, just like [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1057.76s)]
*  the military does. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1062.36s)]
*  And it turns out that that really matters in a country like the United States. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1063.92s)]
*  The U.S. was tested and the U.S. responded. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1067.48s)]
*  And I think at least in the near term, plenty of deep structural challenges with democracy [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1071.14s)]
*  in the United States that we could address on many, many shows in the future. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1076.04s)]
*  But specifically to answer your question on January 6th, we do not face a proximate crisis [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1080.2s)]
*  of democracy in this country. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1085.46s)]
*  Ian Bremmer, as always, thank you for joining us. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1087.24s)]
*  Thanks so much, Walter. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftD_qoqbjQ4&t=1100.94s)]
