# Dunja Mijatović on Russia's Suspension From U.N. Human Rights Council | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ)
*  The European Union has been very, very clear, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and they have launched all sorts of punitive measures [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=3.64s)]
*  against Russia and against the Putin regime, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  including the UN Human Rights Council [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=9.14s)]
*  has actually managed to isolate Russia [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=11.74s)]
*  a little bit further internationally [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=14.58s)]
*  by having it suspend itself from, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=16.34s)]
*  or suspending it from, that council. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=18.54s)]
*  What is your reaction to that, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=20.94s)]
*  and how do you think that will be effective? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=22.44s)]
*  Well, I do hope it will be effective. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=26.78s)]
*  There is a need, and I think these were strong, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=30.220000000000002s)]
*  strong political signals. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=33.52s)]
*  I can talk about myself and my engagement [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=35.52s)]
*  with Russian Federation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=38.22s)]
*  I think we all, in international organizations, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=39.72s)]
*  we reached the limit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=42.72s)]
*  We tried everything. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=44.72s)]
*  And these measures, excluding or suspending [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=47.02s)]
*  a member state from different international organizations, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=50.22s)]
*  of course, is not something we'd like to see. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=52.96s)]
*  But if you have a member state starting the war, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=56.22s)]
*  bombing the cities, then of course, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=60.72s)]
*  there are measures that need to be taken [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=63.92s)]
*  in order to really raise the alarm [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=67.22s)]
*  and to say stop the war, stop the killing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=69.72s)]
*  I was on my way to Zubdidi, to Abkhazia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=72.98s)]
*  I was in Georgia when a colleague of mine [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=76.18s)]
*  told me in a car they're bombing Kiev. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=79.62s)]
*  And of course, it brought the memories [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=82.44s)]
*  of Sarajevo being bombed and all these horrifying scenes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=85.28s)]
*  that we saw in Pucha and other places. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=89.64s)]
*  And it is extremely difficult to understand [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=93.44s)]
*  the reasoning behind it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=98.74s)]
*  What can be more important than human life? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=100.17999999999999s)]
*  No politics, no issues related to all these excuses [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=106.38s)]
*  that we heard in the last month and a half [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=110.92s)]
*  on why this war has started. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=113.52s)]
*  I mean, this is not going to bring any happiness [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=115.62s)]
*  to people or to societies as a whole. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=120.38s)]
*  So I think this is the moment that there are also [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  certain changes in order to see international organizations [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=129.62s)]
*  being more capable of achieving peace and helping countries [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=133.28s)]
*  that are in a similar situation as Ukraine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  Of course, my mandate is very limited. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=142.08s)]
*  I'm human rights commissioner. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=144.28s)]
*  I work with human rights defenders, with journalists. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=146.54s)]
*  I make sure that journalists can be safe [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=149.88s)]
*  and there are already cases of journalists being killed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=152.04s)]
*  in Ukraine and also attacked, including CNN crew. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  So this is also something that I can engage with. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=160.28s)]
*  But none of this is going to be fruitful [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=163.98s)]
*  and we will not see the real results [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=167.62s)]
*  if the shooting and bombing does not stop. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ARDGRYkyQ&t=171.46s)]
