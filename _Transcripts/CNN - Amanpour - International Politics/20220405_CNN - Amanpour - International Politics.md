# Lithuanian Prime Minister Russia Has Overbeaten Goebbels By Far  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0)
*  Can I just ask you to react to President Zelensky's most impassioned speech to the UN? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the body that is meant to be able to help, you know, wage peace in the midst of war, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=6.8s)]
*  and yet he called out the council and he called out Russia for being a member that is constantly thwarting that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=12.48s)]
*  What is your reaction to him saying that, you know, Security Council may no longer be fit for purpose? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=19.52s)]
*  Well, it is, I don't know, I find little argument of disagreement here, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=26.16s)]
*  because basically what we see in this circumstance is that somebody is trying to be a judge in his own case. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=34.4s)]
*  And we know that in a civilized world this is not the principle that we follow. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=41.76s)]
*  And definitely we find it a hurdle that cannot be overcome, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=46.32s)]
*  because Russia will never ever look objectively at what it is doing, and it does not even have a purpose of doing this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=53.28s)]
*  I mean, their purpose is to portray the situation exactly the opposite from what it looks like. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=62.56s)]
*  And we've heard this guy of theirs, Nibenza, today with a slip of tongue when he was actually saying what is happening, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=71.36s)]
*  that there were no corpses before the Russian invasion, and we all know that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=78.08s)]
*  But what Russia is doing, they are just trying to put the things, you know, their feet up and head down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  And definitely that doesn't help to strengthen security, neither in Europe nor globally. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  So as you mentioned, Ambassador Nibenza basically also called it, I mean, he directly addressed Zelensky afterwards and said, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=98.64s)]
*  you know, basically this is false that these images are created. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=105.04s)]
*  We all know that's not true because there is the repeated evidence of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=109.44s)]
*  And they were the only ones there when those corpses ended up in such a terrible situation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=114.48s)]
*  And at the same time, they publish an article in one of their propaganda resources in how they are going to denazify Ukraine, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=124.16s)]
*  which is pretty much, you know, I've been thinking about Kafka and Orwell a month and a half ago [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=131.6s)]
*  when Putin was explaining his views on how the world is arranged and the countries and their sovereignty. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=138.24s)]
*  But now I must say that they've overbeaten Goebbels by far. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=144.56s)]
*  You [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU4iGFHXit0&t=154.0s)]
