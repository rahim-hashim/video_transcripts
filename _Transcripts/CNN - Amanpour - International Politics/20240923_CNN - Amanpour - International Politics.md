Video Description: World leaders are meeting at the annual U.N. General Assembly against a grim backdrop of global conflict and deepening geopolitical divisions. In the Middle East, war conditions are escalating. Lebanon reports a death toll of at least 274 on the deadliest day since the 2006 war, after Israel conducted extensive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across the country. Talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza are at a standstill. Yet diplomacy can sometimes yield results. One year ago, Siamak Namazi was released from Iran's notorious Evin Prison in a hostage-prisoner swap with the United States. His was the longest period of imprisonment of any American in Iran -- a horrifying eight-year ordeal. Six months before his release, Namazi bravely called in to this program from inside Evin to make an emotional appeal to President Biden. One year later he is ready to talk for the first time, in an exclusive with Christiane in New York.

# Eight Years in Iranian Captivity An Exclusive Interview with Siamak Namazi  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U)
*  This time last year, Siomak Namazi was released from Iran's notorious Evin prison in a hostage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=0.0s)]
*  prisoner swap with the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  He was the longest-held American in Iran, a horrifying eight-year ordeal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=9.0s)]
*  Now, six months before his release, Namazi had bravely called into this program from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=13.6s)]
*  inside Evin to make an emotional plea to President Biden. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=18.8s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  The other hostages and I desperately need President Biden to finally hear us out, to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=24.52s)]
*  finally hear our cry for help and bring us home. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  Eventually, he and four other Iranian Americans were released, and a year later, he is ready [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=33.48s)]
*  to talk for the first time in this exclusive interview right here in New York City. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=38.72s)]
*  Siomak, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=44.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=46.32s)]
*  The last time you talked to us was from Evin jail in March of 2023, and it took another [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=47.64s)]
*  several months for you to be free. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=54.52s)]
*  A year ago, you came back to the United States almost exactly a year ago. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=55.96s)]
*  What's this year been like? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=61.24s)]
*  Do you feel free? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=62.64s)]
*  Well, Christian, first of all, it is such a joy to be talking to you and not worrying [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=63.64s)]
*  about someone dragging me to a solitary cell somewhere because of it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=72.84s)]
*  Do I feel free? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=76.8s)]
*  I think the first, the most dominant feeling that I have is gratitude. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=78.92s)]
*  I owe a huge debt of gratitude to many people, particularly President Biden, who made a very [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=86.08s)]
*  difficult choice and struck the deal. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=91.08s)]
*  I'm sure it was a very difficult deal for him to strike that brought us home. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=94.84s)]
*  It took many more years than I hoped that it would. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=100.08s)]
*  I was there eight years. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=103.4s)]
*  The longest held. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=106.6s)]
*  The longest held. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=107.6s)]
*  But the truth is, when you get out of a dungeon after eight years, you don't just return to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=108.6s)]
*  a normal life. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=114.32s)]
*  It's overly optimistic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  You don't just kind of shake it off. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  It's an eight-year earthquake that hits your life, and it leaves a lot of destruction. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  But I would say I do feel very free in the U.S., and I tried to live the freest life [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=125.6s)]
*  I could even when I was in Evin. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=132.44s)]
*  What were the basics? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=134.76s)]
*  You had to learn to live outside those confines again. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=135.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=140.72s)]
*  Human beings are very interesting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=141.84s)]
*  We adapt to where we are. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=144.56s)]
*  So I would say it takes a long time to learn to adapt to prison, and then it takes a long [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=146.12s)]
*  time to learn to adapt to come out. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=152.76s)]
*  It's a very difficult process. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=156.2s)]
*  I remember having to set an alarm to remind myself to leave the apartment. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=159.72s)]
*  I remember once I hadn't left for three days, and I realized why. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=164.36s)]
*  I just wasn't used to doing that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=169.12s)]
*  So yeah, there's a lot to learn again. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=173.72000000000003s)]
*  Carrying keys, carrying a wallet, cars. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=178.36s)]
*  Eight years is a long, long, long time. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=182.28000000000003s)]
*  Society changes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=185.4s)]
*  I felt for my oxygenarian parents that I didn't know how to do simple things. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  A friend would say, grab an Uber and come over. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=196.27999999999997s)]
*  And I would have to explain I have absolutely no idea how to do that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  You come out with no IDs, accounts frozen, and yeah, it takes a while. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  Did the U.S. government, did they give you the sort of building blocks, the stepping [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=214.32s)]
*  stones to come out or what? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=220.2s)]
*  No. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=222.6s)]
*  I think that's something that needs to be worked on, because you could imagine that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=223.6s)]
*  even when hardened criminals get out of prison here, there'd be a dozen church programs and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  state programs and federal programs to reintegrate. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  For us, it's a goodbye, good luck. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=236.48s)]
*  There are some wonderful NGOs that former hostages and their families usually volunteer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=239.6s)]
*  in and there's some wonderful, wonderful people who reach out to you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's their goodness that helps us maneuver through it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=251.64s)]
*  But no, there really isn't. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=256.36s)]
*  And what about debriefing? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=258.24s)]
*  You had spent all these years in captivity by one of America's biggest adversaries. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=261.24s)]
*  They want to know, surely, about the Revolutionary Guard, about how you were treated, about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=267.44s)]
*  what things might have been said or done. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=272.08s)]
*  Did you? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=274.36s)]
*  There has been no debriefing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=275.36s)]
*  But just to be clear, the U.S. government did not come and plumb you for your experience, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=276.36s)]
*  your information, your knowledge about this regime? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=284.32s)]
*  No, and oddly, because, you know, eight years, I would say, probably in this country, I have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=287.68s)]
*  the most, I've clocked the most hours negotiating with the Revolutionary Guards. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=293.52s)]
*  But no, there has been no debriefings. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=298.32s)]
*  I asked the other hostages, the ones that I have asked have all said there are no debriefings. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=302.96s)]
*  So yes, I was pretty surprised by that as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=309.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=323.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwncy9ATy1U&t=324.52s)]
