Video Description: Both Iraq and Iran claim that, when he was killed, Soleimani was in Baghdad to discuss easing tensions between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia. Both Saudi officials and the U.S. Secretary of State reject that claim, but the Saudis are nonetheless leading the effort for a de-escalation of tensions. Christiane discusses Saudi concerns with Turki Al-Faisal, the former Saudi Ambassador to the U.S.

# Former Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. on De-Escalation Efforts in Iran | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw)
*  Well, it's a very, very tense situation, especially for your region and your nation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=0.0s)]
*  A very senior Saudi defense official has been to the White House, to the Pentagon, to try [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=4.16s)]
*  to talk to the U.S. about this escalating crisis. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=10.84s)]
*  Have you heard anything back? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  And do you believe... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=15.6s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=16.6s)]
*  Do you believe that Saudi Arabia can get this de-escalated? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=17.6s)]
*  Well, I hope so. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=20.6s)]
*  I'm not in the government loop, of course, but the King has been in touch with the president [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=22.72s)]
*  of Iraq and Prince Mohammed has been in touch with the prime minister of Iraq calling for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=27.32s)]
*  de-escalation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=32.56s)]
*  The kingdom does not want more conflict in the area, as has been shown consistently in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  the past few years. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  And if I can just remind you that when Iran attacked the Aramco oil field, the kingdom [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  kept its cool and did not respond in kind. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=49.56s)]
*  So we're not looking for war. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  We want to de-escalate and we want people to be in a peaceful mode. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=55.12s)]
*  Do you believe that you will have any success with that message, given the fact that we [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  all know that you tried to have the same influence on President George W. Bush before they launched [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=64.32s)]
*  the war in Iraq in 2003? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=70.64s)]
*  I was in Riyadh. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=72.92s)]
*  I covered yours and the kingdom's efforts to de-escalate before that war. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=73.92s)]
*  I really can't say. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=79.16s)]
*  I wish I had a crystal ball to tell you what the future will hold. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=80.24s)]
*  But I think the kingdom's word is heard not only in the White House, but throughout the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  area as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that it will come to war? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=92.76s)]
*  Do you think either accidentally or by a cycle of tit-for-tat escalation that it could tip [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  over into the worst-case scenario? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=102.72s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  I think if the Iranians keep their cool and not be bombastic and increase the tension [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=106.12s)]
*  and so on, that maybe, maybe we can get over this situation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=115.96s)]
*  But it's a long-running thing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=120.4s)]
*  Let me just remind you, Ms. Amanpour, since the start of the Iranian revolution, Iran [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=122.4s)]
*  has been the provocative entity in the area with the, remember, the hijacking of the embassy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=128.12s)]
*  in Tehran and other activities culminating in the bombing of the Aramco oil fields in [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  So it is, they have to show a bit of wisdom and reticence to adhere to the bombastic attitudes [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=142.68s)]
*  that they've taken over the years. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcuwjKY_PSw&t=152.24s)]
