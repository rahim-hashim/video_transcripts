*  It's great to be with you, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=48.68s)]
*  Walter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=49.44s)]
*  This startlingly honest book is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=49.84s)]
*  called Tough Love. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=52.64s)]
*  And having read it, I now realize [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  where the tough love comes from. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=56.28s)]
*  You know, your upbringing was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  both loving and really tough. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=60.04s)]
*  Let's start by asking about your [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=62.68s)]
*  father. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  Tell me about him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=64.72s)]
*  Well, my father, Emmett Rice, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=66.08s)]
*  was born in segregated South [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Carolina in 1920. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=69.46s)]
*  And he rose ultimately to be a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=71.62s)]
*  governor of the Federal Reserve, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=75.46s)]
*  appointed by President Carter. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=77.56s)]
*  But his childhood and his [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=79.8s)]
*  upbringing was very difficult [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=81.94s)]
*  because not only he lost his [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=83.5s)]
*  father when he was seven years [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=85.44s)]
*  old, and that sent their family [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=86.58s)]
*  into economic decline, but he [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=89.52s)]
*  was really steeped in the most [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=92.12s)]
*  insidious form of Southern [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  bigotry and prejudice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=97.2s)]
*  When World War II broke out, he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=99.16s)]
*  was drafted and ended up serving [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=101.84s)]
*  at Tuskegee with the famed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=105.0s)]
*  Tuskegee Airmen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  That experience of serving in a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=107.94s)]
*  segregated Air Force and fighting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=110.34s)]
*  for freedom for everybody but [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=112.78s)]
*  his own people was a very, very [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  searing experience for him. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=118.5s)]
*  And unlike many people, myself [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=119.74s)]
*  included, who look at the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=122.14s)]
*  experience of the Tuskegee [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  Airmen as African Americans with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  pride to say, look, we finally [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=128.04s)]
*  showed the world what we could [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=130.18s)]
*  do, that we could fight and be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=132.48s)]
*  as talented and effective as any [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=134.26s)]
*  white person. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=138.22s)]
*  My father's view was that that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=139.32s)]
*  was basically BS, that we had [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=140.56s)]
*  nothing to prove, that his job, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=142.6s)]
*  my job, our jobs as human beings [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=144.86s)]
*  were not to prove to white people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=147.72s)]
*  that we were as good as them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  That should be obvious. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  He gave you a bunch of lessons. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  He wrote them down even. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  He gave us tons of lessons, and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  one of them about race was, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=157.3s)]
*  this came later in his career, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=160.9s)]
*  after he got his PhD in economics [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  and after he rose to some measure [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=164.28s)]
*  of professional success, he [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=165.78s)]
*  concluded that if race is going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  to cause a problem, it's not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=170.18s)]
*  going to be for me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=172.82000000000002s)]
*  Let it be for somebody else. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=173.96s)]
*  And his ultimate mantra was don't [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=175.76s)]
*  take crap off of anybody, meaning [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  that be you, be you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=180.4s)]
*  You do your best. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=181.94s)]
*  Believe in yourself. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=182.74s)]
*  And don't let anybody tell you [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=184.04s)]
*  you can't or stand in your way. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=185.14s)]
*  And, you know, I'm better or worse. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=188.68s)]
*  Hey, that's a theme in the book. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=190.54s)]
*  It's like you're not taking crap [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=192.74s)]
*  from anybody. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  I took that message to heart for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=195.38s)]
*  better or for worse. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=197.18s)]
*  And your mother, Lois Wright. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=198.02s)]
*  My mother was extraordinary, too. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=199.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=200.62s)]
*  She came from a family that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  immigrated to Maine, Portland, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=205.18s)]
*  Maine from Jamaica in 1912. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  My grandparents on my mom's side [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=209.72s)]
*  had virtually no formal education. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=212.12s)]
*  One was a janitor, one was a maid [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=214.12s)]
*  and a seamstress. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=215.96s)]
*  And they came to this country just [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=217.3s)]
*  like so many other immigrants in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=218.56s)]
*  search of economic opportunity and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=219.9s)]
*  education for their kids. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  They had five kids. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  My mother was the youngest. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  My mother was the valedictorian of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  her high school class in Portland, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  Maine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  She was student government [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  president. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=230.9s)]
*  She was a champion debater. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=231.46s)]
*  She just knocked the lights out [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=233.56s)]
*  and she got admitted to Radcliffe. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=236.16s)]
*  But because my grandfather, who was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=238.16s)]
*  working as a janitor in a music [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=239.74s)]
*  store, had a catastrophic accident [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=241.2s)]
*  about 18 months before my mom was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=243.44s)]
*  to go to college, he broke his back, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=245.54s)]
*  shattered his feet and spent months [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=247.88s)]
*  in the hospital so that all of their [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=249.88s)]
*  savings were drained. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=252.04s)]
*  And my mom applied for a scholarship [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=253.68s)]
*  from the Committee of the State of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=255.66s)]
*  Maine that's supposed to provide [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=257.72s)]
*  scholarships to kids going to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=259.02s)]
*  Radcliffe. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=260.97999999999996s)]
*  And my mom was a shoe in because [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=262.62s)]
*  she'd been valedictorian of Portland [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=264.88s)]
*  High School. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=266.62s)]
*  And she was denied that scholarship [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=267.62s)]
*  because the lady who ran the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=269.32s)]
*  committee told her [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=271.38s)]
*  that the purpose of the scholarship [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=273.9s)]

*  back to Maine and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=277.7s)]
*  move in the proper social circles [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=279.7s)]

*  raise money for it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=283.5s)]
*  And because you're black, you won't be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  able to do that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=286.38s)]
*  And so the end of the story is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  her principal in high school and her [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=289.62s)]
*  debate coach went directly to Radcliffe [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  and asked them to give her the money. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  And they did. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=295.56s)]
*  And so my mother made her life's work [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=296.62s)]
*  before she went into the private sector, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=299.26000000000005s)]

*  people in this country to be able to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=303.42s)]
*  attend. And that's why in some ways she [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=305.38s)]
*  helps push the Pell Grant. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=307.3s)]
*  Yeah. Well, when she died, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=308.62s)]
*  you know, her obituary said mother [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  of the Pell Grant because she [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  had worked for many years, along with [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=316.38s)]
*  Senator Claiborne Pell to make that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  grant program accessible. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=321.26s)]
*  And, Walter, I can't tell you how proud [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=322.76s)]
*  I am. 80 million Americans [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=324.8s)]
*  have been able to go to college because [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=326.9s)]
*  of that Pell Grant program. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=328.44s)]
*  How did you first meet President [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=329.96s)]
*  Obama? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=332.24s)]
*  I first met him in the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  summer of 2004 [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=336.74s)]
*  when he was running for Senate [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  from Illinois. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=341.12s)]
*  And I was working for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=342.84s)]
*  Senator John Kerry, who was [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=345.46s)]
*  running for president. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=347.6s)]
*  And I was one of the senior people on [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=348.6s)]
*  John Kerry's foreign policy team [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  during the campaign. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  When he runs for president, he asks [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=355.18s)]
*  you to join the team. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  But so does the Clinton campaign, the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=358.38s)]
*  Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  Were you torn between the two or was [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=361.82000000000005s)]
*  it clear in your mind that Obama was [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=364.06s)]
*  something fresh for America? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=365.92s)]
*  I had already committed to Obama, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=368.06s)]
*  but I realized in committing to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=370.94s)]
*  Obama, having been [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=372.98s)]
*  having served for eight years in the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=375.62s)]
*  Clinton administration, that I was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=377.0s)]
*  probably making a choice that was, in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=379.12s)]
*  all likelihood, not going to be [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  beneficial for my career, because most [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  people assume that as [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=385.54s)]
*  the betting money was on Senator [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  Clinton to be the nominee, Barack [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=389.6s)]
*  Obama seemed to many people like a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  long shot. And yet I made this choice [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=393.68s)]
*  very witting of that potential [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  consequence, because to me, Obama [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  represented something that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  went far beyond politics or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  even political affiliation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=407.32s)]
*  To me, most of all, I thought [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  that his election, if it could be [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=412.48s)]
*  accomplished, could [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=414.04s)]
*  be transformative and would speak [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=416.1s)]
*  volumes about our nation and its [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=417.92s)]
*  potential to grow and change. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  So when Obama gets elected, he asks [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=421.24s)]
*  you to become the ambassador to the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=423.56s)]
*  United Nations and ask Hillary Clinton, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  who you didn't work on her campaign, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=428.0s)]
*  to be secretary of state. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  And yet you form a pretty good bond [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=431.44s)]
*  with Secretary Clinton at that point. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  She is, as you know, a pure [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=435.98s)]
*  professional, and we were there [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  working in service of our country and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=441.06s)]
*  in service of the administration. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=443.38s)]
*  And I have to say, never once [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=445.38s)]
*  did I feel that she [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=447.58000000000004s)]
*  did anything other than provide [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=450.26s)]
*  me with the support [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=452.5s)]
*  that any teammate would provide to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=455.26s)]
*  another. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=457.54s)]
*  That whole thing leads to the toughest [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=458.26s)]
*  time in your career, which [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=461.06s)]
*  is Benghazi. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=463.22s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=464.78s)]
*  You lost a close friend in the Benghazi [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=465.55999999999995s)]
*  attack. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=468.11999999999995s)]
*  Well, Ambassador Chris Stevens and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=469.44s)]
*  then three other Americans. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=471.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  And it was not something you were [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=474.08s)]
*  particularly involved in. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=476.0s)]
*  But then on a Sunday, they [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=477.2s)]
*  want you to do the talk shows. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=479.52s)]
*  They want and they give you the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=482.28s)]
*  talking points about what happened in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  Benghazi. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=485.84s)]
*  What does your mother say when you [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  tell her you're going to go on the TV [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=488.28s)]
*  shows? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=489.64s)]
*  The moral of the story, Walters, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=492.52s)]
*  listen to your mother. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=494.28s)]
*  I went to check on my mom and she's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=495.97999999999996s)]
*  like, you know, I know you've had a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=497.78s)]
*  rough week. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=498.65999999999997s)]
*  Are you hanging in there? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=499.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=500.26s)]
*  What is your plan for the weekend? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=501.26s)]
*  And I said, well, on Sunday, I've [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=502.97999999999996s)]
*  been asked to go on all five Sunday [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=505.14s)]
*  shows to talk about what happened this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  week, which was not only Benghazi in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=509.02s)]
*  that tragedy, but you may remember [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=510.94s)]
*  that many of our embassies around [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=512.86s)]
*  the world had been attacked [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=514.86s)]
*  by violent protesters, not [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=516.98s)]
*  terrorists, but violent protesters. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=519.18s)]
*  So I explained to her that I was going [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=521.5799999999999s)]
*  on the shows and she said, what? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=523.04s)]
*  Why you? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=525.56s)]
*  Why not Secretary Clinton? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=528.4s)]
*  And I said, well, my understanding [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=530.36s)]
*  from the White House is she was asked [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  and she declined, I presume, because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=534.36s)]
*  she was exhausted after [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=536.68s)]
*  a long week and emotionally drained, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=538.72s)]
*  didn't want to do it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=540.48s)]
*  And, you know, I didn't want to do it, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=541.96s)]
*  but I agreed to do it because they [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=543.92s)]
*  asked me to. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=545.76s)]
*  And I understand that somebody needs [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=546.64s)]
*  to go out on these shows. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=548.76s)]
*  And, you know, I'll [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=550.36s)]
*  agree to do it because I'm a team [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  player. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=554.66s)]
*  And my mom said, I smell a rat. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=555.5799999999999s)]
*  You should not go on those shows. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=557.62s)]
*  Did she smell a rat, meaning that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=559.54s)]
*  Secretary Clinton was setting you up? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  I think she smelled various rats. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=566.02s)]
*  First one was the one [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=568.62s)]
*  that that that I put great [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=570.9s)]
*  a stock in in retrospect, which [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  is it in a politically charged [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  environment. This is the middle of the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=577.3s)]
*  2012 election campaign and [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=579.62s)]
*  something tragic like this happens. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=581.72s)]
*  And inevitably, you know, the information [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=583.3000000000001s)]
*  is going to turn out to be in some way, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  shape or form imperfect [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=587.0600000000001s)]

*  first is likely to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=591.78s)]
*  be targeted, not just the message, but [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=594.6600000000001s)]
*  the messenger. I think she intuitively understood [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=596.4200000000001s)]
*  that. I think she suspected [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=598.58s)]
*  that somehow [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  I was being thrust forward [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=603.38s)]
*  by Secretary Clinton [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=605.5400000000001s)]
*  and she was receding that I [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=607.58s)]
*  don't actually believe that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=609.7s)]
*  And my mother and I have had this argument [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=611.84s)]
*  because it was first of all, it was the White [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=614.84s)]
*  House that asked me to do it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  There's a White House who goes and asks [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=617.1400000000001s)]
*  principals if they'll appear on shows. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=618.84s)]
*  And I think Secretary Clinton may have just made [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=620.84s)]
*  a judgment in her own interest [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=622.88s)]
*  for whatever reason that she [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=625.32s)]
*  didn't want to do it. She didn't then say, but go [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=627.6400000000001s)]
*  get Susan to do it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  At least I have no reason to believe that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=632.0s)]
*  So I never felt like the version [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  of this story, which was, you know, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=636.5200000000001s)]
*  that some people claim that I was set up [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=638.74s)]
*  is fair. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=641.0600000000001s)]
*  But what I do think is interesting [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=642.1s)]
*  and what I've tried to learn [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=644.1800000000001s)]
*  is one of my lessons subsequently [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=646.38s)]
*  is that my instinct to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=649.38s)]
*  be a team player, to put mission first [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=651.5s)]
*  and not think about, could there be [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=653.94s)]
*  some consequences for me, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=655.98s)]
*  may be noble, but it can be self-defeating. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=658.14s)]
*  And [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=661.4200000000001s)]
*  in this case, it proved to be costly. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  So they gave you talking points, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=666.56s)]
*  the intelligence community that says, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=668.32s)]
*  here's what happened in Benghazi. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=670.4s)]
*  If I remember correctly, the talking points say [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=672.4s)]
*  that there were demonstrations, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=675.08s)]
*  demonstrations throughout the Middle East, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=676.52s)]
*  and it was opportunistic [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=677.68s)]
*  that then some extremists get involved [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=679.96s)]
*  in attacking. And that's what you say. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=682.8s)]
*  You follow the talking points. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=684.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=685.44s)]
*  And then, boom, what happens? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=686.72s)]
*  It was some days later [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=689.12s)]
*  when information began to surface [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=691.96s)]
*  that ran counter in certain respects [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=695.02s)]
*  to the information in those talking points, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=697.98s)]
*  which I said at the time when I went on the show, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=699.86s)]
*  is look, this is our best current information. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=702.02s)]
*  It could change. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=704.1s)]
*  There are going to be investigations [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=704.94s)]
*  by the FBI and others. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=705.9s)]
*  So I'm telling you today what we believe to be the case. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=706.9s)]
*  But all those caveats got dismissed. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=710.26s)]
*  So you put together a punching bag. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=713.62s)]
*  I mean, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=715.62s)]
*  all of them turn you into a punching bag saying [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=717.9s)]
*  that you were purposely misleading the American people, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=720.46s)]
*  that Benghazi was a terrorist attack [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=723.84s)]
*  and the Obama administration is trying to cover that up. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=726.0s)]
*  That was their line of attack against me. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=729.44s)]
*  Why did that happen? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=732.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a question for them. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=734.48s)]
*  I mean, my assumption at the time was, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=736.6800000000001s)]
*  which also may have turned out to be false, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=739.24s)]
*  that this was principally motivated [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=740.84s)]
*  by election year politics. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=743.6s)]
*  And here was an attack against one of our facilities [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=745.5200000000001s)]
*  that killed four Americans on our watch. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  And they wanted to use that to attack the president. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=751.4s)]
*  I think because I was perceived as being close [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=754.06s)]
*  to the president, because I was speaking [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=756.62s)]
*  on behalf of the administration, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=758.38s)]
*  and maybe for a variety of other reasons, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=760.62s)]
*  they fought me an attractive target. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  Was there something you should have done differently [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=764.42s)]
*  when you had those talking points? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=766.62s)]
*  No, I don't think there's anything [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=768.66s)]
*  I could have done differently. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=769.8199999999999s)]
*  What I did do and should have done [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=770.66s)]
*  was to compare those talking points, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=773.38s)]
*  this is publicly provided, publicly available information, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=776.1s)]
*  with what I knew to be the classified information. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=779.98s)]
*  And what does the classified information say? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=782.5s)]
*  The classified information tracked the talking points. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=783.7s)]
*  If they hadn't, I would have raised a red flag [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=786.46s)]
*  and said, wait a minute, why is there a disconnect? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=788.9000000000001s)]
*  So Lindsey Graham in particular becomes a point person. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=791.1s)]
*  You become a punching bag. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=794.86s)]
*  What's the phrase you use in the book? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=796.34s)]
*  Recyclable boogie man. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=798.38s)]
*  Right, that's a pretty good phrase. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=799.88s)]
*  But you're really tough on him. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=802.6600000000001s)]
*  I think you call him unctuous, snarky, other things. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  Was this personal? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=810.36s)]
*  I had no relationship with Lindsey Graham [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=812.0s)]
*  until he went on television and called me [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=814.28s)]
*  either incompetent or untrustworthy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=816.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think America has now seen a lot more of Lindsey Graham. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=820.9599999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm about to tell you. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=827.64s)]
*  In recent months in the Trump era [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=828.8399999999999s)]
*  than I think they understood before, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=831.56s)]
*  I think Lindsey Graham had a reputation [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=834.26s)]
*  for being a maverick akin to John McCain, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=836.16s)]
*  who I think genuinely was a maverick [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=841.12s)]
*  and somebody that I respect. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=843.28s)]
*  I think Lindsey Graham was seen as somebody who, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  as he did during the 2016 campaign, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=848.88s)]
*  told the American people how much trouble [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=851.92s)]
*  the United States would be in if they elected Donald Trump. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=853.9399999999999s)]
*  And now every day we see him apologizing for whitewashing [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=857.02s)]
*  sanitizing some of Trump's most concerning behaviors [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=864.66s)]
*  and decisions as if he were on Trump's paid staff [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=868.86s)]
*  rather than a senator in the United States Congress. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=874.66s)]
*  During that period, President Obama was considering [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=878.62s)]
*  tapping you to be secretary of state. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=882.38s)]
*  And at a certain point, you decide [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=885.08s)]
*  you just have to withdraw from consideration. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=887.34s)]
*  Tell me the effect that had on your son, Jake. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=889.74s)]
*  Jake at that point was 15. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=891.94s)]
*  And all through the Benghazi thing, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=895.1s)]
*  he'd been quite stoical, like not reacting [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=897.22s)]
*  the way his sister was, not particularly emotional about it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=901.34s)]
*  And I sat him down, I said, Jake, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=905.6s)]
*  I thought long and hard about this [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=907.98s)]
*  and I've decided to take my name out of consideration [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=909.62s)]
*  for secretary of state. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=912.6600000000001s)]
*  And he shocked me by bursting into tears [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=914.86s)]
*  and saying, mommy, you can't quit. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=918.62s)]
*  You can't quit. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=920.74s)]
*  You've taught me all your life, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=921.58s)]
*  all my life never to be a quitter. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=923.74s)]
*  How can you do this? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=925.6600000000001s)]
*  And I was, I didn't really, I didn't expect that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=928.0200000000001s)]
*  I didn't know how to react to that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=931.7s)]
*  And I held him and I said, Jake, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=934.0600000000001s)]
*  I know I've taught you never to be a quitter [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=936.98s)]
*  and I'm not quitting. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=939.0200000000001s)]
*  I'm making a decision that's for the family, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=940.46s)]
*  that's for the country, that's for the president's agenda. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=943.0200000000001s)]
*  And he's like, he's arguing with me. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=946.6600000000001s)]
*  He's like, the family's gonna be okay. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=947.94s)]
*  We've been through the worst. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=949.46s)]
*  I said, Jake, sometimes it's not about you. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=951.56s)]
*  You gotta put a larger interest ahead of yourself. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=954.28s)]
*  And I made this decision, honey, and I'm confident in it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=959.04s)]
*  And I love that he loved me so much [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=966.0s)]
*  that it mattered that much to him. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=970.2399999999999s)]
*  But I hope now that he's seven years older, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=971.76s)]
*  that he understands the logic of that better. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=975.7399999999999s)]
*  He went to Stanford in your footsteps, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=979.64s)]
*  but he's become a conservative activist. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=982.12s)]
*  What's that like dealing with that in your family? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=984.76s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=988.08s)]
*  I mean, there are lots of issues we disagree on. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=989.52s)]
*  There are some things we agree on [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=991.58s)]
*  and we can find common ground, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=993.08s)]
*  but we have robust arguments. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=994.16s)]
*  But I love my kids more than anything. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=997.04s)]
*  And Jake and his differing political perspectives [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1000.4s)]
*  have taught me something really important, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1004.96s)]
*  which is that, first of all, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1007.4s)]
*  beyond any policy or political differences, we're a family. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1010.64s)]
*  We love each other. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1014.24s)]
*  We're not willing to let these things tear us apart, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1015.0799999999999s)]
*  which doesn't mean it's easy. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1018.26s)]
*  Doesn't mean we don't argue on occasion. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1020.06s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  we are committed to hanging together as a family. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1024.68s)]
*  Is that a metaphor for our country that we could use? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1028.04s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1029.76s)]
*  And I try to explain, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1030.6s)]
*  you can't understand somebody that you don't see. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1033.62s)]
*  You can't know somebody that you won't listen to. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1038.16s)]
*  And increasingly in this country, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1043.72s)]
*  we sort of live in our own little cocoons. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1045.18s)]
*  My son, Jake, brings home to me on a regular basis [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1048.1200000000001s)]
*  an understanding and a perspective [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1052.76s)]
*  of how many people in this country think. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1054.2s)]
*  When, as national security advisor, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1056.5600000000002s)]
*  did you learn about Russian interference [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1059.38s)]
*  in the 2016 elections? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1061.96s)]
*  Early August of 2016. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1064.12s)]
*  Should you have said something much more loudly [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1067.76s)]
*  as an administration? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1069.76s)]
*  I think we said something loudly on October 7th [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1071.6s)]
*  when the director of national intelligence [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1075.36s)]
*  and the Homeland Security Secretary [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1078.4799999999998s)]
*  issued an unprecedented statement, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1080.52s)]
*  which said very plainly to the American people, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1082.84s)]
*  Russian government at the highest levels [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  is actively involved in trying to interfere [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1090.44s)]
*  in our elections. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1094.72s)]
*  But what people don't remember, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1095.8s)]
*  and the reason why the perception is [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1097.0s)]
*  that we didn't say something clearly enough [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1099.48s)]
*  or forcefully enough, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1101.72s)]
*  is that within a couple hours [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1103.0800000000002s)]
*  after the United States administration [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1105.1200000000001s)]
*  issued that statement, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  the Access Hollywood tape was released. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1109.24s)]
*  The one with President Trump talking about [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1111.8s)]
*  grabbing them by the you know what. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1115.0s)]
*  That overwhelmed the news cycle [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1117.68s)]
*  and then a few hours after that, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1121.2s)]
*  WikiLeaks dumped John Podesta's emails. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  And so what should have been front page, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1125.6s)]
*  top of the news hour, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1128.52s)]
*  blaring news about Russian interference [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1130.72s)]
*  became the third story of the day. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1133.6s)]
*  But still, was there more you should have done, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1135.84s)]
*  more you should have said during that period [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1138.6s)]
*  of October and early November [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1141.24s)]
*  about Russian interference in the election? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1143.08s)]
*  My judgment is that we were right to put together [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1144.96s)]
*  and put out the statement we did [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1150.32s)]
*  and to reiterate it as we did in public. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1151.48s)]
*  We were right to focus on trying to secure [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1155.08s)]
*  the, or trying to help the states secure [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1158.36s)]
*  their electoral system so they couldn't be manipulated. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1160.8s)]
*  We had prepared punitive options to use [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  if we thought that before the election [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1166.6799999999998s)]
*  that would be useful. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1168.52s)]
*  Where I think we made a mistake [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1169.72s)]
*  or with the benefit of hindsight, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1172.56s)]
*  I wish we'd done something differently, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1174.76s)]
*  was in two respects. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1177.12s)]
*  One was when we ultimately employed [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1180.12s)]
*  very tough sanctions in December against Russia, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1183.1599999999999s)]
*  penalizing them for what they did, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1185.8799999999999s)]
*  we did not go quite as far as we could have. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1189.28s)]
*  We didn't take the kinds of punitive measures [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1192.56s)]
*  that would have cut off whole sectors [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1195.8s)]
*  of the Russian economy. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1197.36s)]
*  Because, primarily because we thought [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1199.52s)]
*  that that would boomerang back on our European allies, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  the nature of the tools we had were not discriminant. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1204.4799999999998s)]
*  And because we were also trying to keep [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1208.4s)]
*  the Europeans on board with the sanctions [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1211.04s)]
*  that we had collectively imposed regarding Ukraine. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1212.92s)]
*  And also, to complicate things, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1216.68s)]
*  we had a president-elect who was already indicating [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1220.84s)]
*  that he was gonna take a different approach to Russia [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1224.68s)]
*  and that he was much more forgiving of this interference. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1227.28s)]
*  And so we were looking out over the horizon [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1230.84s)]
*  three, four, five weeks and wondering [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1233.28s)]
*  if we put the toughest possible sanctions on, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1234.96s)]
*  would he turn around two days after the inauguration [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1237.52s)]
*  and undo them. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1240.96s)]
*  One of the most astonishing scenes in the book [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1241.8s)]
*  is this meeting at the very end [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1244.0s)]
*  when Obama is about to leave office, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1245.48s)]
*  Trump is about to come in, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1247.6s)]
*  where Obama asks, what should we be able to share [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1249.08s)]
*  with the incoming Trump administration? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1253.68s)]
*  Are there any limitations on what we should share? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1255.76s)]
*  Because, frankly, his instruction, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1257.52s)]
*  the president's instruction to us from way back [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1260.92s)]
*  was be as forthcoming as you possibly can. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1263.52s)]
*  Because President Obama believed critically [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1266.28s)]
*  in the importance of one administration, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1270.08s)]
*  regardless of party, doing a smooth handoff, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1272.68s)]
*  just as President George W. Bush had done for him, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1276.08s)]
*  which he was always grateful for. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  But on the particular issue of Russia, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1281.36s)]
*  given some of the president's public, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1286.28s)]
*  President Trump's public statements, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1289.04s)]
*  given some of National Security Advisor [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1290.92s)]
*  to designate Flynn's statements and actions, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1294.28s)]
*  and given stuff that we were seeing in other channels, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1297.56s)]
*  there was a question in his mind [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1302.72s)]
*  about whether there was any reason we should be careful [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1304.84s)]
*  about the extent to which we communicate [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1309.6399999999999s)]
*  our understanding of what's up with Russia. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1312.96s)]
*  And did you hold back on communicating? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1315.2s)]
*  I'm not gonna go there. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1317.96s)]
*  I don't wanna get into classified information. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1321.48s)]
*  When you look at the allegations against President Trump [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1325.2s)]
*  of trying to use Ukraine, and now even China, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1328.92s)]
*  calling on them to do investigations of Biden [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1332.6s)]
*  from a national security perspective, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1335.8s)]
*  how dangerous do you think that is? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1339.08s)]
*  It's extremely dangerous. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1340.76s)]
*  In the case of Ukraine, it was withholding [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1341.96s)]
*  a presidential meeting and withholding military assistance, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1346.6s)]
*  $400 million in military assistance, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1350.56s)]
*  that is occupied by Russia, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1352.96s)]
*  that is in a hot shooting war [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1355.24s)]
*  as we speak with Russia, our adversary, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1356.8000000000002s)]
*  in order to get alleged dirt on his political opponent. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1360.0s)]
*  That's mind-boggling enough. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1366.24s)]
*  China, the same thing, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1369.04s)]
*  make up some dirt on Biden and give it to me. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1373.28s)]
*  And he says that right after he explains [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1376.44s)]
*  that he has all this leverage to use [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1380.52s)]
*  in the trade war with China. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1383.04s)]
*  The clear implication of that for Beijing [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1384.96s)]
*  is if you make up some dirt on Biden [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1389.84s)]
*  and manufacture some falsehoods and give it to me, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1392.16s)]
*  maybe some of our problems in the trade sphere [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1396.64s)]
*  or the security sphere or with respect to Huawei [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1398.96s)]
*  can be resolved in a fashion [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1401.68s)]
*  that you'll be satisfied with Beijing. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1403.72s)]
*  So Walter, what that means is [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  the President of the United States [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1408.4s)]
*  is selling out our farmers, our manufacturers, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1410.52s)]
*  all of the American people who've paid mightily [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1413.88s)]
*  for Trump's trade war in order to get dirt [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1416.68s)]
*  on his political opponent. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1419.2800000000002s)]
*  If that's not a corruption of national security [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1420.48s)]
*  and a danger and an abuse of office, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1424.68s)]
*  honest to God, I don't know what is. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1428.3200000000002s)]
*  What is the overall effect on America's status in the world? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1430.3200000000002s)]
*  We have a President of the United States [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1435.0s)]
*  who's plainly and clearly acting only [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1437.6s)]
*  in his personal political interest. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  Who's gonna wanna join us the next time we call? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1444.7199999999998s)]
*  Whether it's to deal with an Ebola epidemic [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1449.4399999999998s)]
*  or to sanction the Russians over Ukraine, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1453.12s)]
*  or even as we recently saw, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1456.32s)]
*  to join us in patrolling in the Persian Gulf [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1458.36s)]
*  because we're worried about Iran. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1460.6799999999998s)]
*  The people aren't answering the call. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1463.9199999999998s)]
*  And I don't know if I'm prepared to say [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1468.48s)]
*  that the damage is irreparable, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1473.1599999999999s)]
*  but I think if we have to endure [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1476.28s)]
*  and the world has to endure, frankly, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1478.8799999999999s)]
*  another five and a half years of this, it probably will be. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1481.56s)]
*  Ambassador Rice, thanks for being with us. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1489.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecNDGa7DDmo&t=1490.1999999999998s)]
