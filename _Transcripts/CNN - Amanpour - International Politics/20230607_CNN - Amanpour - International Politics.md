# Haiti on the Brink “The Entire Country Is in Agony,” Says Renowned Doctor  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [June 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o)
*  Well, now turning to Haiti, a nation reeling from yesterday's deadly earthquake that killed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=0.0s)]
*  at least four people just after the devastating floods which left thousands homeless and over [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=4.44s)]
*  40 dead. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=9.72s)]
*  These disasters only add to the suffering in a country already plagued by gang violence [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=10.96s)]
*  and government instability. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=15.36s)]
*  Our next guest, Dr. Jean-Pap, says without international help, the country could descend [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=17.56s)]
*  into a civil war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=22.44s)]
*  And here he is speaking with Michelle Martin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=24.12s)]
*  Thanks, Bianna. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Jean-Pap, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=28.2s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  We have a number of things to talk with you about, but how are things now? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=32.32s)]
*  I mean, I understand that there was very serious flooding just within the last couple of days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=35.4s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  How are things? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, we're okay. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  You know, June 1st starts the hurricane season, and Haiti is one of the most fragile countries [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  in the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=52.08s)]
*  So on June 1st, we had the very, very bad weather that led to flooding where we are, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=54.76s)]
*  including in my own office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=63.16s)]
*  But the country suffered the most. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=66.52s)]
*  We have 42 deaths, unfortunately, and 11 people have disappeared. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=68.6s)]
*  We have not seen any sign of them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  And 10,000 people were homeless. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  We also had an earthquake yesterday in the south of the country that killed four people. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=80.72s)]
*  So that's the situation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  The country is very fragile. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=89.84s)]
*  For people who have ever been to Haiti, who have done work there, who have visited, they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=91.56s)]
*  are well aware that your clinic, Giscu, has never shut down before. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Are you able to treat people at the moment? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=103.24s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=105.2s)]
*  Since yesterday, we were fully operational, because we worked this past Sunday to clean [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=106.2s)]
*  the place. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=111.84s)]
*  And, thanks God, we are completely operational. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=112.84s)]
*  That's good to hear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=116.48s)]
*  Well, you wrote a very powerful and, frankly, very alarming piece for The New York Times, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=118.04s)]
*  a guest essay, saying that things are really dire. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=124.48s)]
*  And you said this is the first time you really feel that Haiti needs outside help. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=129.36s)]
*  Why did you say that? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=134.36s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=135.52s)]
*  Well, this is correct. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=136.52s)]
*  As you know, we've lived through political instability. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=138.56s)]
*  Twenty-three governments since 1986. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=142.0s)]
*  We lived through major hurricanes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=145.56s)]
*  We had two major earthquakes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=150.76000000000002s)]
*  2010, in particular, was devastating. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=153.16000000000003s)]
*  But what's particularly hard now is that we have a perfect storm. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  We had a president who was elected, but this president had an opposition even before he [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=164.72s)]
*  got into power. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=175.44s)]
*  With the country being locked, that is closed for three months by the opposition at the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=177.56s)]
*  time, where schools, even in a country where 50 percent of people are illiterate, schools [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=183.2s)]
*  were forced to close, businesses closed, etc. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  So this was very, very damaging to the country that culminated with the assassination of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=192.68s)]
*  the president this past July 2021. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  And since that time, we have no elected person in government. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  So this is the political part. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, if you look at the economy, for the last four years, the economy has been negative. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  It's like the economy of a country at war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  We are not at war with any country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=222.44s)]
*  We are at war with ourselves. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=224.88s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  And the inflation is 47 percent. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=228.6s)]
*  The local currency has been devaluated 50 percent in the last three years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=232.52s)]
*  Now with this situation, we have a huge humanitarian crisis because the price of food has increased [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=240.24s)]
*  a lot, but something new happened. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=246.68s)]
*  And this is perhaps the most severe. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=249.84s)]
*  The fact that gangs have taken control of the entry to the capital, both south and north. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=251.84s)]
*  And because of that, you have crops being produced by the peasants in your countryside [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=258.88s)]
*  that are being rotten because they cannot bring them to the capital. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=264.2s)]
*  So that has also increased the price of food. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=268.46s)]
*  And as a result, we have over 50 percent of people living in food insecurity. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  In our own centers, we are seeing more and more children with more severe dehydration [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=278.56s)]
*  and severe malnutrition. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=284.2s)]
*  With severe malnutrition, it's associated with all kinds of infectious diseases. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=287.04s)]
*  So this is horrible. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=292.08s)]
*  This is something that we don't want. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=293.36s)]
*  Talk to me about the gangs. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=295.64s)]
*  Is there any leadership among them? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=299.0s)]
*  Surely, some of their own members of these gangs are also experiencing these conditions. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=301.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm not an expert on gangs. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=306.44s)]
*  I don't work with gangs and I've not studied gangs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=308.64s)]
*  But what I've seen basically is the fact that they have evolved essentially in a vacuum. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Because when we were occupied by the UN forces from 2004 to 2017, 14 years, the country was [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=320.36s)]
*  very stable because at one point they had a force of 9000 people, mostly military people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=332.08s)]
*  with very well equipped with tanks, etc. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=337.44s)]
*  The country was very stable. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=340.16s)]
*  There was nothing going on. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=342.04s)]
*  But unfortunately, they didn't train their replacement. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=344.04s)]
*  For some reason, the US decided to deactivate the Haitian army. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=350.28s)]
*  And the Haitian army is the one that was in charge previously of doing everything. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=356.56s)]
*  They created the United States and army. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  And then they created France, the US and Canada created this new police force. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  At one point, they were strong of 13000, which was still much too little for a country of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=371.76s)]
*  over 11 million. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  But now, at most, they are 4000 fighting gangs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  But they were never trained to do that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=384.32s)]
*  They don't even have one tank. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=386.36s)]
*  We don't have one tank in our country. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=388.24s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=389.88s)]
*  And they struggle to get those vehicles that they are using now and that the gangs are [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=391.44s)]
*  actually burning with monocle cocktails. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=397.68s)]
*  So they are not as equipped as the gangs. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=403.32s)]
*  And at the same time, there was an embargo for the Haitian government to purchase guns [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=407.04s)]
*  by the US. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=412.96s)]
*  Well, actually, 90% of the gangs, that's what's being reported, the guns are coming from the US. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=415.48s)]
*  So this is kind of absurd. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=422.92s)]
*  So basically, there was never a large program for the youths, was mostly unemployed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=425.24s)]
*  So gang attraction became something very, very interesting, because they were paid also. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=432.88s)]
*  They were paid by the gangs to join them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=441.64s)]
*  And the gangs were making a lot of money. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=444.96s)]
*  They kidnapped the poorest to the richest. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=447.8s)]
*  What is day-to-day life like for you and for the people who work with you? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=451.64s)]
*  Can you just sort of describe what it takes to get through the day? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, we are resilient. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=459.88s)]
*  We are motivated. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=464.56s)]
*  We are optimist. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=466.18s)]
*  So we wake up in the morning with the idea that we could be kidnapped or killed. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=468.0s)]
*  But we come in in a convoy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=473.52s)]
*  We also live in a convoy, because we feel we are stronger when we are together. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=475.72s)]
*  But when we are here, you may, during our interview here, some gunfire, because it's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=480.48s)]
*  usually unusual when you don't hear them. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=486.36s)]
*  They are all around us. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=489.12s)]
*  It's been difficult, because we had, on four occasions, members of our staff kidnapped. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=492.32s)]
*  The pressure we put on the gangs is that we close the centers. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=501.08s)]
*  When we close the center, from where I'm talking to you now, it's in downtown Port-au-Prince, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=506.8s)]
*  that has been abandoned by the US, by friends. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=513.04s)]
*  Nobody stays downtown, because it has never been rebuilt, was destroyed by the earthquake. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=516.6s)]
*  But we are close to the poor people, and they ask us to stay, and we stay with them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=523.84s)]
*  When we close here, it's a disaster, because we receive, on a daily basis, 2,000 people [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=528.84s)]
*  who get free care. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=535.72s)]
*  2,000 people a day? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=536.72s)]
*  Yes, who get free care. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=539.72s)]
*  The street merchants don't even come when we close. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=542.8s)]
*  So the gangs release our staff without a ransom. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=547.56s)]
*  We never pay the ransom. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  But it's still a huge traumatic experience, even if you're kidnapped for an hour or a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=553.28s)]
*  minute, because it's your freedom that's taken off from you. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  We've heard of these really gruesome attacks on what police remain. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=567.48s)]
*  And have members of your staff left the country just because it's just too much? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  It's just more than they can tolerate? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=578.32s)]
*  It's not just members of our staff. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=579.88s)]
*  There is a huge exodus, the largest ever, because of insecurity. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=583.2s)]
*  The majority of them are left for the US or Canada, Canada mostly. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=590.2s)]
*  But now, with the opening through the Biden offering, we have more people leaving, including [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=595.76s)]
*  policemen. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=602.72s)]
*  Now, to understand, we have a staff of 600. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=603.72s)]
*  We lost 200 of the best and brightest. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=607.24s)]
*  So this is the situation we're in now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=611.12s)]
*  If this continues, would you say that it is likely you will have to shut down, that you [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=614.72s)]
*  cannot continue under these circumstances? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=619.8s)]
*  Is that a realistic possibility? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=621.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=624.12s)]
*  If this continues, we'll have to shut down the downtown center, because where we are, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=625.12s)]
*  it's the most dangerous part. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=630.92s)]
*  Nobody wants to come down here. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=632.52s)]
*  And for about 20 years, it's been called the red zone. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=634.8399999999999s)]
*  If you were to close down there, what do you think the result would be? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=639.68s)]
*  Well, you know, it would have three impacts, because our mission is one of patient care [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=645.0s)]
*  We are the largest center for HIV and tuberculosis in the Americas, one of the largest. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=654.84s)]
*  So that would suffer a lot. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=662.2s)]
*  And we also have a large center for cardiovascular disease, because this has become now the number [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=664.2s)]
*  one killer in it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=670.2s)]
*  So we open a center for that. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=671.96s)]
*  And it's really at the downtown site where I am right now. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=674.2800000000001s)]
*  In terms of training, we are the largest postgraduate training center in Haiti. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=679.24s)]
*  We also have the first master of public health program in this practitioner program with [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=686.12s)]
*  KISCA University and also a large community health program. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=693.0s)]
*  And then for research, we've published over 300 papers, and some of them have changed [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=699.64s)]
*  guidelines for WHO on HIV, tuberculosis, cholera, and now cardiovascular disease. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  So this is the impact that it would have. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=717.6400000000001s)]
*  One of the things you were telling us earlier is that the gangs have controlled, at least [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=720.6s)]
*  at a certain point, they controlled access not just to major, of entire neighborhoods, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=724.84s)]
*  but of access to the fuel depot and access to the airport. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=731.72s)]
*  So how are you even getting your supplies at this point? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=735.48s)]
*  For most, it's not a huge problem. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=739.16s)]
*  The gangs, in fact, they had kidnapped a container that contained two extra machines that were [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=741.88s)]
*  going to be delivered to our site. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=749.88s)]
*  When they learned that it was for us, they let it go. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=752.12s)]
*  So I cannot complain about that for the downtown center, but for the rest of the country, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=756.04s)]
*  it's terrible for a business person [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=762.04s)]
*  to have a container leaving customs. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=765.0799999999999s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=768.6s)]
*  So the country, the entire country is in agony. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=770.36s)]
*  I don't know how long we can sustain this. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=773.0s)]
*  You've said in your piece that you have never before called for international intervention, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  and you also made the point that, you know, no country would want that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=781.24s)]
*  No country wants foreign soldiers on their soil, but at this point, you feel that there is no other [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=784.76s)]
*  choice. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=794.12s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=794.8399999999999s)]
*  What do you think would help the most at this point? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=795.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, honestly, what we need, we need a support to the national police, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=799.8s)]
*  because they are fighting alone. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=804.92s)]
*  They don't have the proper guns. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=807.7199999999999s)]
*  They don't have the numbers, but the population is helping them, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=810.36s)]
*  because I think that the population alone has been now so desperate [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=815.0s)]
*  that they are ready to defend themselves with whatever they have. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=821.96s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's not a solution either, because innocent people could also perish in this. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=827.08s)]
*  But the reality is that they've been so abandoned by the international community, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=833.08s)]
*  and the government cannot protect them, that now they have formed brigades in many neighborhoods [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=836.9200000000001s)]
*  where they are defending themselves to make sure that they are not the victims of gangs anymore. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=845.24s)]
*  But this will not solve the issue. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=851.8s)]
*  We need to bring back law and order with injustice. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=854.76s)]
*  Do you have a message for particularly people in the United States and perhaps Canada or perhaps [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=858.84s)]
*  France who may be listening to this conversation and might be wondering what they can do to support [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=865.4s)]
*  you and your colleagues and anyone who wishes to see stability and, frankly, humanity returned [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=872.36s)]
*  to Haiti, because as you pointed out, no one wants to live like this. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=880.84s)]
*  Yes, I think that an unstable Haiti is not good for anybody. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=884.44s)]
*  It's not good for a neighborhood or Dominican Republic. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=890.52s)]
*  It's not good for the region. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=892.84s)]
*  It's not good for the United States. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=893.88s)]
*  I think that France, we have strong ties with France. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=896.6s)]
*  I think they can also help. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  I understand that there are some French and American [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=903.0s)]
*  trainers who come in Haiti to train the national police. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=908.36s)]
*  We need a little more than that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=913.0s)]
*  We need people on the ground that can direct operations. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=915.16s)]
*  And we also need some support to invest in the youth. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=919.0s)]
*  It's not normal that the youth has no future, that the only thing that they can think of is [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=924.36s)]
*  leaving the country. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=929.4s)]
*  It's not good for anybody. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=930.84s)]
*  And I think that they are amazing because what we do, we offer them training ourselves [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=932.68s)]
*  in our vocational school, and it's amazing to see what they can do. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=941.16s)]
*  We also have a school here on the premises from where I'm talking to you. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=945.24s)]
*  And you should see how kids are eager to learn. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=951.0799999999999s)]
*  So we need to change the dynamic. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=955.1600000000001s)]
*  For once, give Haiti a good chance. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=960.12s)]
*  We never had that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=963.32s)]
*  Before we let you go, and I don't want to offend with this question, but I do think there are [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=964.5200000000001s)]
*  those who will be listening to our conversation who might wonder, with your training, your [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=969.32s)]
*  international relationships and the respect that you have around the world, I think there are those [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=975.1600000000001s)]
*  who wonder why you stay. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=980.5200000000001s)]
*  Why do you stay? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=982.12s)]
*  You know, I built with my colleagues a center. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=984.76s)]
*  It's unique in many ways. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=991.24s)]
*  I'm an infectious disease person. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=993.72s)]
*  That's my specialty. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=995.96s)]
*  But we have also set up a cardiovascular center because this is the number one killer in the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=997.8000000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1003.72s)]
*  Here we are making a difference. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1004.76s)]
*  We've seen AIDS being the number one cause of death for three decades, not the seventh [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1007.24s)]
*  cause of death. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1013.96s)]
*  Cardiovascular disease is the new challenge, and we're tackling that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1015.5600000000001s)]
*  And at the same time, when things are desperate, we are operational. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1021.0s)]
*  We are going to present our results, the results of a cohort of 3,000 people that we followed [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1026.2s)]
*  for five years. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1032.2s)]
*  We are going to follow them for 10 years. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1033.0s)]
*  So at the same time, the country is not working. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  We are fully functional. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1041.08s)]
*  So essentially, it would be a shame to leave all that we've built. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1044.04s)]
*  And I think it would be a waste for the country. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1051.96s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1055.56s)]
*  It's my legacy to my country. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1056.92s)]
*  Dr. Jean-Paul, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1064.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSv8sORqI3o&t=1073.96s)]
