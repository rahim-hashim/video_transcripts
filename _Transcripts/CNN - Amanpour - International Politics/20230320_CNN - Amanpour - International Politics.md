# Did Pres. Bush’s Invasion of Iraq Pave the Way for Trump’s Presidency?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo)
*  And next to the United States, where the consequences of the Iraq War are also still being felt, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Bush has never admitted that his war was a mistake, unlike some of his officials [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=6.0s)]
*  and many Republicans today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=9.88s)]
*  Our next guest, Professor Melvin Loeffler, tackles the question of responsibility and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=12.08s)]
*  accountability in his new book, Confronting Saddam Hussein, George W. Bush, and the Invasion [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=16.52s)]
*  of Iraq. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  And here he is now with Walter Isaacson. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Christiane and Professor Mel Loeffler. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=26.48s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=29.32s)]
*  Delighted to be with you, Walter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=30.32s)]
*  Today marks the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=33.92s)]
*  And you write that that was the most consequential American foreign policy act of the 21st century. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=39.56s)]
*  What were the consequences? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=46.16s)]
*  There were many. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=48.56s)]
*  First off, keep in mind that it led to the deaths of over 200,000 Iraqis and the displacement [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=49.96s)]
*  of about nine million Iraqis. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  It led to the deaths of approximately 9,000 American soldiers and private contractors. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=64.08s)]
*  It will cost the American people over time approximately $2 trillion. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=74.36s)]
*  Geopolitically, it had significant consequences as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  It diverted American attention from the ongoing war in Afghanistan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=87.8s)]
*  It allowed Iran to become predominant in the Persian Gulf. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  It divided America from its European allies, however briefly. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=101.26s)]
*  It distracted America's attention from the rise of China and from the revanchism in Russia. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=105.94s)]
*  So geopolitically, it had significant consequences as well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=113.94s)]
*  But didn't we think that Saddam Hussein was a really bad threat and that we had to do [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=118.42s)]
*  this? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=123.66000000000001s)]
*  I mean, weren't these well-intentioned decisions? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  Yes, they were well-intentioned decisions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  As I describe in my book, Saddam Hussein was a brutal, cruel dictator who had developed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=131.22s)]
*  weapons of mass destruction, who had used weapons of mass destruction, meaning chemical [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=139.10000000000002s)]
*  and biological weapons, both against his own people and against the Iranians in the Iraq-Iranian [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=145.3s)]
*  war. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=151.78s)]
*  He had lied about his weapons of mass destruction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=152.78s)]
*  He had concealed his weapons of mass destruction. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  And he was overall a character who could not at all be trusted. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=160.78s)]
*  So I think what I try to present in my book is that there were good reasons for American [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=166.06s)]
*  policymakers to be extremely distrustful and suspicious of him, especially after the shock [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=174.5s)]
*  of 9-11. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=183.78s)]
*  That doesn't mean that I'm writing that the war was justified, but it does mean that policymakers [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=186.14s)]
*  were acting, in your words, out of good intentions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  They certainly wanted to prevent the United States from suffering another attack like [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=200.17999999999998s)]
*  the one that had happened on 9-11. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=205.98s)]
*  I want to drill down on the question of why did George W. Bush do this? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  Why did he invade? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  And there are many theories weaving through your book and other places, some of which [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  had to do with his father and the way his father conducted the first Gulf War. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=219.82s)]
*  Some say it was Cheney and Wolfowitz and advisers like that who drove him into it and had undue [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=225.82s)]
*  influence on him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  Some say it was a whole fog and confusion. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  Some say he really did believe in democracy promotion and that he would create democracy [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=238.14s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=244.18s)]
*  What do you think the motivations really were? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=245.18s)]
*  I think the overriding motivation was fear and a sense of responsibility to prevent another [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=259.3s)]
*  The allegations that he was trying to redress the errors of his father or get even with [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=261.7s)]
*  Saddam Hussein for Hussein's effort to assassinate his father, there seems to be no credible [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=269.94s)]
*  evidence to suggest that those were real factors. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=276.62s)]
*  But President Bush clearly was extraordinarily worried about another attack and he had reason [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=282.94s)]
*  to be worried about it based on incontrovertible evidence that Al Qaeda did seek to attack [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=293.58000000000004s)]
*  the United States again. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=301.66s)]
*  The notions that Dick Cheney was making policy or the neocons like Paul Wolfowitz and Doug [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=303.5s)]
*  Fythe, those generalizations are simply not well founded if you look carefully at the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=309.1s)]
*  evidence. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=316.82s)]
*  And the evidence suggests that President Bush was motivated principally by fear and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=317.9s)]
*  President Bush also believed he had the capacity, the capabilities, the power to deal with this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=325.62s)]
*  perception of threat. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  So it's really fear, power, hubris that motivated him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  In your book there's a scene that illustrates I think one of the failings that happened [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  in U.S. policy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=350.38s)]
*  I'd like to describe that scene and have you discuss it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=351.38s)]
*  It's in a meeting with General Franks and you talk about President George W. Bush saying, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  can we win? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=360.78s)]
*  And General Franks says, yes sir. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=361.85999999999996s)]
*  And the president says, can we get rid of Saddam Hussein? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes sir, says the general. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=367.02s)]
*  And then you say the president did not ask what then. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=369.26s)]
*  Why was that the problem? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=374.58s)]
*  That was a tremendous problem because there was inadequate attention paid to what the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=376.58s)]
*  war plan is defined as phase four of the war effort. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=384.78s)]
*  Phase four was the post-war stabilization and reconstruction time period. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=390.5s)]
*  And President Bush and General Franks and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and other top [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=397.58000000000004s)]
*  officials actually spent a lot of time talking about the initial phases of the war plan. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  What would be required to topple Saddam Hussein. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=411.38s)]
*  But they did not spend much time on what it would take to preserve order and stability [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=415.66s)]
*  and ensure security in the aftermath of the government being toppled. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=423.14s)]
*  Hence, there was enormous confusion and there was enormous chaos and there was enormous [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=428.73999999999995s)]
*  disorder immediately after the regime was toppled. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=437.62s)]
*  And the United States did not have sufficient troops or sufficient plans to really deal [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=442.09999999999997s)]
*  with the dynamics of the situation that quickly emerged. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=449.78s)]
*  The administration must be held responsible for the inadequate planning for so-called [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  phase four, the post-war stabilization. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=459.53999999999996s)]
*  You say a hubris, but isn't that why we have an intelligence community? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  Why did not the CIA know what would happen in the aftermath of the war? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=466.74s)]
*  Well it's one because Walter, that's a very difficult thing to do. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=471.94s)]
*  Predicting the future is infused with imponderables. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=476.78s)]
*  So I mean one might say that what happened after the war might have been very different [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=483.34s)]
*  if the United States had sufficient forces to preserve order immediately. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=489.02s)]
*  But it is the role of the intelligence community to try to predict what would happen. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=495.17999999999995s)]
*  And in fact, in January of 2003, there were two intelligence analyses that broadly, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=501.42s)]
*  in broad strokes, didn't predict that there would be the type of chaos that emerged, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  but suggested that that was a possibility. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=519.74s)]
*  The top policymakers did not really pay enough attention, as I just said, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=526.22s)]
*  to what was likely to happen. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=532.78s)]
*  They did not pay attention to those two intelligence reports that emerged in January of 2003. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  One of the points that I want to emphasize is that the policymakers, for example, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=544.22s)]
*  in the State Department, General Powell, who is Secretary of State, some of his subordinates [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=552.38s)]
*  in the policy planning staff, like Richard Haas in the Division of Near Eastern Affairs, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=558.78s)]
*  like Bill Burns, these people were very skeptical of going into Iraq with combat troops, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=565.26s)]
*  very skeptical, but they never presented a systematic analysis of what was likely to happen. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=575.58s)]
*  WALTER ISAACSON, Former U.S. Secretary of State, Department of State of the United States [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=584.14s)]
*  Let me read you a sentence that you wrote, which is, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=584.5400000000001s)]
*  It's important to get the story right in order to grapple earnestly with the dilemmas of statecraft. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=587.6600000000001s)]
*  By simplifying the story, we comfort ourselves to think, if we only had more honest officials, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=595.26s)]
*  a stronger leader, a wiser policymaker, all would be well. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=601.26s)]
*  Why was it not true that, if they had just been a little bit wiser, things would have been well? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=606.78s)]
*  WALTER ISAACSON, Former U.S. Secretary of State, Department of State of the United States [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=611.98s)]
*  Well, it's because being wise is difficult. And what I try to show in this book and in many other [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=613.18s)]
*  books I have written is that decision-making is tough. There are real lessons to be extrapolated [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  from this decision to go to war. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=629.42s)]
*  One, American policymakers need to be able to calculate threats more carefully. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=634.06s)]
*  Americans need to modulate their fears. They need to really be able to determine much more [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=644.06s)]
*  accurately when there is or is not, quote, unquote, an existential threat. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=651.9s)]
*  They also need to grasp the limits of American power. During this period of time, of course, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=658.78s)]
*  the United States had hegemonic power, no great power rivals whatsoever. So, American policymakers [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=664.54s)]
*  thought they could achieve what they wanted to achieve. They have perceived threats [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=673.3399999999999s)]
*  and from a pretty weak nation overall, Iraq. And they believe that the exercise of their power [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=679.5s)]
*  would enable them relatively easily to remove the threat that they perceived. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=688.7s)]
*  Another lesson, right, would be reexamine fundamental assumptions. That's easy for me to say. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=695.1s)]
*  It's easy for most people to agree. But how many of us reexamine fundamental assumptions? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=702.38s)]
*  The fundamental assumption here was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=708.38s)]
*  That assumption should have been carefully reexamined, and there were opportunities to do [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=714.22s)]
*  it. But policymakers didn't reexamine it because they felt absolutely certain that the lessons of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=720.46s)]
*  history suggested that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=727.26s)]
*  You say it was the most consequential foreign policy decision of the 21st century. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=731.34s)]
*  How did it reverberate in things like Obama's decisions on Syria and other things that could [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=736.22s)]
*  have been different had we not done this invasion? Oh, I think they had profound influence on [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=743.58s)]
*  on President Obama's inclination to get deeply involved in regime change in Syria. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=751.26s)]
*  It certainly influenced his initial actions to withdraw completely from Iraq, thereby providing [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=760.46s)]
*  opportunity for ISIS or the Islamic State to regroup and gain more and more power in the region [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=769.98s)]
*  before troops again were reinserted to stifle ISIS and to defeat the Islamic State. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=778.22s)]
*  Was that a mistake on Obama's part to withdraw from Iraq? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=790.14s)]
*  I think many experts now feel that the total withdrawal that occurred under Obama probably [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=793.5s)]
*  was an error. That is not to say that people think or I think that there should have been [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=804.54s)]
*  a continued deployment of large numbers of combat troops. But the critical factor during the years [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=811.8199999999999s)]
*  of Obama, especially in 2011 and 2012, the critical factor was whether to keep in a small [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=818.86s)]
*  number of troops to continue the training and the support of the Iraqi army. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=828.2199999999999s)]
*  So do you think that this problem, the really bad problem we had after the Iraq invasion, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=833.42s)]
*  has made the United States all the way through have these reverberations where we don't know [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=839.8199999999999s)]
*  how to calibrate our involvements in the Middle East? Yes, I think it's chastened the United [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=845.02s)]
*  States. It's made policymakers think very deeply about the use of force. I think that's a good [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=852.9399999999999s)]
*  lesson. I think people should think deeply and systematically about the perspective use of force. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=861.18s)]
*  But it also clearly contributed to the rise of the America first, of MAGA America, because [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=870.4599999999999s)]
*  President Donald Trump certainly campaigned on the notion that the so-called forever wars in [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=880.54s)]
*  Afghanistan and Iraq were totally inconsistent with American interests and led to commitments [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=888.14s)]
*  that was totally self-defeating. And so much of the growing American first is a most much of the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=897.1s)]
*  present American hesitation, especially on the far right, even to give assistance to Ukraine at this [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=906.86s)]
*  very moment goes back to what Donald Trump and his supporters believe are the lessons [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=914.86s)]
*  of Afghanistan and Iraq. Stay out of these conflicts. They have nothing to do with U.S. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=922.86s)]
*  interests. Are there some truth to that? These problems abroad do affect American interests. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=927.98s)]
*  And the challenge for policymakers, the challenge for you, Walter, and for me, is to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=939.1s)]
*  determine precisely what is the nature of our interests in Iraq, in Ukraine, et cetera. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=946.7s)]
*  How important is that interest? And then to define tactics commensurate with those interests. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=956.3000000000001s)]
*  So I would say today President Biden is carefully calculating these issues with regard to the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=967.1s)]
*  situation in Ukraine. He understands that undeterred aggression, that Russian aggression left unmet [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=976.0600000000001s)]
*  is a dangerous precedent both for Europe and for what might in the future happen in East Asia. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=991.02s)]
*  He understands that. And I think that he is right about that. At the same time, he has carefully [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=999.5s)]
*  tried to calculate that although that is an important interest, an overriding priority is [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1006.14s)]
*  not to get engaged in a full-scale war with Russia because that might culminate in the use of nuclear [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1014.0600000000001s)]
*  weapons. So I see President Biden trying carefully to calculate the nature of American interests [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1023.34s)]
*  and to prioritize them and to design tactics that are commensurate with the priorities he [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1032.94s)]
*  is assigning to those interests. And I think that's the lessons to be learned here. It's not, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1041.26s)]
*  yes, we have an interest in Iraq or we don't have an interest in Iraq. We do have interests in Iraq. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1048.54s)]
*  We have interests in the Middle East. But the challenge is how great are those interests [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1055.1s)]
*  and what sorts of tactics should be employed in pursuit of those interests? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1060.46s)]
*  Professor Mel Loeffler, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1067.74s)]
*  It's been a great pleasure talking to you. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOEMLaxkBDo&t=1071.1s)]
