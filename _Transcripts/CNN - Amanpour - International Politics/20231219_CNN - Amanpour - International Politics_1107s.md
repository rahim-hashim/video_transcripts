Video Description: As 2023 comes to a close, we look ahead to a new year that is set to bring a world of challenges -- from turmoil in the Middle East and a gruelling battle in Ukraine to growing tensions over Taiwan, and more than half the global population heading to the polls in a ground-breaking year of elections. Deputy Editor of The Economist Tom Standage joins the show to discuss his article "The Ten Trends to Watch in 2024."

# Over Half the World Has an Election in 2024 and Democracy Is on the Ballot  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E)
*  Now, as the year comes to a close, we look ahead to 2024, which is set to bring a world of challenges, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=0.0s)]
*  from turmoil in the Middle East, a grueling battle in Ukraine, to growing tensions over Taiwan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=6.32s)]
*  And on top of that, more than half the global population is heading to the polls in a groundbreaking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=11.68s)]
*  year of elections, the most important of which will be in the United States, and that will likely [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=17.6s)]
*  be a Trump-Biden rematch. Deputy Editor of The Economist, Tom Stangish, joins Hari Sreenivasan [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=22.48s)]
*  to discuss the 10 trends to watch in 2024. Christian, thanks. Tom Stangish, thanks so much [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=28.48s)]
*  for joining us. You write in The World Ahead in 2024 that it is a pivotal year for democracies. Why so? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=34.8s)]
*  Well, we think it's the first time in human history where most people in the world, more than half of [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=42.56s)]
*  the global population, live in a country that will hold an election in 2024. So it's about 4.2 billion [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=48.72s)]
*  people, and the population of the world, as you know, is 8.1 billion. So that means that more than [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=56.16s)]
*  half, most people in the world, are living in a country that will have a national election [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=62.48s)]
*  in the coming year. And that's never happened before. And so you would say, well, that surely [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=66.64s)]
*  is a triumph for democracy. But I think it's going to put a spotlight on the nature of democracy, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=71.12s)]
*  and the fact that there is more to democracy than voting, that there's, yeah, sure, a great big [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=76.64s)]
*  quantity of voting happening, but there's a huge quantity and quality when it comes to democracy. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=82.4s)]
*  You know, you have a quote in there that I want to pull out. It says, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  in theory, it should be a triumphant year for democracy. In practice, it will be the opposite. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=92.0s)]
*  Why? Well, because a lot of these democracies are extremely flawed. So at The Economist, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=97.76s)]
*  our sister company, the EIU, actually prepares something called a democracy index, and it gives [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=104.0s)]
*  every democracy around the world a score. And some countries are classed as full democracies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=108.96s)]
*  So I'm talking to you from London, and we're going to have an election in Britain in 2024. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  And it seems very likely that the current government will be chucked out. And that's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=120.8s)]
*  one of the features of democracy, that you should be able to vote to change the government or change [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  the leadership. And if you go to the other end of the spectrum, we also know there's going to be an [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=130.48s)]
*  election in Russia in 2024. And I can tell you what the result of that election is going to be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=134.64s)]
*  right now. Vladimir Putin is going to be, he's going to win, he's going to continue to be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  president of Russia. And he wouldn't be having that election at all, unless he was sure that he [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=143.04s)]
*  could guarantee that outcome. So that's not a democracy. That is a sham. And then you have [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=146.88s)]
*  lots of other countries in the middle that sort of are more or less authoritarian. And then sort [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=152.48s)]
*  of right at the top, just below the full democracies, you get the flawed democracies. And I have to say [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=157.6s)]
*  that the two biggest democracies in the world, India and the United States, both of which are [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=163.04s)]
*  voting next year, are both classified as flawed democracies for one reason or another. So it is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  still possible for the outcome to change the leadership of the country, but there are other [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  problems with their democracies. Being here in the United States, I've got to ask, what is the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  definition of flawed? And why does the United States meet that of a flawed democracy? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=181.6s)]
*  So there's no single definition. It's a question of how many points you score on a range of metrics. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  But essentially, in the case of the US, there's a few problems. There's very clearly a sort of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=192.24s)]
*  breakdown in trust in the whole democratic process. Whether you're on the left or the right, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=196.16s)]
*  you think that the process is broken in one way or another. And then there's also things like, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=200.56s)]
*  you know, I mean, as an outsider, it seems extraordinary that in America, politicians are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  allowed to draw the boundaries of their own elections. You have sort of partisan boundary [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=210.24s)]
*  commissions. And we're not in the whole of America. I think California has sort of gone back to the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=214.96s)]
*  sort of situation you get in many other parts of the world. But essentially, that means that you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=219.6s)]
*  can draw electoral boundaries that guarantee that your guy always wins. And what does that mean? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=223.6s)]
*  The only way that you can lose in a situation like that is if you are primaried by someone more [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  extreme from your own party. So that is a recipe for polarization, which is exactly what we've seen [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=235.04s)]
*  in America. And then that in turn leads to a breakdown in trust in the overall democratic [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=240.0s)]
*  process. So that's the kind of thing. I mean, to be fair, I think the US scores seven and a bit out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=244.16s)]
*  of 10, which is pretty good. It's only just a pool of democracy. Now you are also a publication [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=249.36s)]
*  that says that this election coming in the United States is incredibly important. It's one of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=255.68s)]
*  if not the most crucial that our future is on the line that we have heard that over and over again, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=260.56s)]
*  from 2016 to 2012, 2020. So what's different about it this time? You think? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, a few things. I think last time, Donald Trump was president, he tried to do various things. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=273.04s)]
*  And a lot of the things he tried to do, he was prevented from doing. And this time around, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=278.64s)]
*  he seems to be planning to ensure that he can make more of the changes he wants to politicize the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=285.12s)]
*  sort of executive, the things like the Department of Justice, he wants to chuck out everybody and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=293.04s)]
*  replace them with his own people who can then prosecute his enemies and that sort of thing. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=298.32s)]
*  So that's very concerning. And also, he's making noises about how, you know, at the end of the term, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=302.72s)]
*  if he wins again, he might want to stay on for a bit longer. I think there's a word for that, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=308.32s)]
*  where you get to stay in power for as long as you like. And I seem to remember that you weren't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=312.56s)]
*  terribly keen on that arrangement in the 18th century. But anyway, so there's that. But I think [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  the other big difference is that the world now is sort of much more aware of the global implications [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=322.56s)]
*  of a second Trump presidency. If Americans want to vote for Donald Trump in America, that's fine. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=328.48s)]
*  That's, of course, up to them. And it's their democratic choice. But the global implications [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=333.84s)]
*  would potentially be huge. He's talking about pulling out of NATO, obviously, he wants to pull [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=338.56s)]
*  the plug on support for Ukraine. We don't know what he'd do over Taiwan. I wonder what the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=342.23999999999995s)]
*  consequences is of reelecting a president that was discontent with the results last time and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=347.44s)]
*  actively tried to overturn those results. If he was to get back in power, what does that signal, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=356.0s)]
*  I guess, to the world about us, the grand experiment that is democracy? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. America is not a great advertisement for democracy right now. And it would be an even [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  worse one if you have an election denier who comes back in, says that maybe we don't need [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=372.8s)]
*  elections anymore in the future. The other weird thing about it was that in the 2020 election, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  he's cast doubt on the big lie is that he really won the presidential election. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=384.64s)]
*  But miraculously, the cheating only, he claims, happened for the presidential election. And all of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=390.0s)]
*  the Senate seats and the House representative seats, all of that worked fine. It seems very [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  implausible that the meddling only happens in one part of the ticket when people are voting on the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  same piece of paper. So yeah, the whole thing is deeply implausible. And it would just send a very [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  odd message to people around the world to whom America is trying to preach the virtues of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=414.08s)]
*  democracy. But America doesn't preach the virtues of democracy quite as much as it used to. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=418.4s)]
*  And the place where democracy really needs defending right now is Ukraine. And it's pretty [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=422.56s)]
*  clear that Republicans don't want to be continuing to support Ukraine financially and militarily in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=426.88s)]
*  the way that it has been. And that's very perilous, not just for Ukraine, but for a European [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=432.56s)]
*  democracy that is in grave danger. I wonder, since you mentioned Ukraine, right now, one of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=438.56s)]
*  the central premises for President Biden is that we need to support democracies such as Ukraine [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=446.08s)]
*  with arms. We need to support the democracy that is Israel with our support in the Israel-Gaza [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  conflict. And I wonder, as these tensions keep getting strained further and further, and as the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  public might evolve their thinking about what they're willing to stomach, what does that do to that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=466.32s)]
*  underlying principle that seems to be the binding factor here, which is that we need to support [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=472.32s)]
*  democracies? Yeah, exactly. And I think America has gone through isolationist periods in the past, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=476.88s)]
*  and it seems to be going into one now. I think what I'd say, particularly with regard to Ukraine, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=483.12s)]
*  because that seems to be where there is more resistance to continued funding. And we know [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=488.0s)]
*  that the Republicans historically have beef with Ukraine and with Volodymyr Zelensky in particular. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=492.24s)]
*  But just being completely looking at an accountant's view of this, this is an incredible [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  deal for the United States to basically wear down the military of one of your biggest geopolitical [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=503.04s)]
*  rivals without having to put American servicemen and women in the line of fire at very low cost, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=508.64s)]
*  because in effect, the subsidies that you give to Ukraine are going straight, for a large part of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=514.88s)]
*  it, going straight to your own arms companies. So it's subsidies, it's creating jobs at home [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=520.24s)]
*  in America, and it's wearing down the Russian military at very, this is an incredible deal. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=526.32s)]
*  So even if you don't care at all about democracy, but you do care about America's continuing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=534.08s)]
*  military supremacy over other powers, then I don't know why you wouldn't want to continue [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=541.2s)]
*  to support Ukraine. So yeah, it's a mystery to me. And yes, I realize that there are concerns [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=545.6s)]
*  about border security and so forth, but you can have both, right? I mean, this is a great deal, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=550.32s)]
*  and America should be continuing to support Ukraine just for that reason, for its own self-interest. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=556.0s)]
*  You know, in the magazine, you point out how in Africa right now, there have been nine [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  regime changes in the past three years. What is going on with the shift where people might be [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  in some ways okay with military strongmen? Yes, so there's quite a worrying [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  load of polling coming from South Africa, where people are very upset with the way their democracy [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=584.88s)]
*  is going, that they've had the ANC in power ever since democracy was introduced, a multiracial [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=591.28s)]
*  democracy, and yet they have big, big problems, there's lots of unemployment, the power grid [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=597.04s)]
*  doesn't work, and so forth. So this may be, it seems very likely to be the first election at [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=602.88s)]
*  which the ANC gets less than 50% of the vote. And what's astonishing is that the polling shows that [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=607.36s)]
*  people are less concerned about preserving the democracy, really they want order and they want [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=612.24s)]
*  jobs, and I think it was something like 70% of South African voters said that they would accept [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=616.88s)]
*  a strongman showing up and ruling, and even if that was undemocratic, as long as they sort of, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=621.92s)]
*  you know, fixed the economy and got jobs going again, people really are at the end of their [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=628.08s)]
*  tether on this. And actually, you see the same, you know, not quite to the same extent, but you do see [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=632.16s)]
*  people saying, well, actually, democracy is all fine and good, but, you know, what we really care [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=638.56s)]
*  about is this issue or that issue, and it's very often economic stability or jobs or whatever. So [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=643.76s)]
*  I think there's a danger for those of us who live in democracies that we sort of take it for granted, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=649.76s)]
*  and we think that things would be okay if we had a more authoritarian leader as long as they could [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=654.16s)]
*  make other things work well. Do you see any bright spots in terms of democracy looking out of 2024? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=659.84s)]
*  I have to say I see very few bright spots altogether looking at 2024. This is a world [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  of increasing disorder. It's a world where they're increasing these sort of zones of impunity, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=670.72s)]
*  where nobody in particular is in charge. You've got Iran's proxies causing trouble across the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  Middle East. You have this short war between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Russia's backyard. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=681.04s)]
*  Then you've got the whole situation in the Sahel. You can now walk from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=687.76s)]
*  26,000 kilometers, just passing through countries that have had a coup since 2020. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=692.64s)]
*  So the world seems to be preparing for a situation where there's more conflict in future [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=697.92s)]
*  rather than less. The unipolar moment where America was the sole superpower [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=702.8s)]
*  has definitely passed, and there are now many great powers, large powers, sort of vying for [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=708.0s)]
*  influence. And then the middle powers, this makes the middle powers, the sort of swing powers like [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=714.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Iran and Turkey, gives them a lot more clout as well. And so there's just [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=718.24s)]
*  a general kind of feeling that if you want to do something like invade your neighbor, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=723.76s)]
*  now's a good time. And Venezuela's talking about invading Guyana. I mean, there does seem to be a [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=727.52s)]
*  sort of move towards much greater disorder and much more conflict. And I'm afraid that's extremely [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=733.28s)]
*  depressing. So I've looked for bright spots in 2024, but I'm afraid there really isn't a lot [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=738.16s)]
*  to celebrate. Is there a new Cold War if there were to be these sort of multi-powers, multi-polls? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=742.96s)]
*  I mean, is there a Cold War now brewing between China and the United States? And what does that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  look like going forward? Yeah, no, absolutely there is a Cold War. So if you then, yes, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=755.6s)]
*  you've got a multi-polar world, but as a sort of higher level of abstraction, you've essentially [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  got a China-led bloc, which does include Russia. And then you've got a Western, American-led bloc. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=765.76s)]
*  You've got countries trying not to take sides in the middle, like India, most obviously, but [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=771.84s)]
*  other countries too, who sort of want to be friends with both sides. Vietnam is doing a great job of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=777.2800000000001s)]
*  playing both sides. Southeast Asia is generally trying to be friends with China, or at least not [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=782.88s)]
*  enemies, but also be friends with America. So yes, it is very much a Cold War vibe. The big [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  difference though, between this and the original Cold War, is that there was no trade to speak of [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=792.0s)]
*  between the West and the Soviet Union during the original Cold War. And there is an enormous [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=796.96s)]
*  amount of trade and economic linkage between China and the West. And just think of your iPhone [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=801.52s)]
*  again. It's assembled in China, and it has components from actually all over Asia. But [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=806.72s)]
*  this is a very different situation, because supply chains are so dependent on China. So this is why [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=811.76s)]
*  we hear a lot about decoupling and de-risking, and companies trying to move their supply chains [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  and their factories out of China. It's actually incredibly difficult. Because even if you move [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=823.04s)]
*  your assembly to, and this is what Apple is doing with iPhones, it's assembling some of them in [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=826.96s)]
*  India now, and it's moved some other manufacturing to Vietnam. But the fact is, an awful lot of the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=832.24s)]
*  components and materials are still coming from China. So if there were to be a war over Taiwan, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=836.72s)]
*  and there were to be sanctions imposed, then I'm not sure that trying to build things in Vietnam [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=841.68s)]
*  or India would help, because I don't think you'd be able to get any components out of China. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=846.88s)]
*  And Taiwan is one of those places with an election this year. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=850.32s)]
*  It is. And so it's one of the two big elections that we think are most consequential next year, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=854.56s)]
*  are Taiwan at the beginning of the year, and the US at the end of the year. And in Taiwan, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=859.5999999999999s)]
*  there are essentially three candidates, and the two opposition candidates look like they might [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=864.3199999999999s)]
*  have got together, which would have been bad news for the incumbent from the DPP, the ruling party [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=870.2399999999999s)]
*  right now. They haven't been able to get together. So it does mean that the DPP candidate, William [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=876.4799999999999s)]
*  Lai, seems likely to win. And he is more of an independence leaning candidate, whereas the other [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=881.52s)]
*  two say, no, we should be friends with China, and so on. So whatever happens, it really is going to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=886.96s)]
*  set the mood, not just across the Taiwan Strait, but more importantly, on US-China relations. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=893.84s)]
*  Because if I'm Xi Jinping, and William Lai does win, and does sort of make slightly more [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=899.52s)]
*  pro-independence noises, as he is want to do, then of course the first thing I want to do is [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=905.68s)]
*  essentially see what would happen if I do something provocative across the Taiwan Strait. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=912.0s)]
*  Is America the overstretched superpower? Hasn't it got too much on its plate with Ukraine and [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=918.8s)]
*  Gaza and trouble in the Red Sea and all this sort of thing? So the first thing I'm going to want to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=925.28s)]
*  do is not just see how Taiwan responds, but see how America responds. And I'm not saying there's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  going to be an invasion of Taiwan in 2024. That seems incredibly unlikely. But essentially, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=936.4s)]
*  this is going to set the broader framework for US-China relations, the outcome of that election. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=942.72s)]
*  So it's worth watching very closely. So you end your list on a positive note, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=950.96s)]
*  and let's end our conversation there too, about possible unifying moments in 2024. Where do you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=954.88s)]
*  see that happening? Well, there's a few, but I'm afraid I'm a bit skeptical about most of them. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=960.24s)]
*  One of them is the Olympics. And the Olympics can be, even for a jaded old cynic like me, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=966.48s)]
*  can be surprisingly moving to see all of the best people in a particular sport [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=970.72s)]
*  facing off. And you kind of think, actually, this is really cool. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=976.08s)]
*  But the 2024 Olympics are likely to be overshadowed by arguments about what about [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=979.76s)]
*  the athletes from Russia and Belarus? And are they allowed to compete? And do they compete [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=984.72s)]
*  under a neutral flag that doesn't represent their country, but everyone knows that it does, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=989.6s)]
*  and it's all a bit silly? And also, Vladimir Putin says he wants to have his own version of the games [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=992.96s)]
*  called the Friendship Games, which is for Russia and its friends. So that whole thing seems to [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=997.12s)]
*  become a political football already, as it often does. And then there's the possibility of Americans [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1001.52s)]
*  returning to the moon in 2024. There's supposed to be this mission blasting off in November. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1007.36s)]
*  It may get, in November 24, it may get pushed into 25, but they're not going to land on the moon. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1013.2s)]
*  The idea is that they go around the moon. And this should be extremely inspiring, surely. It's [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1017.44s)]
*  going to include the first Black man, the first woman, and the first non-American to leave Earth [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  orbit. And so surely that's a cause for celebration. And to some extent it is. But I think, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1029.52s)]
*  again, this is likely to be overshadowed by the sort of political messaging around this. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1034.0s)]
*  This is very reminiscent of the Cold War. And this is very reminiscent of the warm-up missions [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1037.68s)]
*  that were done before Apollo 11 and the landing in 1969. And so I think this, once again, may look [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1043.44s)]
*  like America flexing its technological muscles and saying, look, we're the best at this. And [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1050.0s)]
*  the same way that we're the best at going to the moon, we're superior in other ways too. So [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1056.32s)]
*  I think it's actually going to be very reminiscent of the Cold War, as we are in now another Cold [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1060.96s)]
*  War. So I'm afraid that the chances of that leading to, in theory, you're going to have four members [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1065.68s)]
*  of the human race in one place and looking back at the Earth and seeing absolutely everybody else. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1070.8s)]
*  And that's, you know, people find pictures of the Earth, the pale blue dots. It can all be very [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1078.32s)]
*  moving, but I suspect that's going to be politically charged as well. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1083.76s)]
*  All right. Deputy Editor of The Economist, Tom Stangish, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1087.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7kcOMALw8E&t=1091.52s)]
