Video Description: Cheers, tears and hugs met Tony Blinken, America’s top diplomat, in Israel today. Earlier Blinken stood alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he said that “a prerequisite for victory over Hamas is moral clarity." Today Netanyahu’s office released graphic images of atrocities against babies, images that were shared with Blinken. As Israel gears up to avenge its dead, the big question on many minds is: What next? Gaza is expected to pay a heavy price for Hamas’ actions. Desperation there is growing: There is no electricity, food and water coming in, and Israel’s energy minister says the siege will remain in place until Israeli hostages are returned. Netanyahu’s longtime confidant and senior adviser Mark Regev joins the program to discuss.

# Israeli PM Adviser on Hostages Taken by Hamas and the Israeli Public's Anger | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss)
*  So on the hostages I'd like to say two things with your permission Christian. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=0.0s)]
*  Number one, it has to be understood that we are watching and we are watching closely. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=4.48s)]
*  And if any harm comes to these hostages we will find those responsible and we will bring them to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=13.52s)]
*  justice and they will pay. And if it takes a year or five years or 25 years, if they are involved [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=22.64s)]
*  in harming those hostages Israel will find them and there will be retribution and that should be [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  perfectly clear. The second thing that has to be said is that what they've done in kidnapping [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=36.4s)]
*  all these people, over a hundred, is against all international law. It is unacceptable behavior [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  and the message from the international community has to be clear, crystal clear, unequivocal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=52.56s)]
*  There should be the immediate and unconditional release of all these hostages period. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Are you not concerned, you say you have eyes on and you're watching very closely, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  that your very heavy bombing campaign inside Gaza may inadvertently, how do you know that you're not [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  inadvertently putting the hostages in danger? Do you know where they are? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=77.68s)]
*  I'm not going to go to what we know and what we don't know, but it is crucial that Israel hit back [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=82.64s)]
*  hard against Hamas. Christian, you and me have both been on different ends, you've been a journalist [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  and I've been in government, but we've been through what is it five, six escalations in Gaza, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  the different rounds of fighting. This is not another escalation. This is not another round of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=101.28s)]
*  another round of Israel Hamas fighting in Gaza. This is war. What they did on Saturday morning [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=109.52s)]
*  when they attacked across a long front in scope and in scale and in sheer brutality of their [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=116.88s)]
*  behavior, which both the prime minister today and the visiting secretary of state described as [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=125.36s)]
*  ISIS-like. That was an escalation of massive proportions. They have declared war on my country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  We didn't want this war, but we are responding in force and we will finish this war. We didn't start [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  it, but we will finish this war on our terms. Malgreev, I need to ask you a question that many [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=148.96s)]
*  Israelis are asking and we see it on social media, we see it on television. There is a great deal of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=154.8s)]
*  anger despite this slaughter that civilians have gone through and that the country is in shock about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=160.32s)]
*  There is a huge amount of anger directed at what they believe was eyes off the ball incompetence [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=166.64s)]
*  in government. I'm just going to read you a couple of polls from the Dialogue Institute. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=172.64s)]
*  84 percent of the public believes that the infiltration of Hamas terrorists into the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=177.76s)]
*  southern settlements were due to negligence of your country's leadership. 94 percent believe [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=182.24s)]
*  that the government is responsible for the situation that led to the collapse of the entire [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=187.92s)]
*  system of protecting the settlements in the south. And 56 percent believe Netanyahu should resign [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=192.32s)]
*  when this fighting is over. And today we saw images on television of a minister being [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  literally heckled and being told by people in a hospital that it's your fault, you've ruined the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=204.16s)]
*  country, you're responsible. So my question to you frankly is how should your people have confidence [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  that this government which claims to have been taken by surprise can actually redeem its people [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=217.2s)]
*  and get the hostages back and do what you say you want to do in Gaza? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  People have every right to be angry. I mean Israelis as you know have for years prided [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  themselves on the excellence of our intelligence services and yet it's clear this time we were [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=238.48s)]
*  surprised. Something went very very wrong. There were also complaints about the IDF's speed of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=244.0s)]
*  response. That's right. Were they very quick enough to to deal with the attackers once they [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=251.68s)]
*  crossed the border? And of course as you've said there were complaints about the political leadership. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=255.76s)]
*  Now on these issues I want to say two things. Number one as the polling also said, Israelis want [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=261.84s)]
*  to win this war and we will and we're now uniting to win this war and though Israel has suffered from [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=268.88s)]
*  a very divisive and polarized politics over the last few months you see us coming together [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=276.56s)]
*  because of the crisis and as you saw last night the formation of this national unity government with [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=283.6s)]
*  parties that used to be in the opposition so as to show a united front. And this is an expression [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=289.92s)]
*  of what the Israeli public wants and once this is over once we have won you know Israeli history. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=296.32s)]
*  We've had inquiries after wars. We know how to investigate ourselves. We will look into [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=303.12s)]
*  what went wrong, what was right. Lessons will be learned. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=308.88s)]
*  you [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRFGxwr0ss&t=326.32s)]
