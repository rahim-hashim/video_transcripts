**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E)
*  Can you guarantee, not just to people like Nathan Law, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=0.0s)]
*  but to people all over the world who value democracy, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=3.6s)]
*  that that will continue? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=7.48s)]
*  I believe that it will continue. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=11.88s)]
*  And, uh, thinking for myself, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I will guarantee that the rule of law in Hong Kong [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=18.88s)]
*  will continue to be independent and strong, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=21.56s)]
*  if given the chance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  At the moment, Hong Kong is not North Korea. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=27.12s)]
*  It's an open society. It's an international city. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  What, in the last 23 years, after the resumption of sovereignty, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=34.7s)]
*  what freedoms have we lost? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=38.4s)]
*  A lot of international people, I'm sure you have friends, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=40.04s)]
*  everybody has friends who live in Hong Kong, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=42.64s)]
*  work in Hong Kong. There's no loss of freedom. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=44.18s)]
*  It's a very open society compared to a lot of places in the world. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  In Article 4 of the legislation, national security legislation, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=49.92s)]
*  it spells out very clearly by the National People's Congress [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=53.96s)]
*  that all these national governments in force in Hong Kong [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=57.72s)]
*  shall be observed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=61.52s)]
*  The whole law is structured for the courts in Hong Kong [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=63.36s)]
*  to apply the common law interpretation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  At the moment, there's no exodus from Hong Kong. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=71.7s)]
*  There is one, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=74.9s)]
*  is a demonization of this law in Hong Kong [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  that this is now a city of doom. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=82.83999999999999s)]
*  This is just another mainland city. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=84.52s)]
*  But ask the other millions of people in Hong Kong [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=86.72s)]
*  who are living under this law every day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=90.17999999999999s)]
*  They're trying to make it work. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=92.38s)]
*  Every country has national security legislation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=94.16s)]
*  Make it law to international norms. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=97.0s)]
*  It's an open society in Hong Kong. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=99.72s)]
*  All justice is dispensed openly here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=102.02s)]
*  What is being argued is, well, Hong Kong has been repressed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=105.3s)]
*  How is everything repressed? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=110.5s)]
*  You've mentioned to Nathan, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=113.0s)]
*  is this a global battle for freedom? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  But he didn't kick up on that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  He said, well, it's a fight for justice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=118.44s)]
*  Well, what exactly? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=121.22s)]
*  What are we fighting for in Hong Kong? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5LwtGdR26E&t=123.38000000000001s)]
