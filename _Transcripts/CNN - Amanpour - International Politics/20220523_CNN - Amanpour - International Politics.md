# Ian Bremmer on NATO Expansion and the Opportunity for American Unity  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA)
*  Now, there was nothing humorous about a warning from the Swiss President today as he was hosting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=0.0s)]
*  the World Economic Forum in Davos. He talked about our world in the throes of multiple [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=5.12s)]
*  crises all at once. That is also the subject of a new book by our next guest, the political [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=9.72s)]
*  scientist Ian Bremmer. In The Power of Crisis, How Three Threats and Our Response Will Change [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=14.56s)]
*  the World, Ian Bremmer looks at how we can better prepare for the global challenges ahead. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=20.32s)]
*  And here he is talking to Walter Isaacson about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=25.6s)]
*  Thank you, Christiane and Ian Bremmer. Welcome to the show. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=32.4s)]
*  Your doctoral dissertation at Stanford was called The Politics of Ethnicity, Russia in the Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=33.76s)]
*  And you've worked in the past with Boris Nemtsov, who was a great democracy advocate in Russia, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=42.64s)]
*  who got assassinated. Tell me what your thinking was back then about Russia and Ukraine, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=47.76s)]
*  how it's changed and what this means for Putin. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  You're bringing me way back. I started my dissertation back in 1989. How could one [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  possibly not work on the nationalities explosion in the former Soviet Union? This was world [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=63.36s)]
*  changing. It was empire shattering. And what was pretty clear to me from having lived for a year [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  in Ukraine back in 1992, in fact, I attended their first ever Diennissalgenosti, their day [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=77.68s)]
*  of independence, was first of all, just how extraordinary it is to build a new country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=84.4s)]
*  Secondly, the fact that the Ukrainians and Russians in Kiev, and Kiev, as they referred to it at that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=91.84s)]
*  point, got along extremely well and thought of each other as fraternal nations is very friendly, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=99.12s)]
*  very engaged. But also that when you traveled, as I did, down to Crimea and down to parts of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  southeast Ukraine, that this was a very different place. And that the challenges of identity, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  of historical attachments, of power and capital, these were not going to suddenly be resolved [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  by the independence of Ukraine as a country. So there was, in other words, there was a lot [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  to think about and play for back in 1994, when I submitted my dissertation in thinking about Russia [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=134.56s)]
*  and Ukraine on the ground. You've said that this has the opportunity to unify NATO, unify Democrats [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=141.84s)]
*  and Republicans even. But how long can that be sustained if this is a two, three, four year process? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to first of all say that for NATO and for Europe, Walter, this is a generational change. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=155.52s)]
*  So what has ended is a peace dividend of 30 years. What has ended is the idea that the Europeans [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=163.04s)]
*  don't need to be spending on their own defense, don't need to be focused on their own national [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=170.16s)]
*  security. And indeed, that the Germans now understand that they're going to spend twice [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=176.32s)]
*  as much on defense going forward, that the Europeans understand, with very few exceptions, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=183.12s)]
*  Hungary, the notable exception, that they are going to decouple themselves from the Russian [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  economy at great expense, even in terms of things like coal and oil and gas and faster than anyone [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=193.12s)]
*  would have expected. I think that is permanent. I think it's generational. I think that for the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=200.16s)]
*  Europeans, the Russian invasion into Ukraine is an existential threat to democracy. For the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=206.0s)]
*  United States, it's a bigger question. And I don't feel as confident that the United States [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=212.8s)]
*  in a year or in 2024 with the presidential election coming up will be as committed and as focused [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=219.44s)]
*  on a country that's far away that the Russians have done almost no business with the United [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=228.0s)]
*  States. There are very few refugees that make it to the U.S. The U.S. is not part of Europe. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  I do think the potential for the Americans to end up more divided on this issue is real, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  but I think that's an open question. And there is a real opportunity for the Americans not only to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=243.36s)]
*  rebuild and revitalize what had been a NATO adrift, but also bring in the Asian democracies and allies [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=249.84s)]
*  to become a broader part of that, something that clearly was not seen as possible on February 23rd. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=259.2s)]
*  You've said that it was very difficult to maintain a front against Russia when our relations with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=266.96s)]
*  China seem to be degenerating, spiraling out of control. Do you think this is an opportunity [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=274.48s)]
*  and a necessity for us to do a reset with China? I don't think that we have a relationship of trust [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=280.8s)]
*  with China. I think that's mutual, and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. But [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=288.32s)]
*  when on February 4th, three weeks before the invasion, Xi Jinping and President Putin [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=294.24s)]
*  got on a stage in the opening of the Beijing Olympics and declared to the world that they had [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=302.48s)]
*  a friendship without limits, I will tell you that in the end of May, that relationship looks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=307.68s)]
*  different. That relationship feels like a friendship with not that many benefits. And if you [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=314.64s)]
*  look at Xi Jinping's private conversations in the last couple of weeks with Chancellor [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=320.72s)]
*  Schultz and with President Macron in France, they've been talking as if they really don't [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=324.8s)]
*  want to be tarred with the same brush as Putin has been, that they want territorial integrity [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=332.8s)]
*  with Ukraine, they want to be friends with everyone, they want to ceasefire, they don't [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=338.16s)]
*  want a new Cold War. I think they're being much more cautious. And I also think, I do expect, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=342.72s)]
*  with Biden's trip to Asia, that there will be a phone call with Xi Jinping. There will be [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=348.08s)]
*  direct engagement. I note that the White House has been talking about maybe trying to reduce [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=353.28s)]
*  or remove some of the tariffs on China that were set in the Trump administration, because, frankly, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=359.12s)]
*  inflation right now is a very big issue affecting the American voters and not helping Biden's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=365.52s)]
*  popularity one bit. And the Chinese would surely welcome that. I think the Chinese have taken a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  number of lessons away from the extraordinary level of unity that the United States and allies [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=377.52s)]
*  have shown in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I do think that that affects the way they [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  think about Taiwan going forward. And I think it affects the way they think about their relationship [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=390.4s)]
*  with the West going forward in ways that can be constructive for the Americans. If you were [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=395.12s)]
*  Jake Sullivan or Kurt Campbell or Anthony Blinken helping arrange Biden's trip to Asia, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=400.8s)]
*  would you have him both call Xi Jinping in China and maybe even offer to have a summit [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=408.24s)]
*  between the American president and the Chinese leader? 100 percent. Biden's meeting with Putin [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=414.56s)]
*  a year ago in Geneva was something that Biden very much wanted to do. I don't think that's [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=421.04s)]
*  feasible going forward because Biden feels like Putin has lied to his face and is a war criminal. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=426.88s)]
*  Biden never talks about Xi Jinping that way. He talks about how much the two men have gotten to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=431.92s)]
*  know each other when Biden was vice president and Xi Jinping was vice president. Biden's proud of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=437.6s)]
*  that. And it's not that they agree on everything, but they feel like they have a level of mutual [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=443.04s)]
*  understanding and respect for each other. Biden is a big believer in personal diplomacy. He's a big [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=447.6s)]
*  believer that when two individuals get together and speak honestly with each other, they have the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=454.96s)]
*  ability to resolve problems. And especially because Biden is being so welcomed by the new [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=460.56s)]
*  South Korean president, just came into office two weeks ago, very aligned with the United States, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  with the Japanese, the relatively new Japanese prime minister, very assertive on the global stage, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=471.12s)]
*  very popular at home, and also with a meeting of the quid that Trump presidency started, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=476.24s)]
*  but the Biden presidency continues to grow, that includes also Australia and India. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=483.2s)]
*  The fact is that the Chinese do not want to feel like the only purpose of American policy in Asia [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=489.28s)]
*  is to contain them. And frankly, that feeling has been part of the reason why Putin and Xi ended [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=497.44s)]
*  up on the global stage the way they did. I feel quite confident that Biden will want to address [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=503.84s)]
*  that directly. If Biden does address directly the Chinese issue, has a summit with Xi Jinping, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=509.6s)]
*  do you think that will cause a widening of the political divide in Washington? Because one of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=517.12s)]
*  the things that Republicans and Democrats have agreed on recently is that we're in a very deep [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=523.6s)]
*  rivalry with China. Yeah, there's no question that there's massive agreement among Democrats [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=529.84s)]
*  and Republicans with very limited exception in how to respond to Putin, how to respond to Russia, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=535.44s)]
*  so much so that Trump has been relatively quiet on this issue, and even backtrack a bit when Putin [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=542.48s)]
*  invaded Ukraine, said, well, that's not the Putin that I knew. So on China, I think Biden has been [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=549.6s)]
*  very cautious. I think that Ron Klain, his chief of staff, who is obviously critical on these issues, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  has been very cautious because they understand that a Biden who might be perceived as soft on [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=564.8s)]
*  China could lose your votes, did lose them votes in swing states back in 2020. And obviously, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=571.52s)]
*  they don't want that to happen again. But Biden is much more concerned about inflation at home. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=579.3599999999999s)]
*  Biden is much more concerned about the future of the global order and Americans' role in it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=587.04s)]
*  And I don't think he is prepared. He appointed John Kerry, and on climate, he said the Chinese [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=593.68s)]
*  and the Americans need to work together. He said, you go and do it. And I don't think he was worried [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=599.04s)]
*  about backlash when he sent Kerry over to Beijing and said, find a way to work with the Chinese. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=603.28s)]
*  One of the maxims in foreign policy comes from the cartoon character Pogo, who said a long time ago, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  we've met the enemy and it is us. Yeah. And so in your book, you talk about the dysfunction [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=615.12s)]
*  of democracy and how that's something that we have to fix and we have the opportunity to fix [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=622.8s)]
*  because of a lot of these crises that have come along. How important is it, do you think, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=629.12s)]
*  for us to concentrate on fixing our democracy at home? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  You started this interview asking about my dissertation. When I started writing my [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=638.4s)]
*  dissertation, it was 1989. America's greatest strength were our ideas, our political system. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  That's why the wall came down because the people on the other side wanted their system to be more [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=650.24s)]
*  like ours. They aspired to have the kind of individual liberties and civil society that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=655.36s)]
*  the United States embodied. And that is not true anymore. Thirty years later, the American [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=660.8s)]
*  institutions have eroded. They have fragmented. They have become delegitimized. Every day we see [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=668.08s)]
*  new unprecedented things. We see a Supreme Court opinion leak. It's never happened before. We see [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=673.6800000000001s)]
*  people demonstrating in front of the homes of Supreme Court justices. It's never happened before. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  January 6th had never happened before. All of these unprecedented things because we Americans [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=684.96s)]
*  increasingly don't believe in our own political system. So clearly, if you do not address that, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  your ability to continue to function as the North Star, the leading light for other countries around [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  the world, you can forget about it. And that is, I think that's a big challenge for the United States. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=703.5200000000001s)]
*  In your book, you paint some scenarios that might stem from this dysfunction and this distrust of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=710.64s)]
*  government that you've just talked about. And one of them is that big technology companies, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=717.5200000000001s)]
*  global technology companies, will end up with a lot more power and a techno-utopianism in which [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=723.44s)]
*  governments will play a smaller role. Do you think that's likely? And explain what that would be. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=731.44s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure how likely it is that that will feel like a utopia, but I think it's very [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=736.64s)]
*  clear that technology companies are functionally sovereign in the digital space as opposed to the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=741.92s)]
*  physical world. So let me give you an obvious example. Russia invades Ukraine. NATO provides [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=748.56s)]
*  javelin missiles and stingers and tanks and helicopters. But in terms of defending Ukraine [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=755.5999999999999s)]
*  from Russia by cyber attack, that's actually Microsoft and Google and IBM. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=762.88s)]
*  I mean, literally, it's not the government. It's private technology companies that are deciding [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=769.28s)]
*  as companies how they want to act. And that's kind of astonishing. It's very new. And so if [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=774.56s)]
*  you want to think about the dangers that come from disruptive technologies like cyber and like [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  algorithms for disinformation and like lethal autonomous drones and like quantum computing, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=787.2s)]
*  we have to recognize the principal actors in that space are not just governments anymore. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=794.24s)]
*  They're actually tech companies. So we now have a lot of very new, very dangerous disruptive [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=799.2800000000001s)]
*  technologies. And it's not going to be just about governments taking action to ensure that they do [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=805.44s)]
*  not proliferate. From the get go, it's going to also be private sector corporations. And that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=811.92s)]
*  means any institutions that we create to try to facilitate that regulatory space, that governance [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  will not just be about governance, but it will also be about tech companies. It's kind of a post [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=825.92s)]
*  Westphalian order in the virtual world that affects all of us. It affects the global economy, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=831.92s)]
*  affects our personal security, and it affects national security around the world. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=838.16s)]
*  After World War II, we developed a lot of institutions that served as guardrails [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=842.8s)]
*  against the threats we might be facing political economic military, whether it be NATO or the World [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  Bank or the IMF and the United Nations even. Nowadays, those institutions don't seem suited [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=854.7199999999999s)]
*  to be the guardrails. Do we need a whole new set of institutions to serve as the guardrails [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=863.04s)]
*  for this new era? Of course we do, Walter, because the fact look what has happened in the world, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=869.76s)]
*  you have economic cycles. Every seven years on average, we have an economic recession. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=877.12s)]
*  And we know how to identify it. We have the playbook, it's monetary, it's fiscal tools. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=883.28s)]
*  Probably heading into a global recession right now, hopefully not a deep one, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=889.76s)]
*  and then we'll come out of it. The interesting thing is that there are geopolitical boom and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=892.96s)]
*  bust cycles too. And the world is right now in a geopolitical recession. And the reason you get [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=898.08s)]
*  geopolitical bust cycles is because the institutions that you create around the world, when you create [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=903.68s)]
*  them, they're very aligned with the balance of power in the world at that point. And the values [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=910.72s)]
*  and preferences and priorities of the countries that are most important in the world. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=917.04s)]
*  And over time, that balance of power changes, but the institutions are sticky. They don't change. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=921.68s)]
*  And when the gap between the institutions and the balance of power becomes great, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=928.8s)]
*  the institutions start to break down. They become obsolete. They become delegitimized. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=933.28s)]
*  And then you need new institutions. You have to either reform them dramatically, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=938.64s)]
*  or you have to create new ones. Give me an example of a new institution with a new ideology. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=943.36s)]
*  You would start right now. We do not have globally any institutions that deal with the proliferation [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=948.4s)]
*  of disruptive technologies. We need one. For climate change, we have an intergovernmental panel [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=956.48s)]
*  for climate change. And every year, all of these scientists and public policy people come together [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=965.12s)]
*  and they say, what is the state of challenge that we have with climate change? And as a consequence, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=970.16s)]
*  we all agree that there is climate change. It's 1.2 degrees centigrade so far. It's manmade. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=974.88s)]
*  It's not natural circumstance. And here are the implications. We have not yet done that at all [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  for disruptive technology. So it's very clear that we need an intergovernmental panel [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=986.8s)]
*  on artificial intelligence, where you'd put together public policy experts, technologists, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=991.52s)]
*  scientists from the private sector and from the public sector globally to identify first what the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=997.68s)]
*  state of play, the state of danger is with lethal autonomous weapons, the state of play with [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1004.0s)]
*  bio weapons, the state of play with dangerous algorithms, because you can't fix a problem until [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1008.88s)]
*  you at least agree on what the problem is. And the reason we're responding so effectively to Russia [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1014.56s)]
*  as the West is because everyone agrees that what Putin did is wrong. Well, it took us decades to [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1020.2399999999999s)]
*  agree that climate change was real, that the science wasn't fake, and that we had to respond [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1025.6s)]
*  to it. Now we are there. And as a consequence, we're making a hell of a lot of progress. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  You need architecture to do that. You need institutions to do that. And that's what has [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1036.24s)]
*  to come in response to disruptive technology. Ian Bremmer, thanks for joining us. Thank you, Walter. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1041.1999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o9VwGlPfLA&t=1055.6s)]
