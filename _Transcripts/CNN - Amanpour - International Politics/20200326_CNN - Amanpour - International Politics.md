# Spanish Foreign Minister on the State of Her Country  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs)
*  One out of ten confirmed cases of the virus are among medical workers in your country. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the highest in Spain. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=4.8s)]
*  I mean, what more do you have to do to protect these frontline warriors? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=6.8s)]
*  So we are protecting the frontline warriors. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=10.8s)]
*  We are protecting them with equipment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  We are protecting them with protocols. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  But it is, in a way, inevitable that a number of them get infected from treating the patient. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=17.8s)]
*  Let's not forget that we are treating massive numbers, especially in one region. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=26.0s)]
*  More than 50% of the cases in Spain are in Madrid. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=31.0s)]
*  More than 75% of those deceased are over 80 years of age. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=34.6s)]
*  We've got a concentration. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=41.6s)]
*  It is terrible to see. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=43.0s)]
*  It's human suffering. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=45.0s)]
*  But we think, again, that with the measures we have taken, we are on course to beat the coronavirus and to flatten the curve. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=46.5s)]
*  It's a huge effort. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=55.1s)]
*  Every country, in a way, is learning about how to beat the virus by doing it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=56.4s)]
*  There is no magic recipe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=62.6s)]
*  Every country is having to, in a way, build on what the predecessors have done and struggle to find the right way to confront it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=64.2s)]
*  Some took it lightly, in a way, and said, OK, let's ensure there is global, some sort of herd immunity by making sure people get a lot of contact. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=72.9s)]
*  They also have had to change track. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=84.0s)]
*  Some started with lighter confinement measures. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=86.5s)]
*  They are having to take stronger measures. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  We are all in a trial, in a test and trial effort to beat the virus. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=92.30000000000001s)]
*  The most important thing, in my view, is to be determined and to follow very carefully all the recommendations that we are getting from the scientists, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  whether they are from the World Health Organization, the European scientists or our own ones in Spain, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=108.5s)]
*  making sure that the decisions we take for Spain are grounded in the science that we get from them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=114.5s)]
*  And yet that health worker told us that they have to wear garbage bags, foreign minister, to protect themselves while trying to protect and treat people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=121.9s)]
*  And this is important because you have this week, in fact, yesterday, reached out to NATO and asked for help. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=131.0s)]
*  NATO, the military alliance you've asked for help, requesting one and a half million surgical masks, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  half a million rapid tests, nearly half a million respirators and more than 500 mechanic ventilators. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  What is NATO? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=151.5s)]
*  NATO is all your neighbours dealing with the same issues. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=155.1s)]
*  What do you expect to get from them? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=158.5s)]
*  Well, what we are doing is purchasing material and we have purchased worth of 500 million US dollars just in the last couple of days, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=161.0s)]
*  worth of masks, worth of glasses, worth of testing, rapid testing kits. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw814f9wNEs&t=169.39999999999998s)]
