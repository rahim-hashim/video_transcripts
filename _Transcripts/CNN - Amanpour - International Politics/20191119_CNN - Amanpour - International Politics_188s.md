# Lena Headey on “Game of Thrones” and the IRC  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [November 19, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU)
*  I went to Lesvos three years ago with the IRC, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=0.0s)]
*  which I'm a voice for. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=3.0s)]
*  International Rescue Committee. Yes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=5.0s)]
*  And we went back to look at their mental health program [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=8.0s)]
*  that they're running, and also to go inside [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=11.0s)]
*  the reception center, Moria, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=15.0s)]
*  which is a government-run place. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=18.0s)]
*  Run by the Greek government. Yes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=20.0s)]
*  And no one's really been in there before. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=22.0s)]
*  What did you find? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=25.0s)]
*  It's appalling. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=27.0s)]
*  It was unforgivable. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=30.0s)]
*  I spoke to a lot of people who were in there, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=33.0s)]
*  who were stuck there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=35.0s)]
*  It's unthinkable. It's horribly unsafe for women and children. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=37.0s)]
*  The women don't use the toilets at night. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=39.0s)]
*  There's no lighting after dark. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=41.0s)]
*  Because they're afraid of getting attacked. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=43.0s)]
*  I mean, rape is an everyday occurrence. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=45.0s)]
*  Are you serious? Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=47.0s)]
*  Rape is an everyday occurrence? Yes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=49.0s)]
*  That is shocking. Yes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=52.0s)]
*  Why do we not know this? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=54.0s)]
*  I don't know why we don't know this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=56.0s)]
*  It was horrendous to listen to stories. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=58.0s)]
*  Did they give you any assurance [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=61.0s)]
*  that they were going to help people in this regard? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=63.0s)]
*  I mean, is there any security that they can put there [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=67.0s)]
*  to make sure the women are safer? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=70.0s)]
*  I mean, the camp is manned by police and military. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=72.0s)]
*  They also have six psychologists on site. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=76.0s)]
*  I don't know how often that is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=79.0s)]
*  You hear very different tales from the officials, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=81.0s)]
*  from the people that are in there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=84.0s)]
*  The medical team come and go. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=86.0s)]
*  I think they find it overwhelming. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=88.0s)]
*  They don't have a place to work from. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=90.0s)]
*  There's a lot of illness in the camp. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=93.0s)]
*  And people are just told, we'll just go to the chemists. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=96.0s)]
*  So nothing's diagnosed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=99.0s)]
*  So people get ill and that spreads. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=101.0s)]
*  It's deeply unsanitary. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=103.0s)]
*  And it's been going on for years now? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=105.0s)]
*  For, yeah, the last kind of six years. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=107.0s)]
*  And at Christmas it was full of 9,000 people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=110.0s)]
*  Now it's at 5,000. The capacity is 3,000. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=113.0s)]
*  So I dread to think... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=116.0s)]
*  What's going to happen next? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=118.0s)]
*  Look, I mean, it must be really different [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=120.0s)]
*  and very strange for you to come from, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, a fairly privileged environment, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=126.0s)]
*  where you're a Hollywood movie star, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=129.0s)]
*  where you're Game of Thrones, where the whole world knows you. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=131.0s)]
*  You have money and fame and all this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=134.0s)]
*  To go there and see that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=137.0s)]
*  It was such a total culture shock, was it, for you? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=140.0s)]
*  It... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=144.0s)]
*  I mean, before I got famous, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=146.0s)]
*  because I'm sort of a Yorkshire lass, you know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=148.0s)]
*  and I never expected this to happen to me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=151.0s)]
*  I've always had an interest in humanitarian work. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=153.0s)]
*  I travelled to India as a backpacker for six years running, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=156.0s)]
*  because I was obsessed with it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=160.0s)]
*  But I'd never seen anything like the refugee crisis. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=162.0s)]
*  I'd never seen such a lack of humanity. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=165.0s)]
*  I've never seen some... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=169.0s)]
*  ..sort of carelessness where people are concerned. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dbnof9JEDU&t=173.0s)]
