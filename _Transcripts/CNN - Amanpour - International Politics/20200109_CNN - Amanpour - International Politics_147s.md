Video Description: Iran's standing down â€“ those are the words of President Trump as he addressed the nation in the wake of Iranian attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq. The belief in the administration seems to be that Iran chose to send a message rather than take action that would have provoked a substantial U.S. military response. David Urban, a close confidant of the president, joins the show to explain Trump's thinking.

# What Was Trump Thinking? His Confidant Explains  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds)
*  I know that you are close to the president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=0.0s)]
*  you're close to many of his senior officials, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=2.2s)]
*  you are all at West Point together, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=4.44s)]
*  and you have a sort of camaraderie, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=6.24s)]
*  and you've been in touch with him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=8.2s)]
*  Can you walk us through, if you can, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=9.38s)]
*  the sort of thinking before President Trump [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=12.64s)]
*  made his statement, which the world is taking now, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=16.38s)]
*  as calming tensions, as not furthering [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=19.22s)]
*  a tit-for-tat military escalation for now? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=22.98s)]
*  Are we reading it correctly, and how did he come to this? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=25.36s)]
*  Yeah, Christiane, I think you're exactly correct. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=29.26s)]
*  I think this administration, this president, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=31.16s)]
*  in previous interactions with Iraq, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=34.7s)]
*  had exercised a great deal of restraint [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=38.74s)]
*  on numerous occasions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=44.54s)]
*  You mean with Iran, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=45.58s)]
*  Yeah, with Iran, I'm sorry, excuse me, yes, with Iran. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=47.52s)]
*  In terms of, you know, we had the attacks [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=49.86s)]
*  on the oil tankers, you had the attacks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=52.92s)]
*  on the Saudi oil fields, and then most notably, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=55.660000000000004s)]
*  a direct attack on a US drone by the Iranians, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  and the president and the administration [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=62.28s)]
*  did not respond at all. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=64.32s)]
*  And so what I think, you know, you saw in this instance [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=65.56s)]
*  is the use of flexible deterrence, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=69.32s)]
*  You know, there was a direct attack, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=72.1s)]
*  a direct assault on the US embassy, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=76.06s)]
*  US sovereign soil by Iranian proxies, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=78.4s)]
*  and this president, unlike presidents in the past, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=84.38s)]
*  decided to say, no longer will the US allow Iran [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  to attack the US via proxies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=91.74s)]
*  Look, in 1983, the attack on the US Marine Corps barracks [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=94.08s)]
*  in Lebanon and on and on, the world and the US [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=99.94s)]
*  has turned a blind eye to Iran, you know, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  with the use of proxies, and this president has said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=106.82s)]
*  it's no longer gonna be the case. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  So I think today was an off-ramp for further escalation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=110.32s)]
*  I think it's a very positive thing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  I think that you will see, hopefully, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=117.82s)]
*  the world de-escalate, tensions kind of ease, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  and things get back to relative, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=127.05999999999999s)]
*  quote unquote normal there in the region. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=129.92s)]
*  Now the world's gonna knock it back. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFnSIkFoXds&t=131.96s)]
