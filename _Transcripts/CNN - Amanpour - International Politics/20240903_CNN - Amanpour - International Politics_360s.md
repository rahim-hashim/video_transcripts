Video Description: Ukraine is reeling from yet another deadly Russian missile attack. More than 50 are dead in a ballistic missile strike that targeted a military educational facility and a hospital in the central Ukrainian city of Poltava. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that so little time elapsed between the air raid alarm and the strike that people were caught as they tried to reach shelter. It's one of the deadliest single attacks on Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. The Ukrainian government said that both civilians and servicemen were among the casualties. Dmytro Kuleba is Ukraine's Foreign Minister. He joined Christiane in Kyiv right after news of the attack became public.

# Ukrainian Foreign Minister on Deadly Russian Missile Attack in Poltava  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c)
*  Dmitriy Kuleba is Ukraine's foreign minister, and we spoke right after news of the mass [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=0.0s)]
*  killing in Poltava broke. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=5.44s)]
*  At the time, the numbers were coming in, and the numbers he gave were still being counted. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=7.72s)]
*  Foreign Minister Kuleba, welcome to the program. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=14.72s)]
*  You have had an important meeting with the president and members of the war cabinet today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=17.32s)]
*  Poltava was attacked, and there have been scores of injured and dead. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=23.48s)]
*  Can you confirm to us what happened, what was targeted, what are the casualties? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=28.88s)]
*  Ballistic missiles, educational facility, the city of Poltava, a large city in Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=33.8s)]
*  I actually come myself from Poltava region, my father is from there, so this geography [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=40.88s)]
*  is very familiar to me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=46.96s)]
*  And we had a very detailed briefing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=49.32s)]
*  And the main takeaway, the main lesson that I want everyone again to hear about, and we [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=52.32s)]
*  will not get tired of reminding of it, this is just another reason why delivery of air [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=56.8s)]
*  defence systems to Ukraine must be expedited. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=64.24s)]
*  Do you think if you had had them there, this would have been intercepted? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=67.8s)]
*  Well ballistic missiles are very difficult to intercept, and Poltava is in the east of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=72.88s)]
*  Ukraine, so much closer to the Russian territory. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=76.96s)]
*  According to what I know, the time range for the ballistic missiles to reach the target [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  was very short, and the only way to intercept them was to have a Patriot system or SEMPT [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  air defence system, because they are the only one capable of intercepting ballistic missiles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how many more tragedies like this have to occur for all promises to be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  fulfilled, and for all new commitments to be made. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=109.4s)]
*  From what we understand, and I'd like you to confirm, the education facility was targeted [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=113.92s)]
*  as was a hospital. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  This is a defence education, a military education centre. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=121.12s)]
*  Can you tell us what are the number of casualties? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=125.28s)]
*  Well the most recent number that I heard was like 40, 40 dead, and more than 100 wounded. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=129.68s)]
*  But these numbers unfortunately are growing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=137.56s)]
*  We started the meeting in the morning with one number, and the meeting lasted for an [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=139.52s)]
*  hour and a half, and by the end of it the numbers increased. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=143.96s)]
*  In the last week it seems that this barrage from Russia against Ukraine has really stepped [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=148.38s)]
*  up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=155.08s)]
*  I mean there have just been a lot of attacks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=156.08s)]
*  Just this week alone, on Monday the first day of school, there was a lot of incoming [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  here in Kiev and elsewhere. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  To what do you attribute this, not sudden, but this noticeable increase? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  Winter is coming. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=173.57999999999998s)]
*  Putin still has the same purpose, to freeze people, to destroy our economy, and this is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=175.22s)]
*  his strategy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  So I'm afraid that he will continue with his barrage of missiles and drone attacks in the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  course of the autumn. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=191.1s)]
*  But I want to set one thing straight. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=193.5s)]
*  I don't want anyone to think that Ukraine is asking for air defence systems while sitting [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=196.34s)]
*  itself with hands down. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=201.82s)]
*  This is not the case. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=203.66s)]
*  We are doing more than we can to use our mobile groups, shooting intercepting drones, to efficiently [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=205.46s)]
*  use air defence systems available to us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=215.4s)]
*  So we are doing our part of the homework. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=218.78s)]
*  We are asking our partners to do their part of the homework, especially with regard to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=222.14s)]
*  those systems which were promised but have not delivered yet. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=226.54s)]
*  So obviously you're waiting for more deliveries, but you've also said the weapons that you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=230.78s)]
*  actually have, you need to be free to use them into its full capacity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=234.73999999999998s)]
*  The head of the EU foreign policy agrees with you, says otherwise these weapons are useless. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=239.92s)]
*  You said that you are fighting with your hands behind your backs. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  I know that you have sent a delegation to the United States, to the administration. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=250.14s)]
*  Where are you on trying to get these restrictions, and they're mostly from the United States, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=254.5s)]
*  lifted? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  Well my impression is that we are facing a last mile problem, and I reckon my mind on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=261.94s)]
*  how to cover that last mile. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  The decision, the capacity of Ukraine to strike military targets deep inside of Russia and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=272.7s)]
*  diminish the Russian capacity for air attacks on Ukraine, lays with the United States, United [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=280.8s)]
*  Kingdom, France and Germany. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=288.26s)]
*  These are the countries who are close to us, who are friendly to us, and they have necessary [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  missiles. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=295.14s)]
*  So they have to do two things basically. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=296.26s)]
*  First, to make a decision that allows us to strike these military airfields where strategic [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=298.5s)]
*  bombers take off carrying missiles and bombs, and second to provide us with the sufficient [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=304.94s)]
*  amount of those missiles. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=309.98s)]
*  This is not a rocket science, this is just a very banal issue of making the right decisions [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=312.3s)]
*  on time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=319.58s)]
*  So what would you say to them, because you constantly hear that the reason is escalation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=322.14s)]
*  They don't want escalation with Russia. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=326.94s)]
*  What else has to happen for everyone in the world to understand that the escalation argument [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=329.82s)]
*  is flawed, it never worked in the last two and a half years. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  It simply serves as an excuse not to do something. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB-edXjrE6c&t=339.94s)]
