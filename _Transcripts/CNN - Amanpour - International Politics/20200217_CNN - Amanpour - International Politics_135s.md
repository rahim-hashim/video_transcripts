*  And recently, I mean, you know, really recently in November around Thanksgiving, President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump told Fox News, why should we give money to a country that's known corrupt? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=4.48s)]
*  It's a very corrupt country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=10.24s)]

*  It's another problem. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=19.64s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=23.52s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=27.0s)]
*  When I had a meeting with Mr. President Trump, and he said about that, he said that previous [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=30.32s)]
*  years it was so corrupted country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=38.0s)]
*  Ukraine, I told him very honestly, and I was very open with him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=41.28s)]
*  I told him that we fight with corruption. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=46.32s)]
*  We fight with this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=49.3s)]
*  Fight each day. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=50.84s)]
*  But please, please stop to say that Ukraine is corrupted country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=51.84s)]
*  Because from now it's not true. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  We want to change this image. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3wND_1XxWg&t=61.44s)]
