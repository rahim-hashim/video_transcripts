Abbey Onn, an American Israeli living in Jerusalem, reports that five members of her family -- three of them children -- were kidnapped.

# Israeli Hostages' Final Message to Family: "This is a Holocaust" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM)
*  Abiyon is an American Israeli whose world fell apart over the weekend like so many others [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=0.0s)]
*  when she says five of her family members were kidnapped by Hamas and taken to Gaza. Three of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=5.28s)]
*  them are children 16 or younger and Abiyon is joining me now from Jerusalem. Firstly, Abiyon, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=10.24s)]
*  thank you for being with us. Tell me what actually happened having five members they must have all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=17.84s)]
*  been in the same place. How did they get taken and snatched? Thank you for having me. Everyone [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=25.52s)]
*  woke up to sirens on Saturday morning and we have a family whatsapp group and we began getting [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=35.28s)]
*  messages from our family in New Oz which is a kibbutz very close to the Gaza border [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  that Hamas was there and then we began getting photos and videos in general that there had [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=46.56s)]
*  been a massive infiltration of terrorists and we got messages from the family that they were in the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=51.92s)]
*  house and that they could hear gunfire and that they were afraid for their lives. They were actually [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=56.96s)]
*  in two different locations. It's a grandmother, three of her grandchildren and her son-in-law. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Noya is 13 and she's special needs. Carmela is 80. She's the matriarch of the family and elderly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  and we lost contact with them around 11 or 12. The last thing they wrote us is that this is a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=75.6s)]
*  holocaust and we're afraid we won't live and we know once the army took control of New Oz that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  the physical place of New Oz had been burned to the ground. The kibbutz is no longer and that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  almost half of the residents had been slaughtered in cold blood and that the people that they didn't [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  find had been taken hostage. Abbie, one of those appears to be, as you've just said, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=102.72s)]
*  a 12-year-old member of your family, Erez Calderon, because we have a video and I know you have wanted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=110.32s)]
*  us to show this video so that people can see what actually happened. Here is little 12-year-old Erez [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=116.56s)]
*  being manhandled as he appears to be taken captive. He's one of them, right? Tell me a little bit about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=123.52s)]
*  Erez. Look, I have a 12-year-old son in the other room and I think it's important for people to see [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=130.72s)]
*  this because it is a parent's worst nightmare. It is the worst thing imaginable to think that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=136.56s)]
*  a terrorist would put their hands on your child and to pull them and to push them and to take them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=141.44s)]
*  away from their home and their family. Erez is a 12-year-old like my son playing video games and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=146.72s)]
*  riding his bike and a brother to his sisters and a son to his parents and a grandchild and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=153.28s)]
*  a loved member of his family and this was a horrific, horrific act of terrorism against civilians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=160.0s)]
*  Abbie, have you had any support from, have your family been, you know, approached by the government, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=169.2s)]
*  the military, you know, officials? Are you getting any direction or any help as to what they might be [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=175.52s)]
*  doing, what might happen next? We're trying to do the best on our own right now to Carmela's, both [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=182.64s)]
*  American and French and we're working with both governments to try to put pressure where we can. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=189.36s)]
*  We're trying to speak to as much media and as many languages as we can. We're working with consulates [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=195.84s)]
*  to make sure that everything is identified and we're trying to follow whatever protocol but we [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  don't have more information than that video that Hamas posted. Abbie, can you just mention Carmela? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=204.96s)]
*  She's 80 years old, Carmela Dan. Yes. What is her history? You said that she's a survivor? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=213.36s)]
*  Her father was born in the United States and he moved to Israel almost a hundred years ago to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=223.44000000000003s)]
*  build the country. She was born on a kibbutz in the north and she fell in love with Uri who was [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=227.44000000000003s)]
*  from near Oz, his family was from near Oz from the beginning and they've been living there for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=232.8s)]
*  more than 60 years. She's the matriarch of the family and she is the happiest, funniest, most [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=237.2s)]
*  loving woman and she was deeply, deeply connected to this place, into this land, into her family [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  and she was an American and she also lived in France representing Israel so she's also a French [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=250.16s)]
*  citizen. This is an issue of global urgency. Yeah, indeed and the President of the United States is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=256.0s)]
*  expected to speak shortly. We will see if he mentions American hostages and other international [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=264.32s)]
*  hostages as well as the Israelis. Abbie Ahn, thank you very much indeed for joining us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QjrBJWLbAM&t=270.08s)]
