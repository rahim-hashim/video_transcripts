Video Description: Amid the threat of an Iranian attack on Israel, the Biden administration is scrambling to avert an escalation of violence, exerting diplomatic pressure on its allies in the Middle East and convening top White House advisers. Among them is National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who just days ago helped secure the release of three Americans held in Russia. Sullivan joins the show to reflect on the long road that led to the historic prisoner swap, his concerns for the future of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, and what the administration hopes to accomplish during its final months in office.

# EXCLUSIVE Jake Sullivan on Ceasefire Talks and Historic Prisoner Exchange  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g)
*  Well, now, in the face of a looming Iranian attack against Israel, the Biden administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=0.0s)]
*  is scrambling to avert an escalation of violence, carrying out a diplomatic press on its allies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=4.36s)]

*  Adviser Jake Sullivan, who just days ago helped secure the release of three Americans held [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=14.48s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=19.12s)]
*  He joins Walter Isaacson to reflect on the long road that led to the historic prisoner [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=20.32s)]
*  His concerns for the future of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and what the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=25.52s)]
*  administration hopes to accomplish during its final months in office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=30.36s)]
*  Thank you, Biana and Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=34.84s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=36.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=38.68s)]
*  About in early May, President Biden put out a ceasefire plan for Gaza and the Middle East. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=40.52s)]
*  And we thought we were there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=47.52s)]
*  We thought within a day or two of it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  Israel assassinated the top political leader of Hamas when he was visiting Tehran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=50.92s)]
*  And just yesterday, Hamas put in the mastermind of the October 7th attack as its new top political [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  leader. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=64.28s)]
*  Where do we stand on a ceasefire? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=65.28s)]
*  Is it still possible to get one in the next few days or weeks? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=66.28s)]
*  Well, it's still possible. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=69.72s)]
*  The elements are there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=71.4s)]
*  The framework is there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=72.68s)]
*  It's been proposed by President Biden, endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, accepted in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=74.16s)]
*  broad terms by both Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=79.12s)]
*  And so they really need to drive through the details to get to a conclusion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=82.0s)]
*  Now, George Mitchell, the special envoy who negotiated peace in Northern Ireland, once [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  said about these kinds of negotiations that there are a thousand days of failure and one [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=91.32s)]
*  day of success. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=95.68s)]
*  And that's especially true in the Middle East, where you see intervening events like what's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=97.4s)]
*  unfolded over the course of the past couple of weeks. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=102.0s)]
*  But the president's determined to get this done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  And he's determined to hold both sides' feet to the fire to get to a conclusion where we [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=107.44s)]
*  have a ceasefire and a hostage deal paving the way for the end of the war in Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=112.08s)]
*  That's what we're driving at. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=117.68s)]
*  Just yesterday, he spoke with both the president of Egypt and the emir of Qatar, the other [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=118.68s)]
*  two mediators on this ceasefire proposal, to try to set up an endgame where we can actually [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=124.08s)]
*  deliver this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=129.28s)]
*  But you had a national security meetings over the weekend in which you're trying to prepare [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=130.48s)]
*  for the possibility that Iran's proxies will do a retaliatory attack. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=135.76s)]
*  What are we doing to stop that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=142.04s)]
*  And can this thing be tamped down? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=143.44s)]
*  Well, as you know, the president has been huddling with his top national security team [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=145.28s)]
*  on a daily basis, including meetings in the Situation Room. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=150.28s)]
*  And what we are trying to do as the United States is to keep the situation spinning out [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=154.52s)]
*  into an all-out regional war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=160.12s)]
*  And that means, first, moving military assets on a defensive basis into the region to be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  able to help defend Israel against any attack that comes from Iran or its proxies. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=168.44s)]
*  Second, sending a clear message that any type of escalation on the part of Iran and its [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=174.0s)]
*  proxies risks a counter-escalation and a slide into war. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=180.76s)]
*  And third, trying to push for de-escalation, trying to push to lower the temperature in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=185.84s)]
*  the region, particularly by getting this ceasefire in place, which, if we got the ceasefire in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=191.76s)]
*  Gaza, could lead to a ceasefire in Lebanon and ultimately could lead to a larger diplomatic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=196.88s)]
*  effort to produce greater stability across the region. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=203.0s)]
*  I just heard you say that we're moving the military assets there to defend Israel in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=207.04s)]
*  case there's an attack from Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=211.56s)]
*  Explain what that means. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=213.88s)]
*  To what extent, if there's an attack from Iran on Israel, does the United States directly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=214.92s)]
*  defend Israel and get involved in the war? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, historically, we really haven't done that, because that hasn't been necessary. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=221.92s)]
*  President Biden, however, has taken unprecedented steps to put the U.S. military in a position [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=227.44s)]
*  to be able to directly defend Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=234.16s)]
*  We did this in April, when Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles and hundreds of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=236.24s)]
*  drones and cruise missiles at Israel all in one day. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. had ships that are mounted with interceptors with the ability to shoot down ballistic missiles [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=246.55999999999997s)]
*  coming towards Israel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=254.76s)]
*  The U.S. had planes in the air shooting down drones and cruise missiles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=256.52s)]
*  And we worked with other countries, both countries in the region and countries in Europe, in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=261.24s)]
*  a small coalition that in an unprecedented way defended Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=265.56s)]
*  We are in position and prepared to do that again should there be an attack on Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=269.84s)]
*  And we're sending a clear message to Israel's enemies that we're determined to defeat their [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=275.23999999999995s)]
*  attack. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=279.32s)]
*  Do you think that Israel had the right or justification to kill a political leader of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=280.32s)]
*  Hamas in Iran? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=286.0s)]
*  Well, I can't speak to any specific operation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  Israel has not spoken to any operation in Iran either. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=291.88s)]
*  What I can say in general is that Israel was attacked on October 7th by Hamas in the worst [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=296.0s)]
*  massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=303.12s)]
*  And I do believe Israel has a right to go after the authors of that massacre and to [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=306.32s)]
*  do so in a way that tries to protect and secure the people of Israel against future attacks. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  Because as you know, Walter, the leaders of Hamas have continued to say they want to do [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=317.0s)]
*  October 7th again and again and again. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=321.08s)]
*  Now, our goal, though, is not for an endless cycle of violence in the region. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=323.88s)]
*  It's not for escalation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=328.28s)]
*  It is for what President Biden has laid out and is continuing to work every day toward, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=330.12s)]
*  which is get a ceasefire in place, get the hostages home, get an end to the war, rebuild [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=334.28s)]
*  Gaza and ultimately try to generate a political horizon for the Palestinian people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=339.24s)]
*  Has the relationship between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu changed since [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=344.12s)]
*  October 7th? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=350.21999999999997s)]
*  And how is that evolution going? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=351.48s)]
*  Has Biden had to be much tougher on him? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  And can they keep that relationship together? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=356.88s)]
*  Look, President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu have known each other for decades through [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  ups and downs, through crises, difficulties, disagreements. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=364.44s)]
*  President Biden, as you know, has a deep conviction about the importance of supporting the state [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=368.64s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  He calls himself an Irish Catholic Zionist and believes that Israel is the home of the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  Jewish people, is something that must be protected. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=379.64s)]
*  And he'll work with anyone who is sitting in the prime minister's chair. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=382.56s)]
*  He's worked with every prime minister all the way back to gold in my year. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  And so he has engaged with Prime Minister Netanyahu since October 7th. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  He has supported him in Israel's darkest hour. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=394.52s)]
*  And he has challenged him on certain issues behind closed doors where Israel and the United [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=399.84s)]
*  States do not see eye to eye. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=404.68s)]
*  That's been true in the last 10 months. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  It's been true for the last several decades. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  So no, I don't see a fundamental change in the relationship. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=412.2s)]
*  I rather see the fact of this longstanding relationship play into President Biden's ability [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=415.04s)]
*  to be totally straight with Prime Minister Netanyahu when he needs to be. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=421.72s)]
*  And I get to bear witness to that in the Oval Office and when they're together, either in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=426.16s)]
*  Israel or the United States. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  But given the suffering in Gaza and now the potential food insecurity, perhaps starvation [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=433.36s)]
*  just in terms of humanitarian feelings, why isn't the United States able to do more to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=439.68s)]
*  get Israel aboard and do more on its own just to flood the zone with humanitarian relief, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=445.92s)]
*  even as this war is being prosecuted? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, Walter, I've said before that over the course of this war, the Palestinian people [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  have been going through hell, suffering under bombardment, suffering under deprivation of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=460.0s)]
*  various kinds that come with being in war. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=466.88s)]
*  And the suffering is immense and it is extremely painful. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=469.44s)]
*  And we have been working overtime to get more humanitarian assistance to flood the zone, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=474.24s)]
*  exactly as you say. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=479.92s)]
*  And actually, President Biden has made huge strides in this regard. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=481.04s)]
*  After October 7th, no gates were open to move trucks through to get food in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=485.52s)]
*  President Biden has gotten the Israelis to open multiple crossings. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  He's gotten the Israelis to accept the need for pauses, humanitarian pauses, so food can move [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=494.96s)]
*  around. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=500.08s)]
*  He's gotten the Israelis to change their policies for accepting food into the port of Israel so [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=500.88s)]
*  that it can get down to Gaza. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  And if you look at the amount of aid that is getting in now compared to what was getting [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=508.64s)]
*  in some months ago, it has gone up considerably. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  Is it enough? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  It's never enough. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=516.72s)]
*  Do all the types of aid that need to get in, medical, humanitarian and so forth, get in? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=522.72s)]
*  Every day, we're working this problem. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=523.36s)]
*  Every day, I'm working this problem. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=525.12s)]
*  But we do feel we've made considerable progress. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=527.2s)]
*  We have stared into the face of famine in northern Gaza and tried to surge enough food in to avert [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=530.16s)]
*  that famine. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=537.28s)]
*  We are still trying every day to avert famine in other parts of Gaza as well. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=538.24s)]
*  And we'll keep doing that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  But we do believe that tangible progress as a direct result of presidential intervention [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=543.76s)]
*  has been demonstrably shown. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=549.28s)]
*  We're not satisfied with that. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=550.96s)]
*  We need to see more. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=552.32s)]
*  But I think that President Biden actually does have quite a bit to show for his engagement [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=553.5200000000001s)]
*  with the prime minister. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=558.0s)]
*  You were in the thick of this huge prisoner exchange that happened between Russia, the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  United States and the Western world, called the biggest prisoner exchange since the Cold War. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=565.84s)]
*  But I look back at the Cold War. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=570.88s)]
*  I don't think we had one even as big during the Cold War. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=572.48s)]
*  It's probably since World War II. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  That's the biggest. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=576.72s)]
*  Tell me about, you know, you had Paul Wieland out. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=577.84s)]
*  You got Evan Gorsuch out and Vladimir Karamertsa. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=581.68s)]
*  It was a big deal. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=586.2399999999999s)]
*  One of the things that happened was it was stuck in place. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  And there's an old Dwight Eisenhower line about when a problem's unsolvable, make it [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=592.56s)]
*  bigger, enlarge it, try to do bigger. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  How did you end up doing that, which is enlarge the problem, thus solve it? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, it actually began before Evan Gorsuch, the Wall Street Journal reporter, was even [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=604.2399999999999s)]
*  taken prisoner in Russia. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=608.8s)]
*  It started when we were trying to get Paul Wieland out. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=611.1199999999999s)]
*  And the Russians were falsely accusing Paul Wieland of being a spy. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=613.92s)]
*  And they were saying, we will only exchange Paul Wieland for a spy, for an intelligence [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=617.68s)]
*  asset. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=623.3599999999999s)]
*  And in particular, they focused on this fellow in Germany, Krasikov, an FSB agent who had [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=623.76s)]
*  been convicted of murder. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=630.4s)]
*  Now, we, the United States, did not have the capacity to trade Krasikov to Russia for Paul [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=632.16s)]
*  Wieland or anyone else. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  He was in German custody. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=639.76s)]
*  Then when Paul Wieland, when Evan Gorsuch was taken, it became clear to us that the only [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=641.68s)]
*  way to get Paul and Evan out would be to put Krasikov in play. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=646.8s)]
*  But to get the Germans to take the bold step of putting Krasikov on the table, there needed [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=650.88s)]
*  to be something for the Germans to be able to show their own people that they were delivering, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=657.12s)]
*  consistent with German interests and German values. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=662.4s)]
*  And that's where the idea of adding political prisoners from Russia to the mix came into [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=665.2s)]
*  focus. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=670.6400000000001s)]
*  And we began working on that many months ago to basically create a trade that involved [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  Americans, Russian political prisoners, and Germans held hostage in Russia. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=677.0400000000001s)]
*  And when we put it all together, we also then had to add other countries as well to create [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  a full package that could result in the release of the American prisoners and the Russian [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=688.08s)]
*  prisoners last week. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=693.44s)]
*  The final steps of these negotiations occurred when President Biden was recovering from COVID [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=694.96s)]
*  and he was trying to weigh his options in the 2024 race. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=700.64s)]
*  And at the very end, according to the Wall Street Journal, he ended up having to call [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=704.96s)]
*  the leader of Slovenia. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  And it was just an hour before he ends up withdrawing from the race. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  That's an incredible tableau. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=716.48s)]
*  Tell me what it says about those negotiations and the man you've worked with for so long, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=718.64s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=723.84s)]
*  Well, what was kind of remarkable about this deal was the number of pieces that had to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  fall into place. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=730.24s)]
*  Norway, Poland, Germany, Turkey, and ultimately Slovenia. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  Slovenia was offering up two Russian spies to be returned to Russia as part of the overall [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=738.48s)]
*  deal. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=745.0400000000001s)]
*  It was the final piece of the puzzle that we were trying to put into place. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=745.6s)]
*  And I think that's a great example of how we can get agreement from Slovenia, not just [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=750.08s)]
*  to offer them up, but to do it by August 1st so that this could all happen simultaneously [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=755.92s)]
*  on a single day. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=761.76s)]
*  So on the weekend of July 20th and 21st, I was in Aspen. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=763.36s)]
*  I think you were there as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=767.28s)]
*  And I was in my hotel room when I received a call from our team saying, you need to call [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=768.8s)]
*  your counterpart, the Slovenian national security advisor. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=774.24s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to resolve the cases of these two Russian spies so that they can [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=777.12s)]
*  be sent to Turkey on August 1st. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=782.16s)]
*  I made that call. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=784.88s)]
*  We had a good, constructive conversation. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=785.8399999999999s)]
*  And then my counterpart said, you know, this ultimately lies with the prime minister. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=788.48s)]
*  The only way we can actually get this done is if the president and the prime minister [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=793.28s)]
*  have a conversation to lock it in. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=797.28s)]
*  So the next day, Sunday, July 21st, President Biden spoke with his Slovenian counterpart [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=799.92s)]
*  about noon. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=805.1999999999999s)]
*  They sealed the deal. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=807.28s)]
*  We saw that we had the pieces in place. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=808.9599999999999s)]
*  And three hours later, President Biden announced to the world he wasn't running for reelection. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=811.5999999999999s)]
*  This was actually his last official act before he went out to the country and the world to [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  declare that he was going to run through the tape of this term, but not seek a second term. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=821.68s)]
*  You were trying to get Alexei Navalny out, the Russian dissident, for a long time. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=827.04s)]
*  Do you regret or feel that the fact that these negotiations took so long meant that we were [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=832.08s)]
*  not able to get Navalny out? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=838.64s)]
*  Look, we'll never know. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=841.44s)]
*  And I think about that question a lot. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=842.8s)]
*  I think about the opposite, too. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=846.08s)]
*  Does the fact that he was in play in any way, did that fact have an impact on his death? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=848.24s)]
*  We don't know one way or the other, frankly. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=857.04s)]
*  So because of the opacity and the darkness of the Russian system and the brutality of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=859.68s)]
*  that system, all we could do through this period was drive as aggressively and relentlessly [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=865.28s)]
*  as we could to get to an endgame. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=872.0s)]
*  And the fact that we ultimately got to one, even after the tragic death of Navalny, even [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=874.24s)]
*  after many false starts, even after many months, is quite remarkable. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=879.68s)]
*  This deal should not have happened. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=884.24s)]
*  It should not have come together. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=886.72s)]
*  And yet somehow it did. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=888.48s)]
*  And I'm very proud of that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=890.08s)]
*  I think the president is very proud of that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=891.28s)]
*  And we're grateful to have the Americans home and so many Russian freedom fighters, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=893.6s)]
*  including Vladimir Karamara, free to continue their fight. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=898.24s)]
*  It was kind of personal, too. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=902.24s)]
*  I noticed that you teared up today. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=903.52s)]
*  Yeah, I tried to retract that at the podium after I did so, but I did. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=907.36s)]
*  And it's because I invested not just in the strategy and the statecraft of trying to get [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=912.8s)]
*  this done, but I invested in the families. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=921.76s)]
*  I met with them repeatedly over the course of months, the families of Paul Whelan and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=924.0s)]
*  Evan Gershkovich and also Kerma Shaver, the Radio Free Europe journalist who we also got out, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=929.28s)]
*  an American citizen. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=934.56s)]
*  And in fact, the day Navalny died, Evan Gershkovich's parents were in my office. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  And they looked at me and they said, does this mean that Evan is not coming home? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=942.64s)]
*  And I told them that I was determined that he would come home, that we would find a way. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=948.16s)]
*  And I said it with great confidence and conviction. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=955.1999999999999s)]
*  But in the back of my mind, I didn't know for sure. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=957.28s)]
*  And so it was moments like that over the course of this effort that, you know, you can't help. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=960.16s)]
*  There's a huge intellectual component to this, but there's an emotional component, too, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=967.8399999999999s)]
*  because these are human beings and this is a human endeavor. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=971.52s)]
*  And so on the day they were finally released, I have to concede I was, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=974.88s)]
*  yes, a bit emotional about it on behalf of the families, on behalf of the president, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=978.48s)]
*  who I feel really delivered this, and on behalf of having so many allies who were willing to step [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=984.0799999999999s)]
*  up for us, for the United States. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=989.52s)]
*  All of that converged in that moment at the podium. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=991.52s)]
*  During the weekend Situation Room meetings on the Middle East, Vice President Harris was there. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=995.4399999999999s)]
*  I know you can't talk about what she was doing precisely in those meetings, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1002.48s)]
*  but just in general, now that she's a nominee of the party, tell me, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  give me some examples of what she has done in foreign policy, in Situation Room, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1012.16s)]
*  some story about how she has focused things. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1017.04s)]
*  Well, I've got to sit in the Situation Room with Vice President Harris since day one of the Biden [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1020.96s)]
*  Harris administration. I've seen her in crises, including when Israel's been under attack, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1026.0s)]
*  when U.S. service members in the Middle East have been under attack, when Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1032.32s)]
*  I've seen her counsel the president. I've seen her ask incredibly penetrating questions of our [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1038.4s)]
*  military and intelligence community. And I've seen her propose strategic initiatives, especially [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1043.12s)]
*  when it comes to where we are on the diplomatic offense in the Indo-Pacific region. This has been [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1049.12s)]
*  an area she's been particularly focused on. She's traveled to the region repeatedly. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1054.32s)]
*  She's built relationships with those leaders. And even in the case of the hostage negotiations, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1059.92s)]
*  Vice President Harris had a critical meeting with Chancellor Schultz in Munich, Germany earlier [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1065.84s)]
*  this year to help move the ball forward. So much like Vice President Biden was a central national [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1070.24s)]
*  security player for President Obama, Vice President Harris has been a central national security player [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1076.72s)]
*  for President Biden and is the kind of person who now, after four years, has the experience, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1083.0400000000002s)]
*  the depth of knowledge, the engagement, and frankly just the good judgment to be able to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1090.5600000000002s)]
*  handle these hard issues extremely well. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1096.16s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1098.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP7g9NRun8g&t=1101.4s)]
