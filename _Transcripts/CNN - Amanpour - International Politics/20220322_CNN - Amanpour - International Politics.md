Video Description: The open source investigative organization known as Bellingcat gathers and verifies information from public data sources, finding things others often miss. You may recall their work in Syria, where they uncovered evidence of chemical weapon attacks by President Assad against his own people. Now the company is tirelessly working to track, verify and debunk information surrounding the war in Ukraine. Christo Grozev is the organizationâ€™s executive director and lead investigator on Russia.

# Christo Grozev Are Civilian Casualties A Strategy to Terrorize Ukrainians?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ)
*  Can you talk to me about the civilian targeting? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, the Russians are absolutely clear in everything they tell the world, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=4.0s)]
*  we do not target civilian infrastructure. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=7.0s)]
*  And yet we see before our eyes what's happened to Mariupol, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=10.0s)]
*  what civilian targets are hit in other cities, including in Kiev, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=13.0s)]
*  and, you know, the number of dead and wounded. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=17.0s)]
*  But there's a very sophisticated way that they have of saying, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=21.0s)]
*  well, this person is a fake and that person is a fake, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=26.0s)]
*  and it was all actors and it was all staged. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=28.0s)]
*  Can you get beyond that, given that there's not many independent journalists in Mariupol? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=31.0s)]
*  We try to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=37.0s)]
*  So far we've gathered more than 400 incidents of civilian harm, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=39.0s)]
*  of those about 10 percent, 40 of them representing Grieches, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=43.0s)]
*  civilian harm incidents which could have been prevented, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=47.0s)]
*  should have been prevented with new care and compliance with military rules of engagement. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=50.0s)]
*  What we're seeing here is a neglect on the Russian side of the traditional military rules of engagement [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=55.0s)]
*  that are meant to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Every war will have collateral damage of civilian casualties. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=64.0s)]
*  What is particular here is that the Russian side does not make the effort. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=68.0s)]
*  And one may believe that actually it's part of their strategy to terrorize the population [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=71.0s)]
*  in order for pressure to build up on the government to come to some sort of a compromise with Kremlin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=77.0s)]
*  But what we see is not only evidence of targets that have zero military infrastructure importance, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=84.0s)]
*  such as schools, hospitals and theaters, as we have seen recently, administrative buildings, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=93.0s)]
*  but we also see some explanation for why that is happening. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=99.0s)]
*  There are a lot of intercepted phone calls that are being published by the Ukrainian security services, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=103.0s)]
*  and we were able to verify a small portion of that, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=109.0s)]
*  the ones where they publish also the phone numbers of the calling parties. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=111.0s)]
*  And we hear a lot of Russian officers and soldiers talking to their loved ones in Russia, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=115.0s)]
*  complaining about the plight that they're in, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=120.0s)]
*  and actually informing their wives, their spouses that they've been given instructions to ignore the duty of care to civilians, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=122.0s)]
*  to actually not even pay attention to whom they're shooting as long as somebody's in their line of view. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=130.0s)]
*  And this would explain also the total neglect for civilian casualties when artillery or other missile shelling is implemented. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL6A4otv9nQ&t=135.0s)]
