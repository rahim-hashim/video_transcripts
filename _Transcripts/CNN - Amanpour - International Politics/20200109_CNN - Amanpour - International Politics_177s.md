# Iraqi Journalist Breaks Down Mid-East Tension | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw)
*  Do you see, does your region see a strategy emerging from the United States on Iran? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, this administration's been quite clear that it sees Iran's activities in the region, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=8.64s)]
*  Iran's proxies in the region as problematic, and that's a view shared by many Arab states, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=14.88s)]
*  not only the Gulf states, but other Arab states here. So this idea of Iran feeling that it can [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  have its proxies, militias, whether it's in Iraq and Lebanon and Syria, able to roam about freely. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=26.4s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani used to roam Iraq and Syria quite freely. The Iranian foreign minister clearly used [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  to say that on issues like Yemen and Iraq and Syria, he has no real role. It's all with the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=40.96s)]
*  military command in Iran and namely with Qassem Soleimani. And that's been problematic. The nuclear [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=47.2s)]
*  deal is spoken quite often about in Europe and the U.S., but really for people in the region here, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=54.0s)]
*  nuclear arms are definitely a concern, but so are proxies and this asymmetrical warfare [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=61.04s)]
*  that's really troubled the region for a couple of decades now. And so from that point of view, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=66.56s)]
*  while the Trump administration has certain issues and problems that people are concerned about, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=72.0s)]
*  in reality, the fact that they raised the Iranian interference, if not proxy wars that are going on [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=76.64s)]
*  in the region, is something that quite a few Arabs agree with. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=82.88s)]
*  Clearly also we know that your leadership in the UAE, also in Saudi Arabia, have been calling on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=87.52s)]
*  for de-escalation for all sorts of reasons. They don't want to see another war on their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  doorsteps or on their coastlines. What do you make of President Trump's reaction today [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=97.92s)]
*  and of Iran's retaliation? They seem to have come to a sort of a de facto agreement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=104.8s)]
*  that that's it for the moment at least. For this round, hopefully in terms of military escalation, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=112.8s)]
*  that's where it's come from. I'm originally from Iraq and for many Iraqis there's concern that this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=120.56s)]
*  war is playing out in Iraq and the attacks yesterday that happened, the Ain al-Assad air base is an [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=126.0s)]
*  Iraqi base. Yes, there are American troops there, there are foreign troops there, but it's an Iraqi [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=131.76s)]
*  air base. For the Gulf here, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, right, have been calling for de-escalation. Let's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=135.84s)]
*  not forget that there's quite strong evidence that Iran was behind the attack on Aramco, for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=141.12s)]
*  example, in September and that was a huge blow really for stability, regional stability, and yet [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  still Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other Arab countries said, let's calm down, let's not escalate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=153.04s)]
*  the situation because definitely one thing this region doesn't need is another war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=157.36s)]
*  you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edWuEVcPCtw&t=171.12s)]
