Video Description: Tonight, an extremely difficult conversation in highly unusual circumstances. Siamak Namazi is an Iranian-American businessman who has been imprisoned in Iran for over seven years. He spoke today with Christiane over the phone from inside the notorious Evin Prison, giving us a firsthand look at the desperation of foreign nationals and dual citizens detained in Iran. Christiane first interviewed Namazi in the early 2000s during the reform era in what was then a very different Iran. Namazi was a prominent businessman and analyst, engaged in building relations between Iran and the West. Arrested during a 2015 business trip, he was convicted of cooperating with a hostile foreign government, a charge he denies. In the years since, American detainees have been released in prisoner swaps with the U.S., and Namazi's own father -- arrested in 2016 while trying to visit him -- was released on medical grounds last October. Siamak undertook a week-long hunger strike in January, and has written to President Biden asking for help. Nevertheless he continues to languish in prison. Now in desperation he has decided to come to us, hoping to convince the President to help him and other imprisoned Iranian-Americans.

Originally aired on March 9, 2023.

# EXCLUSIVE: An American Imprisoned in Iran Pleads For Help | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo)
*  Can I start by asking you to state your name [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=0.0s)]
*  and where you are actually talking to us from? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=3.2s)]
*  Well, my name is Siomak Nawazi, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=6.54s)]
*  and this call is being made [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=8.84s)]
*  from Ward 4 of Evin Prison in Tehran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Siomak, it's a long, long time since we last spoke [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=15.34s)]
*  when we met in Iran, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and I want to say that this is very, very unusual [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=20.0s)]
*  to speak to somebody inside Evin Prison. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=23.78s)]
*  Why are you speaking to us in this way? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=27.0s)]
*  Why are you speaking out now? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=29.48s)]
*  Well, Christiane, first, it's good to hear your voice [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=32.76s)]
*  as well after so many years, um, directly, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=35.66s)]
*  and not, um, not on the recording [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=38.56s)]
*  that someone's playing back for me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=41.02s)]
*  Um, I think the very fact that I've chosen to take this risk [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=43.16s)]
*  and appear on CNN from-from Evin Prison, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=47.36s)]
*  it should just tell you how dire my situation has become [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  by this point. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=54.88s)]
*  I've been a hostage for seven and a half years now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Um, that's six times the duration of the hostage crisis. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=61.36s)]
*  I keep getting told, um, that I'm going to be rescued, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=67.36s)]
*  um, and deals fall apart or I get left abandoned. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=71.56s)]
*  Um, honestly, the other hostages and I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=75.92s)]
*  desperately need President Biden to finally hear us out, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=80.42s)]
*  to finally hear our cry for help and bring us home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=85.0s)]
*  And I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  So this is a desperate measure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=92.84s)]
*  I, um, I'm clearly nervous. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=94.56s)]
*  Uh, just like it's odd for you, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  it's-it's very intimidating for me to do this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  Uh, I-I feel I need to be heard. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=103.44s)]
*  I-I don't know how-how long I-I have to wait [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  until the White House understands [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=110.54s)]
*  that we need action, um, and not just be told-to be told [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=113.4s)]
*  that bringing us out is a priority. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=117.94000000000001s)]
*  Uh, Siomak, let me follow up on that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  because you did write an op-ed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=122.94000000000001s)]
*  that was published in The New York Times in the summer... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=125.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=128.24s)]
*  ...in which you said that the Biden administration's approach [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=129.24s)]
*  to rescuing Americans in distress in Iran [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=132.34s)]
*  has failed spectacularly so far. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  And you've recently gone on a, I believe, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=138.44s)]
*  a one-week hunger strike to draw attention. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=140.82s)]
*  Tell me what you mean by failed spectacularly so far. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=143.42s)]
*  I mean, seven and a half years in, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=148.32s)]
*  and I'm still in Evian Prison. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=150.72s)]
*  Look, um, I believe that the U.S., [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=153.18s)]
*  uh, with all its power, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=157.52s)]
*  as the-as the superpower in the world, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=159.82s)]
*  has a great amount of leverage. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=162.28s)]
*  Um, and I believe that had that leverage been properly used, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=164.32s)]
*  we would have been out a long time ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=169.22s)]
*  I think what is clear, uh, is the following, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=171.88s)]
*  that the three of us, and what more than I, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=175.68s)]
*  are hostages in Iran. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=178.58s)]
*  We have not sold much as J-Walked. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=180.38s)]
*  We've been taken for one reason and one reason only, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=182.58s)]
*  and that's because we're U.S. citizens. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=186.02s)]
*  And the flip side of that is we've only released [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=189.12s)]
*  through a deal with the U.S. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  Um, you know, all I could do is repeat [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=195.12s)]
*  that seven and a half years is six times the hostage crisis. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=197.98s)]
*  Um, what-what is it gonna take? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=202.38s)]
*  Well, I'm going to-I'm going to try to ask you about that. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  You know, what is it gonna take? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=208.22s)]
*  But first, you are one of three Americans in Evian. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=209.82s)]
*  Uh, they are detained on-on so-called charges of espionage, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  but you are not. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=218.42s)]
*  You are detained and-and sentenced on other charges. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  Um, do you have any awareness or... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=223.38s)]
*  Sorry, I need to correct you on that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=225.88s)]
*  We all have the same charge. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=227.42s)]
*  We are all charged under Section 508, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=229.22s)]
*  which-which is a very nebulous charge, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=232.62s)]
*  uh, of cooperating with a hostile state, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=235.22s)]
*  in our case, referring to the United States of America. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=238.12s)]
*  Um, we-none of us have had access. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  I'll just speak to my-for myself, though. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=244.48s)]
*  But we don't-we're-we're ordinary citizens. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=246.48s)]
*  We don't have access to any classified information [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=248.82s)]
*  to give to anyone, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=251.12s)]
*  which is why we were charged with Section 508 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=252.68s)]
*  cooperating with a hostile state. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=256.48s)]
*  And, um, you're very free to ask details about that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=257.98s)]
*  Y-Yes, I-I want to know whether you are in the same location [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=262.48s)]
*  as the other Americans, Murad Tabaz and Ahmad Sharqi. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=267.32s)]
*  Yes, I currently am. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=272.12s)]
*  We haven't always been. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=273.58000000000004s)]
*  Um, all three of us, uh, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=274.82s)]
*  were at the same detention center at different times. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=277.62s)]
*  Obviously, I was taken, um, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  two years and two and a half years, respectively, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=285.08s)]
*  uh, before Murad and Ahmad. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=288.12s)]
*  But today, we're all in the same place. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=290.62s)]
*  And do you hope to all be released together? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=293.52s)]
*  Absolutely. I-I know what it feels like to be left behind, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=297.12s)]
*  and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  We're all in this together, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=303.88s)]
*  and I hope that this solution is found for all of us together. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  Siyamak, you wrote this letter to President Biden recently, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=310.58s)]
*  and I'm going to quote a little bit from it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  Day after day, I ignore the intense pain [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  that I always carry with me [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=319.62s)]
*  and do my best to fight this grave injustice. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  All I want, sir, is one minute of your day's time [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=324.62s)]
*  for the next seven days, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=327.86s)]
*  devoted to thinking about the tribulations [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=329.42s)]
*  of the U.S. hostages in Iran. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=331.72s)]
*  Did you get any personal response to that letter, Siyamak? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=335.26000000000005s)]
*  I've never had any response. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=339.32000000000005s)]
*  This is what makes things particularly painful. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=341.02000000000004s)]
*  President Biden has been in office for 25 months now. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=343.82000000000005s)]
*  You gotta excuse me. This is hard. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=348.86s)]
*  I know it's hard. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  It's hard to expose yourself to the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXLjM-Z_dHo&t=355.26000000000005s)]
