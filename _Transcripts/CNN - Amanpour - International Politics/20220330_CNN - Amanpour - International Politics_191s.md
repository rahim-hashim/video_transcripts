Video Description: Christiane is in Kyiv, where any hope of a diplomatic breakthrough is fading as Russia continues bombing Ukrainian cities. The Kremlin says it is ready to consider a meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, but world leaders remain skeptical about Russia's pledge to scale back military activity near the capital. In fact, Russian bombing attacks on Chernihiv and the outskirts of Kyiv continued throughout the night. Andriy Yermak, President Zelensky's chief of staff, joins the program to discuss Putin's endgame.
