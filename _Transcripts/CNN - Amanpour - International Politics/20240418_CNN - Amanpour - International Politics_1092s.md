# David Sanger on “New Cold Wars” and the Return of Superpower Conflict  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg)
*  And as such dark images emerge every day from Gaza, Ukraine and other disaster zones, it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=0.0s)]
*  can be difficult to find the light. Sometimes music can be a bomb and later in the program [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=6.04s)]
*  we bring you the ground-breaking Terence Blanchard, the first black composer at the Met. But first, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=10.96s)]
*  threats to the international world order. David Sanger is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=17.12s)]
*  and in his latest book, New Cold Wars, he explains America's volatile rivalry with two [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=22.26s)]
*  great powers, China and Russia, and tells Walter Isaacson how this happened and what [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  America got wrong after winning the old Cold War. Thank you, Kristjan. David Sanger, welcome to the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=32.38s)]
*  show. Great to be with you, Walter. Over the past weekend, Iran sent a whole fleet of drones and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=39.86s)]
*  missiles to Israel in retaliation for Israel's attack on its commanders. What is Biden doing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=49.26s)]
*  now to stop escalation? Well, first, let's start with the attack the Iranians ran itself. It was [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=59.14s)]
*  notable for two things. One was it was the first time since the Iranian Revolution we have seen a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  direct attack on Israel from Iranian territory. That lifts one of the big taboos that has existed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  for a long time, which is no exchange directly. And I think the biggest worry to come out of it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=78.46s)]
*  you know, fortunately, casualties were low. There was tragically one young girl who was injured by [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=83.22s)]
*  shrapnel, badly injured. But there were no deaths from this. But there was the death of a restraint. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=92.1s)]
*  And the restraint was the attack from one territory to another. The second big lesson that came out of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=98.74s)]
*  it was the Iranians are learning from the Ukraine War just as we are. They started with a swarm of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=108.34s)]
*  drones. They then had cruise missiles and ballistic missiles following up that could move much faster. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=114.9s)]
*  I think the Iranians have emerged from last weekend with a few important lessons that they need to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=122.26s)]
*  move their weapons closer to Israel if they're going to be effective. And they need to go invest [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=129.38s)]
*  heavily in hypersonics and faster weapons. And my fear, Walter, is that they may think from this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=134.34s)]
*  that if they can't get through the shield that the Israelis put up, they may have to invest more in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=142.26s)]
*  nuclear weapons and rev up the nuclear project. We have not seen evidence of that yet, but it [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=148.1s)]
*  would be too early. Well, you know, China and others helped us on that nuclear deal. What are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=153.46s)]
*  they doing now? And can we try to stop somehow Iran from getting a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  So it's a critical point because during the 2015 nuclear negotiations that were run during the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=165.78s)]
*  Obama administration, Russia and China sat on the same side of the negotiating table as the United [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=171.46s)]
*  States and the European Union. If those negotiations started up now, and I think there's almost no [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  chance that they would, you wouldn't see them sitting on that side. The Russians are now getting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=184.26s)]
*  their drones from Iran, China, Russia, Iran together, or forming a key part of what the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  Iranians call the axis of resistance. That's a big change in just nine years. And it's part of the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  dynamic of these new Cold Wars that I described. Well, wait, let's talk about this big change [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=203.06s)]
*  because it's huge. And the fact that all three of our major adversaries in the past 10 years have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=207.94000000000003s)]
*  joined forces, meaning Iran, Russia and China, any realist would have said, let's not let that happen. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=214.74s)]
*  Let's keep them from joining forces. Were we making a big mistake, especially pushing China [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=222.18s)]
*  into the arms of this axis of resistance to us? Well, I argue in the book, Walter, that we made a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=228.02s)]
*  fundamental mistake that goes back 30 years. We're making a good faith effort to try to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=235.3s)]
*  integrate China and Russia into the Western economy. And I argue that we spent 30 years [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=241.62s)]
*  diluting ourselves, some with bad intelligence, some with just wishful thinking, into believing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  that in the end of the day, China would not risk its economic future and its export market of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=254.9s)]
*  United States. Russia would not risk the revenues needed from oil and gas in order to pursue [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=263.14s)]
*  territorial gains or in order to crack down in ways that they knew would separate them from the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=269.86s)]
*  West. We fundamentally got that wrong for very different reasons in both countries. But we [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=277.94s)]
*  weren't listening to Putin when he said in Munich in 2007 that there were parts of the old Russian [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=283.14s)]
*  empire, meaning Peter the Great's empire, that needed to be restored. We didn't react fast enough [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=291.62s)]
*  when he annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine. And then the Germans, Chancellor Merkel signed the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=297.86s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 deal the next year, 2015, right after Crimea, which gave a new form of revenue [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=305.06s)]
*  to the Russians for gas exports. So what was Vladimir Putin supposed to conclude other than [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=312.26s)]
*  we would scream a lot about Ukraine if you want to take the entire country, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=318.82s)]
*  but that we wouldn't do much. And in China, we made parallel mistakes. Did we push them together? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=324.02s)]
*  I'm not sure we did, but it is clear that they are today doing what Nixon and Kissinger were [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=330.34s)]
*  trying to prevent in the mid-70s. So in the House of Representatives this week, you got Ukraine aid, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=336.5s)]
*  Israel, Taiwan, everything all bundled up in a mess. How is Biden trying to get this resolved [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=344.74s)]
*  with the House of Representatives? And what do you think could and should happen? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=351.94s)]
*  So the initial theory about how they were going to get aid for Israel and for Ukraine and for Taiwan [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=356.66s)]
*  and get some money for the border was put it all in one bill on the theory that there would be parts [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=365.78000000000003s)]
*  of it that everybody would hate, but that they'd all vote for it to get the part they wanted. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=372.42s)]
*  And now what you're seeing the speaker do is try to cut those apart and try to put together [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=378.82s)]
*  coalitions on each and every one of these, which is interesting, may work, but it requires him to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=386.1s)]
*  get everything right each time. Or you're going to get Israel aid and no Ukraine aid, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=395.94s)]
*  or Ukraine aid and no Taiwan, or whatever it's going to be. Actually, Taiwan's probably the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  easiest one of these three. On the left, the president's got to worry about progressives [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=408.42s)]
*  who want restrictions on aid to Israel. Although I think you can make a very reasonable case that we [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=417.14s)]
*  put restrictions on all kinds of aid, including telling the Ukrainians that they cannot fire US [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=423.14s)]
*  arms into Russia, for example. So it wouldn't be that big a stretch to say you cannot use American [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=430.5s)]
*  2000 pound bombs in a dense urban area like Gaza. In the hardest piece of this, it may well be [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=439.46s)]
*  Ukraine, where you've got a rump group of Republicans who basically want to send no aid at all. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=449.06s)]
*  They're finished with this. And there you just are in a philosophical difference about what [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=457.54s)]
*  it would, what message it would send to the world. If the US, after declaring to the Ukrainians, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=466.42s)]
*  we are with you for as long as it takes, suddenly changes the message to we were with you for two [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=473.62s)]
*  years, but now we've run out of money. We're reading this week a lot about the Russian [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=480.82s)]
*  disinformation campaigns and how long they've been authorized. It's something you've been reporting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  on for a long time. And I'm going to read something you read, you wrote about their online [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=492.18s)]
*  disinformation campaigns just recently. Russian operatives are laying the groundwork for what [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=499.38s)]
*  could be a strong push to support candidates who oppose aiding Ukraine or who call for pulling the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=504.5s)]
*  United States back from NATO. Has this effort by Russia impacted our politics and impacted the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=510.9s)]
*  politics in the Congress this week? It's really hard to tell, Walter, because the Russians are so [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=520.1s)]
*  much more sophisticated about this than they were in 2016. So what are they doing now? They are simply [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=526.82s)]
*  grabbing things that Americans themselves turn out, Americans with First Amendment rights, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=533.3000000000001s)]
*  and amplifying those and creating that echo chamber in the hope that by being more subtle about it, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=538.0200000000001s)]
*  all they are doing is amplifying the words of people who have First Amendment rights to have [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  their views, whether you agree with them or do not agree with them. It's a much more sophisticated [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=552.1s)]
*  and harder to catch kind of technique. And what I found really interesting as I was working on the [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=557.38s)]
*  book and having done a previous book on cyber is that the Chinese who had basically done a lot of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=564.4200000000001s)]
*  hacking but had never really been in serious information operations in the United States were [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=573.62s)]
*  beginning to replicate what they were learning from the Russians. And it will be interesting to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=579.78s)]
*  see what the combined effect of Russian and Chinese disinformation, misinformation, or just [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=586.02s)]
*  amplification could be. Your previous book on cyber and cyber warfare made it feel like in the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=594.42s)]
*  21st century, that's the way we're going to fight wars. What's stunning to me is the Ukraine War is [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=601.86s)]
*  fought the way it was 100 years ago. It's a World War I trench warfare. Why have there not been more [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=607.22s)]
*  cyber attacks in this case? Well, they have been, but they have been of a nature that's a little [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  harder to see. You know, when you're watching the war in Ukraine, what you see is the missile that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=618.6600000000001s)]
*  goes through the power plant. And the previous book, The Perfect Weapon, made the argument that cyber [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=625.0600000000001s)]
*  was a terrific short of war weapon because it's hard to attribute, it's hard to see, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=631.7800000000001s)]
*  and it's a way of taking something out of a country without going to full-scale war. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=637.1400000000001s)]
*  This has been the first time that we have seen a full-scale war between two very cyber savvy [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=641.94s)]
*  countries, Russia and Ukraine, where there was a significant cyber capability both on offense and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=649.5400000000001s)]
*  defense. And of course, the Russians, as I described in The Perfect Weapon, which is now [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=655.86s)]
*  from five years ago, used Ukraine as their testing ground for cyber. They did again. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=660.74s)]
*  And in the opening of the book, you see not only what the White House is seeing in the opening [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=666.9s)]
*  days of the war, but what Microsoft is seeing. And they send up a flare saying cyber attacks [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=671.62s)]
*  have begun on Ukrainian government agencies. And that makes its way up to Jake Sullivan, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=677.38s)]
*  the national security advisor, as a warning that the kinetic war was about to begin. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=682.74s)]
*  General Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said at one point in this colorful way, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  and I'll clean this up because he speaks army, but he said, you know, we thought at first this [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=694.34s)]
*  was going to be a pure cyber war. Then we thought it was a World War II tank war. And then we [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=699.94s)]
*  discovered it was a blanking World War I French warfare. And the answer is it's all three, Walter. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=705.22s)]
*  It's 1914. It is 1941. And it's 2022 to 2024. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=712.9s)]
*  Now, the big news this week is that President Biden is looking to put huge tariffs on Chinese [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=721.22s)]
*  steel. How does that fit in? That seems to push China even further towards the Russian-Iran [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=728.58s)]
*  axis. Why are we in this confrontation with China right now? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=736.58s)]
*  I'm not sure that the steel part of this fits his own China strategy. What he keeps saying is, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=742.4200000000001s)]
*  I don't want a Cold War with China. He said it at his UN speech his first year in office. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=751.38s)]
*  But he has never lifted a single tariff that Trump put on. And he has imposed some export controls [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  on China that are preventing China from getting the most sophisticated chips, particularly chips [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=768.58s)]
*  that would help them with artificial intelligence. That makes sense to create a bit of a time and [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=778.26s)]
*  gap for the U.S. to catch up. The steel terrorists, which he is describing, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=784.82s)]
*  seem to me to be more classic protectionism and an election year gambit. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=791.7s)]
*  And you're seeing that even with non-adversaries. The president has made it clear he doesn't want [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=798.02s)]
*  a Japanese firm to invest in U.S. steel. Well, there's no closer ally we have in the world [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=804.34s)]
*  than Japan. The prime minister was just getting a steak dinner the other day. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=810.9s)]
*  And so that's what happens when politics interferes, I think, with the good judgment of [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=815.62s)]
*  what makes sense and what does not. With this announcement of potential new tariffs on steel [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=821.86s)]
*  from China, it follows a theme in your book, which is that somehow or another the Biden [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=828.26s)]
*  administration is continuing a lot of the Trump administration's policies when it comes to China, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=833.78s)]
*  especially on protectionism. Is that right? They have certainly continued a number of the steps [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=839.78s)]
*  that President Trump took. And as I said, the sanctions are the most obvious among them. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=847.14s)]
*  I think they have wrapped it into a much more sophisticated and well-developed Indo-Pacific [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=853.78s)]
*  strategy in which they have brought Australia into the fold with a deal that will essentially [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=860.98s)]
*  allow the Australians to produce American and British designed nuclear submarines, not nuclear [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=867.62s)]
*  armed, but nuclear powered, and one in which they are bringing allies together who have not worked [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=873.38s)]
*  together before. Japan, South Korea, the Philippines. In Washington last week, we saw the first meeting [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=879.38s)]
*  between the Philippine leader and the Japanese prime minister with the Americans sort of guiding [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=885.7s)]
*  it along the way. And this is an effort to try to create closer to China's shores a grouping that [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=891.22s)]
*  is not quite a NATO, but is a made for purpose alliance to show a common front against Chinese [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=898.02s)]
*  expansionism. I think that makes sense in a way that the Trump policy never did. You'll remember [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=908.6600000000001s)]
*  Trump would cut any deal with China. He once told Xi Jinping, I'm not going to complain to you about [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=915.14s)]
*  what you do in Hong Kong cracking down on free expression, jailing dissidents, if it looks like [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=920.18s)]
*  we can get a trade deal. You're not hearing that from Joe Biden. But a lot of the techniques that [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=925.8599999999999s)]
*  Trump used, including tariffs, you're not seeing reversed. This book shows the real complexities [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=932.5s)]
*  and the dangers we now face, especially with three major adversaries aligned against us, US being [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=940.8199999999999s)]
*  against Russia, China and Iran. How does this end? How would you break out of this impasse? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=948.18s)]
*  Well, the first lesson of the book and its complexity is we're not in your old Cold War. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=955.54s)]
*  The old Cold War was a one on one contest between the United States and the Soviet Union, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=961.2199999999999s)]
*  and it was primarily a military and nuclear contest. This involves two major adversaries, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=966.5s)]
*  some minor ones or less capable ones, Iran included, but also North Korea, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=973.3s)]
*  and a number of countries that are sitting on the sidelines trying to make bets on both sides. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=978.74s)]
*  That's increasingly difficult to do. The other day, there was a fascinating investment that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=984.9799999999999s)]
*  Microsoft made in a company called G42 in the United Arab Emirates. While this looked like an [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=990.9799999999999s)]
*  effort by the United States to invest in AI in the Middle East, what it really was was an effort [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=998.42s)]
*  to try to box the Chinese out of the Middle East. That's the new territory. And it is now rather [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1003.9399999999999s)]
*  than it's, you know, whether there would be a domino theory of ideology spreading. The question [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  is who's going to control the key technologies of the coming decades. The only way I know to do that, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1016.02s)]
*  Walter, is to be both aggressive and thoughtful about how the US government helps marshal [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1022.82s)]
*  private enterprise to do this. This Microsoft deal was basically conceived of by the administration, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1030.66s)]
*  although the US is not formally a party to it. And you're going to need to see a lot more of that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1037.22s)]
*  I know there's an aversion to industrial policy, but the fact of the matter is that the world [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1043.22s)]
*  right now is a series of vacuums that one great power or another is going to fill. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1049.0600000000002s)]
*  And if you decide that we don't want the US involved in this, we just want to go build big [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1055.3000000000002s)]
*  walls and pull back, then what you're essentially saying is, I don't care who fills those vacuums. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1060.1000000000001s)]
*  And my guess is that's probably not a policy that over time is going to work out well. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1066.8200000000002s)]
*  David Sanger, as always, thank you for joining us. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1072.5s)]
*  Thank you, Walter. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxxn8qhtJmg&t=1075.54s)]
