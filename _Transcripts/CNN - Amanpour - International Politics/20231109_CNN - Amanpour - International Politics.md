*  Mr. Deraouche, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=34.7s)]
*  Great pleasure to be with you, Michel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=37.86s)]
*  And I'm so sorry about what brings us together. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=39.76s)]
*  I wanted to offer my condolences [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=42.0s)]
*  on the loss of your cousin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  Indeed, Awad. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=47.58s)]
*  Tell me about him. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=49.28s)]
*  Well, Awad was your average 23-year-old handsome young man, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=51.68s)]
*  full of life, full of energy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=58.52s)]
*  At age 16, Awad decided that he wants to be paramedic already, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=61.46s)]
*  and he started his life in the medical field [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=65.5s)]
*  very, very early. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=68.94s)]
*  He was the first person to volunteer [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=71.0s)]
*  to any activity in the community, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=73.38s)]
*  always smiling, lots of friends. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  And he went to study medicine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=79.38s)]
*  He went to medical school in the country of Georgia, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=83.08s)]
*  but then COVID hit, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=86.08s)]
*  so he had to come back, and he didn't want to waste his time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  He went straight to improve his skills as a paramedic [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=90.58s)]
*  and became also an ambulance driver and enjoyed it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=95.36s)]
*  And then he started thinking how to make his own company [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=99.02s)]
*  of ambulance services. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  So he was a very aspirational kid. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  He was at the music festival [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=109.24s)]
*  that we have now learned so much about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  because this is one of the big sites of the killings [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=113.66s)]
*  when Hamas attacked on October 7th. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=117.6s)]
*  Indeed, he was stationed there already from Thursday [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=120.94s)]
*  and doing basic medical services, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=124.84s)]
*  someone that scratches their legs, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=128.54s)]
*  someone that drinks too much. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=130.08s)]
*  Those are the things that he was expecting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=132.28s)]
*  and actually was treating. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=133.78s)]
*  He didn't expect this thing to happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=136.16s)]
*  He didn't expect the attack, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=138.12s)]
*  and it caught everyone by surprise, definitely him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  And he started treating the first casualties, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=144.24s)]
*  the first people that got wounded. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  The head of the team asked to evacuate immediately. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  He refused. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=155.36s)]
*  He said, no, I think I can manage because I speak Arabic. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=156.96s)]
*  And they started running away, begging him to leave. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  And he insisted to run from yet another injured person [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=165.06s)]
*  trying to close their bleeding wounds. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  That scene lasted for very short, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=174.84s)]
*  for maybe 30, 40 seconds, no longer than that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=177.24s)]
*  Because when they looked back at him [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=180.68s)]
*  and they were still screaming at him to leave, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=183.34s)]
*  and they saw him getting shot. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=186.64s)]
*  His teammates came later and shared the story of his bravery [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=188.78s)]
*  and how he was a selfless person [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=193.22s)]
*  that just wanted to be there to fulfill his human [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=198.02s)]
*  and medical duty. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=203.52s)]
*  To the end, I know that he would have treated [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=206.72s)]
*  any person on the scene. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=209.06s)]
*  I mean, that was the kind of human he was. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=211.0s)]
*  That was the kind of a professional he was. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=213.14s)]
*  He didn't ask the people treating what's their cultural [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=216.0s)]
*  identity, ethnic identity, religious identity. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=221.98s)]
*  What are their political perspectives? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  And he just kept running from one wounded person to another [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=228.56s)]
*  till he met his destiny. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=232.34s)]
*  How is your family doing? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=236.74s)]
*  Not easy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=239.64s)]
*  It was still a deep tragedy for us. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=243.68s)]
*  But because the war and the violence is continuing, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=248.08s)]
*  it's hard to overcome it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  It's hard to move on [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=255.46s)]
*  because we continue to see scenes of killing [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=258.02s)]
*  and it's part of the same story. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  So the story of his death keeps repeating itself for us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  We're not having really the space and time to say, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=270.44s)]
*  okay, we move on to the next event in our life. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=274.73999999999995s)]
*  The event is still rolling. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=279.78s)]
*  One of the reasons we found you is that you published [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=281.34s)]
*  an opinion piece in Haaretz where you talked about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=283.58s)]
*  what it has been like for Arab Israeli citizens [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=286.94s)]
*  or Israeli citizens of Arab descent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=290.24s)]
*  in the weeks since the attack. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=292.38s)]
*  I just want to say there are what? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=294.54s)]
*  2.1 million Israeli citizens of Arab descent [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=295.98s)]
*  and they are of different religions, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=300.68s)]
*  I mean, some people are Muslim, some people are Christian, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=304.06s)]
*  some people are Druze. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=306.92s)]
*  People speak Arabic, they speak Hebrew, they speak English. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=309.26s)]
*  And here's one of the things that you said. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=312.64s)]
*  You say, Arab citizens of Israel like myself [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  find ourselves in an extremely awkward position [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=318.46s)]
*  in times of war, but this war in particular [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=321.06s)]
*  has put us under unprecedented stress. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=323.56s)]
*  Could you say a bit more about that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I added one more interesting sentence [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=330.29999999999995s)]
*  that then I said that it's difficult to be [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=332.84s)]
*  when your country is at war with your people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=336.52s)]
*  And from one end, you want to be close to your countrymen [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=339.78s)]
*  and fellow countrymen. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=345.56s)]
*  The Israeli casualties, as I mentioned, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  the Israeli casualties, some of them are children [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=350.46s)]
*  and nephews of my friends, people that I associate with [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=354.0s)]
*  and I have them for dinner in my house. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=359.14s)]
*  And now I feel their pain. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=361.94s)]
*  And on the Palestinian side, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  we are not just Israelis from Arab descent, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=366.78s)]
*  we're also Palestinians. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=369.44s)]
*  We're Palestinians in our ethnic identity. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=371.0s)]
*  We did not immigrate to Israel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=374.0s)]
*  I always say Israel immigrated to us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=377.26s)]
*  We're the indigenous Palestinian population, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=379.54s)]
*  but we accepted the fate from 1948 [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=381.7s)]
*  that we live as a national minority in the state of Israel [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  as a separate, different ethnic group [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=389.46s)]
*  in the state of Israel. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=391.6s)]
*  So we know how to live in peace with Israeli Jews. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=392.96s)]
*  We then know how to live in war with them [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=396.8s)]
*  because in wartime, they relate to us [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=398.76s)]
*  as an extension of the enemy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=402.2s)]
*  They treat us as an extension of the enemy. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  We feel a great deal of witch hunting during this period [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  where we are silenced in a way that they prevent us from, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=412.54s)]
*  they try not to disallow us from expressing [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=416.7s)]
*  our compassionate feelings towards our Palestinian brethren. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=420.2s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we support Hamas [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=424.38s)]
*  and we support terror and we support the attacks on Israelis, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=426.18s)]
*  but we feel compassion to the Palestinian civilians [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=429.34s)]
*  that are paying such a heavy price. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  And that seems to be an illegitimate feeling [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=435.34s)]
*  in the Israeli public scene today. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  One of the things you also said is that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=440.41999999999996s)]
*  we have every right to feel safe in our own country [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=442.38s)]
*  and not live with fear in our workplaces [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  and on university campuses. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=446.64s)]
*  How is what you're talking about manifesting itself, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=449.46s)]
*  this fear that you're experiencing? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  It's already beyond fear. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=455.12s)]
*  It is manifesting itself in practical matters. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=456.24s)]
*  The Arab citizens have been arrested [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=459.54s)]
*  since the beginning of the war [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=461.82000000000005s)]
*  for placing some kind of a post on social media. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=464.02000000000004s)]
*  What's happening is that the police is trying to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=469.54s)]
*  create a culture of intimidation towards the Arab citizens [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  and then that's what we feel intimidated by this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=476.06s)]
*  We're not able to allow ourselves to express even a prayer. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=478.76000000000005s)]
*  It's impossible to even express it, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=483.5s)]
*  to put a prayer to say, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  we pray for the souls of our Palestinian, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=487.38s)]
*  for Palestinian civilians, women and children. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=491.06s)]
*  That would be seen as an illegitimate act [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=493.46s)]
*  that could get you for one or two nights in jail. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  There were chants against Arab students [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  in the city of Netanya to kick Arab students [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=502.26s)]
*  from the college there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  And the chants were death to the Arabs, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=507.82s)]
*  death to the Arabs and the kids had to be evacuated. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=510.34s)]
*  And they can't go back to their university today. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=514.42s)]
*  There are some universities that expelled Arab students [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=517.26s)]
*  and without even asking them to take for their opinion, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=520.2199999999999s)]
*  just the fact that they posted something on social media. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=524.06s)]
*  The worst part is that the minister of internal security, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=527.06s)]
*  who's a very well-known racist, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=531.66s)]
*  he's the minister of internal security. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=534.86s)]
*  He started arming Israeli Jews and we ask ourselves, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=537.02s)]
*  what is the situation facing in a personal weapon [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=542.02s)]
*  in the hands of Israeli Jews? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=545.1s)]
*  I see myself and potentially God forbid my children [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=547.14s)]
*  that would be on the other end of that weapon. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=551.02s)]
*  It is scary to be around Israeli Jews in Jewish sphere. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=553.86s)]
*  That's why my brothers do not go to work [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=557.98s)]
*  because they work in Jewish areas [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=560.86s)]
*  and they've been sitting at home and not working afraid. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=563.14s)]
*  Men and women that work in households, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=568.86s)]
*  whether it is cleaning or anything of that nature, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=571.74s)]
*  they're afraid of going to work. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=574.62s)]
*  A third of the medical industry in Israel are Arab citizens. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=576.34s)]
*  Seven Arab doctors have been kicked out of the hospitals. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=579.9000000000001s)]
*  Oh, despite the fact that they show up to their shifts [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  treating Israeli Jews as well as Arab citizens [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=587.38s)]
*  without any distinction, exactly what my cousin did. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=590.1400000000001s)]
*  They go and fulfill their civic professional duty [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=594.1400000000001s)]
*  and still they're supposed to be silent, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=597.5400000000001s)]
*  not having any compassion to their, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=599.94s)]
*  a other component of their identity. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=602.5s)]
*  Our civic identity is Israeli, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=605.5400000000001s)]
*  but our ethnic identity is Palestinian. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=608.1400000000001s)]
*  And we want to be able to at least feel that [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=610.7600000000001s)]
*  without having to be afraid of expressing it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=614.2s)]
*  What about where you live? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=616.9000000000001s)]
*  I think I'm making, I'm pronouncing it correctly, Iqsal. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=617.98s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=620.98s)]
*  And so you talk a little bit, if you would, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=621.82s)]
*  about your family's connection to Iqsal [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=624.86s)]
*  and how it plays into this story. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=627.46s)]
*  And then of course, I want to talk about your work. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=630.74s)]
*  I mean, part of your work, the work of your life [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=632.4200000000001s)]
*  has been to forge partnership among Arabs and Israelis [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  and Jewish people and people of other religions and so forth. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=640.9000000000001s)]
*  Well, we live just outside the city of Nazareth. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=644.3000000000001s)]
*  My family has lived in this town for almost 800 years. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=647.22s)]
*  And I'm here with my wife who's from East Jerusalem [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=652.74s)]
*  and our four children. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=655.62s)]
*  It's a community of about 15,000 people, all Muslim. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=658.5s)]
*  We feel we are in our homeland. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=662.86s)]
*  And the question is, are we in our state? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=664.74s)]
*  Is this country our country? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=667.38s)]
*  And we don't feel we lack a sense [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=669.26s)]
*  of belonging to the homeland. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=672.14s)]
*  We feel that the state is lacking sense [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=674.26s)]
*  of belonging to its citizens. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=676.3s)]
*  Israel defines itself as the state of the Jewish people, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=678.46s)]
*  not the state of its citizens. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=681.6s)]
*  They even passed a law called the Nation State Law [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=683.38s)]
*  that defines Israel as the state of the Jewish people, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=686.78s)]
*  not the state of the Israelis. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=689.74s)]
*  So in a way, I am in my homeland. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=691.52s)]
*  I am in my town. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=694.54s)]
*  I still see the same sunrise and sunset [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=696.74s)]
*  that my ancestors saw 500, 600, 800 years ago. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=699.58s)]
*  But the change is the political scene [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=704.54s)]
*  that is not seeing us as legitimate citizens, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=706.82s)]
*  as legitimate members of the state of Israel. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=710.46s)]
*  Regarding my work, and I've dedicated my life, Michelle, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=715.34s)]
*  to working with an organization called the Givat Habiba [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=718.58s)]
*  for the last 23 years. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=723.0600000000001s)]
*  And Givat Habiba is the first and by now, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=725.26s)]
*  still the biggest peace education center in the Middle East. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=729.7800000000001s)]
*  And almost 20 years ago, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=733.86s)]
*  we won the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=735.1s)]
*  because we know how to educate for peace. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=737.82s)]
*  And just simply, we bring Jewish and Arab youth together, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=739.98s)]
*  youth that have never met with each other, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=743.52s)]
*  give us two, three days. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=746.3000000000001s)]
*  We know how to bring down the rate of racism [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=747.4200000000001s)]
*  from an average of 65, 68% to 10 to 12%. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=750.7s)]
*  What we do is we get them on a path [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=755.38s)]
*  of humanization of each other. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=758.98s)]
*  We allow them to engage in dialogue also about differences [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=761.32s)]
*  so that it's an honest dialogue. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=764.3000000000001s)]
*  But we focus on interdependency. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=766.46s)]
*  The fact that we share the same buses, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=768.46s)]
*  the fact that we share the same universities, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=770.98s)]
*  the fact that we go to the same hospitals, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  we have the same economy, we have the same environment [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=775.32s)]
*  to try to connect people together. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=777.58s)]
*  We work on cross sector teachers programs. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=779.62s)]
*  We send our teachers to teach in Jewish schools, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=782.72s)]
*  Jewish teachers to teach in Arab schools. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=785.58s)]
*  In America, you tried the busing in the 60s. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=787.74s)]
*  In Israel, if we talk busing today, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=790.4200000000001s)]
*  they'll send me to a mental hospital. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=792.1800000000001s)]
*  So what we do is we bus teachers [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=794.3000000000001s)]
*  because we can't bus children. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=796.72s)]
*  It's very hard to bus children. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=799.12s)]
*  So we bus teachers and we almost cover 20% [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=800.76s)]
*  of the Arab educational system [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=804.48s)]
*  and 20% of the Jewish educational system. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=806.08s)]
*  93% of the cases, this is the first ever encounter [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  with the other. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=812.4000000000001s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying that there is an appetite [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=813.6s)]
*  for this kind of teaching and learning. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=816.36s)]
*  It sounds like there's an appetite among [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=820.08s)]
*  just the citizenry to do this kind of work. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=822.5200000000001s)]
*  Are you able to do that now? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=827.4s)]
*  During tense times, there's a rise in hatred. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=830.28s)]
*  There's a rise in polarization. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=833.0799999999999s)]
*  There's a rise in shying away from such activities. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=835.6s)]
*  But also as an institution, we learned that during time [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=839.8s)]
*  of war, you don't stay silent. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=843.4s)]
*  You go and still engage. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=845.04s)]
*  We are engaged as we talk right now. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=846.98s)]
*  Our teams are trying to minimize damage, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  trying to talk to mayors to tune down the damage, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=851.76s)]
*  to try to prevent a friction between their communities, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=855.64s)]
*  talk to the teachers that we have. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=859.16s)]
*  And out of the 2,500 teachers that I talked about, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=861.16s)]
*  almost 2,300 of them are actually still teaching [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=864.72s)]
*  as we speak right now. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  I think what is happening in the war [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=870.72s)]
*  is proving to us that our way is the way. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=873.16s)]
*  The fact that we're almost able to hold 90% of the work, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=876.16s)]
*  even at this time, tells you that there is still goodwill [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=879.32s)]
*  despite the anger, despite the frustration, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=885.2s)]
*  despite the easiness of going back [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=888.12s)]
*  to the stereotypical thinking of the other as the enemy [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  and I don't want to engage with them. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=894.2s)]
*  But at the end of the day, we ask the question, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=896.0s)]
*  well, what's the solution? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=898.08s)]
*  The problem is not the bottom up. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=899.5600000000001s)]
*  I think the problem is the top down. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=901.5200000000001s)]
*  The problem is the political leadership. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=903.2s)]
*  We have a failing leadership in both the Palestinian [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=905.1600000000001s)]
*  and the Israeli side that cannot deliver peace. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  I think that the public at the end of the day [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=910.5s)]
*  will be willing to engage in peace. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=912.56s)]
*  You know, a lot of people are trying to figure out [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=914.8s)]
*  where to be in this moment, you know, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=918.48s)]
*  where to plant their feet. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=921.28s)]
*  You are an educator. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  What would be constructive in this moment? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=923.64s)]
*  What would you want us to do? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=926.0s)]
*  You know, what I would say to the youth [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=929.12s)]
*  that come to the Givat Habib Center today [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=930.72s)]
*  is be a part of the solution, not part of the problem. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=933.16s)]
*  We, you know, everyone is now asked to take a side [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=937.84s)]
*  and I would say don't take sides. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  Take the side of the solution. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=944.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=946.32s)]
*  is an over-negotiated conflict [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=949.5200000000001s)]
*  with a need to go back to negotiations. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  We need to go back to implementing the solution, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=953.44s)]
*  which basically means that, in my view, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=956.44s)]
*  that the Palestinian and Israel leadership [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=959.5200000000001s)]
*  cannot deliver a solution. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=961.88s)]
*  We need global intervention. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=963.2800000000001s)]
*  We need the US government, the UN, God knows who else, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=965.48s)]
*  to come in and impose a political solution. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=969.16s)]
*  That's the two-state solution [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=972.48s)]
*  that's more or less around the 1967 borders. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  We cannot bring this from here. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=977.3199999999999s)]
*  We cannot deliver that result by our own capacity. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=979.0s)]
*  Someone with greater might and power [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=983.48s)]
*  needs to come and do that. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=986.3199999999999s)]
*  So if anyone can have any impact on that intervention, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=987.64s)]
*  that's where we need it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=994.0s)]
*  I see people demonstrating on the side of the Israelis [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=995.28s)]
*  and people demonstrating on the side of the Palestinians. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=999.84s)]
*  And I do connect with the pain on both sides, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1002.8s)]
*  but I think that's not where it should end. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1006.16s)]
*  We need to talk about the day after the war. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1010.08s)]
*  Hopefully the day after the war is tomorrow, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1013.28s)]
*  but it doesn't seem to be that close. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1015.8s)]
*  But the day after the war should be the beginning [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1018.04s)]
*  of implementation of a solution [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1020.36s)]
*  and not just dragging us for yet another 10 years of failure. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1022.72s)]
*  That promises the next October 7th clash. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  If we continue in the path of clash, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1034.28s)]
*  we're promising more and more casualties for both sides. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1038.04s)]
*  And I don't think it's in the interest of Palestinians [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1043.24s)]
*  and the Israelis just to have people siding behind them. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1046.76s)]
*  We need to stand behind the solution [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1049.8s)]
*  and not stand behind one party or behind the other [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1053.4s)]
*  or the other today because taking sides is not the solution, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1057.6s)]
*  but taking the side of the solution is the solution. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1062.04s)]
*  Mr. Mohamed Doraousha, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1065.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Michelle. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1069.64s)]
*  And hopefully we'll speak in better days. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1071.28s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-vNaAc4VGw&t=1073.84s)]
