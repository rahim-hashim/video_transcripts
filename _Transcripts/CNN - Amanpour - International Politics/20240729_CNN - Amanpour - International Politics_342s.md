# Fmr. Israeli PM on Weekend Rocket Strike and Rising Israel-Hezbollah Tensions  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY)
*  Well, Israeli leaders across the political spectrum are vowing to retaliate forcefully [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=0.0s)]
*  to this attack. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=4.4s)]
*  So the question is, what will that look like? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=5.4s)]
*  Let's bring in former prime minister and leader of right-wing party, the new right, Naftali [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=7.96s)]
*  Bennett. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=11.68s)]
*  He joins us now from Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=12.68s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you so much. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=13.68s)]
*  I don't know if you were able to hear the comments made to Ben Wideman from the Lebanese [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=15.36s)]
*  foreign minister. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=21.36s)]
*  If you were, I'm curious your response. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=22.56s)]
*  Well, first, I'd like to point out two corrections. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=25.880000000000003s)]
*  The first one is it's not Israel that's claiming that Hezbollah shot this rocket and murdered [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=30.0s)]
*  the 12 children. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=36.64s)]
*  That's a fact that's been confirmed also by the United States in an official memorandum [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=38.36s)]
*  confirming that this is a Hezbollah rocket made in Iran used by Hezbollah and they, Hezbollah [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=43.08s)]
*  and Nasrallah, murdered the 12 boys and girls. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Now, like any coward, he's trying to hide that and deny it, but that's a fact. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=54.68s)]
*  Secondly, the Golan Heights is no longer an occupied territory. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=59.64s)]
*  The United States of America recognized the Golan Heights as part and parcel of Israel, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=64.0s)]
*  so it's an integral part of Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=68.88s)]
*  As to your question, what we've had here is a war that has no premise, no basis for it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=72.36s)]
*  This is not a two-sided war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=82.16s)]
*  Hezbollah began attacking Israel on October 8th, has shot hundreds of rockets on Israeli [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=85.0s)]
*  kibbutzim in towns, killed dozens of Israelis, and now a couple of days ago, murdered 12 [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=92.08s)]
*  children. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=99.2s)]
*  So, when one says the word escalation, we are already at full-blown escalation that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=100.2s)]
*  has been produced by Lebanon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=107.72s)]
*  It is clear that such a severe attack cannot pass without a harsh response from the Israeli [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  Defense Forces, but a senior Israeli defense official is quoted as saying Israel wants [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=117.2s)]
*  to hurt Hezbollah, but does not want to drag the region into an all-out war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  In your view, what should that response then be, if the ultimate goal is reestablishing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=126.84s)]
*  deterrence but not a full-scale regional conflict or war? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=132.24s)]
*  Well, I beg to differ. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=138.28s)]
*  I think we are already at a full-scale regional war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  What do you call it when Houthis from Yemen shoot rockets and kill an Israeli in Tel Aviv? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=145.72s)]
*  When Iranian proxies in Gaza, Hamas and Islamabad, kill hundreds of Israelis? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  When Hezbollah is shooting hundreds of rockets? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=158.42s)]
*  When Iraqi militias and when Iran itself shoots hundreds of missiles from Iran onto Israel? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  So we are already facing a regional war. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=168.08s)]
*  The key is to identify the source of the enemy, and the source of the enemy is Iran. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=171.72s)]
*  The Islamic Republic of Iran is at the basis of all of this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=178.2s)]
*  It is sort of like the head of the octopus, and I have been advocating for a few years [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=182.72s)]
*  that we ultimately need to topple this regime for our sake, for the sake of the region, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=188.36s)]
*  for the sake of the Iranian people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=194.08s)]
*  I think now that's clear to everyone. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=196.0s)]
*  They are at the basis of everything. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=199.08s)]
*  Does that mean you're in favor of a full-scale war against not just Hezbollah? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=200.9s)]
*  And when I say war, obviously I mean of the scale that we saw in 2006, not what we've [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=206.12s)]
*  been seeing in the North since October 8th. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=211.48s)]
*  But you seem to be taking it one step further, saying Israel should go to war with Iran now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=215.28s)]
*  I'd say Israel is already at war with Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=220.8s)]
*  Iran has been shooting thousands of rockets through Gaza, through Lebanon, through Iraq, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  from Iran itself, from Yemen, on Israel, but they are not paying any price. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=231.32s)]
*  Now I'm not suggesting a specific action. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=238.12s)]
*  I'm not going to delineate precisely what we need to do, but we need to understand that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=241.12s)]
*  the head of the octopus of terror in the whole region, most of the terror in the Middle East, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=245.68s)]
*  its source is the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Those mullahs who have a very clear ideology, it's an incompetent and corrupt regime. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=255.96s)]
*  It will topple at some point, but I think America and Israel and the West need to accelerate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=262.56s)]
*  that, especially economic sanctions, but not only. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=268.84s)]
*  You said over the weekend on CNN, quote, what we saw happen on Saturday is the result of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=273.0s)]
*  a feeble week policy of many words and speeches, but not enough action. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=278.08s)]
*  The only way to stop this and deter our enemies is to fight back. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=282.26s)]
*  So in a sense, aside from Hezbollah, are you also pointing the finger of blame at the current [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=285.06s)]
*  Israeli government? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's no secret. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  I think Israel has lost a lot of its deterrents due to poor leadership. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  I think that's clear to everyone. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=302.06s)]
*  When something is not working well, you ultimately look for the leadership. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=304.62s)]
*  We're going to have to fix that as well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=308.94s)]
*  Right now, we stand united on the goal of fighting and ultimately weakening and toppling [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  the octopus of terror, the head of the octopus, which is Iran. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=318.14s)]
*  This is not something that happens in hours or days, but it's something that needs to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=321.73999999999995s)]
*  begin happening. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2_JNXs1mY&t=325.38s)]
