# Who Are the Houthis and What Is Their Role in the Israel-Gaza Conflict?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0)
*  And as we mentioned earlier, the U.S. launched its fifth round of missile strikes against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=0.0s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=5.72s)]
*  Walter Isaacson digs into the roots of this crisis with Middle East expert Elizabeth Kendall. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=7.8s)]
*  They spoke just before the latest round of strikes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Chris John. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=16.2s)]
*  And Dr. Elizabeth Kendall, welcome to the show. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=17.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  It's great to be here, Walter. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. just conducted this week its third military operation against the Houthis, who [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=23.94s)]
*  control much of Yemen, including the capital, after a nine-year civil war. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=30.94s)]
*  The U.S. put the Houthis back on the designated terrorist organization list. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=35.34s)]
*  Who are the Houthis, and how did it come to this? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=42.58s)]
*  The Houthis are a group that emerged in the northwest of Yemen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=47.3s)]
*  So in that bottom corner of the Arabian Peninsula. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=52.78s)]
*  Now they take their name from their former leader Hussein al-Houthi, who was killed in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=56.34s)]
*  2004, and they're now controlled by his brother, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=61.18s)]
*  So they're a family group that rules the Houthis, but they're much more than just a tribe. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=66.3s)]
*  They're a religious, political and military grouping that now involves its religion in [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=71.62s)]
*  its politics. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=79.54s)]
*  For example, their political arm is called Ansar Allah, which means partisan supporters [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=80.86s)]
*  of God. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  And they have a brand of religion called Zaidism, which is a branch of Shi'i Islam. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=89.1s)]
*  And that's important because Shi'ism is, of course, the kind of Islam that's practiced [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=95.34s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=100.26s)]
*  Now we shouldn't think of them as just a small rebel group. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=101.86s)]
*  They actually control territory in which about two-thirds of Yemen's population lives, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=105.58s)]
*  and that's about 20 million people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=111.42s)]
*  So and they've been at war for the last nine years in a civil war and several years before [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=113.7s)]
*  that since 2004. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=118.98s)]
*  So they're quite a considerable adversary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=120.82s)]
*  They should not be underestimated. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=123.38s)]
*  Well, you say at the core it's because they're a Shi'a Islam group. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=125.02s)]
*  And the civil war in Yemen has been fought between Sunni forces and the Houthi Shi'a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=130.78s)]
*  forces. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=138.58s)]
*  Is that an oversimplistic divide that we in the West make between Sunni and Shi'a, or [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=140.22s)]
*  is that really at the core of what's happening both in the region and in Yemen? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=145.66s)]
*  It's certainly true to some extent to describe this as a sectarian war between Sunnis and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=151.86s)]
*  Shi'is. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=159.62s)]
*  It is a lot more complex than that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=161.46s)]
*  So on the one hand, we have the Houthis, who are backed by Shi'i Iran. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=162.46s)]
*  And on the other hand, we have the so-called internationally recognized government backed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=168.26s)]
*  by Saudi Arabia, which is Sunni, and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=173.94s)]
*  But ultimately, this conflict inside Yemen was domestically generated before sectarian [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=178.34s)]
*  concerns came to the fore. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  It's about control of power, territory, and resources. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=187.78s)]
*  And it's simply that those sectarian narratives have been glued onto these much more fundamental [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=193.22s)]
*  struggles. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=198.9s)]
*  So it's going to have to be solved at that domestic level in very practical terms if [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=199.98s)]
*  that conflict is to go away. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=205.58s)]
*  Well, they're in the news right now because Yemen borders the Red Sea, and the Houthis [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=207.5s)]
*  have been using their arsenals of drones and military to attack shipping in the Red [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=213.78s)]
*  Sea. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=219.34s)]
*  And I think there are, what, 17,000 ships that go through the Red Sea every year. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=220.34s)]
*  I mean, one-fifth of the cargo coming to the East Coast of the United States is there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=225.14s)]
*  A lot of the oil goes through there. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=229.54s)]
*  Tell us what's happening with these attacks, and is that why the U.S. has been retaliating? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=232.74s)]
*  I think that the threat to global shipping and the knock-on effects that that has on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=239.3s)]
*  our economies has certainly focused the interests of the U.S., the U.K., and others in putting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=245.38000000000002s)]
*  a stop to this in a way that nine years of civil war and the Houthis trying to take over [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=251.9s)]
*  inside Yemen itself never would have gained our attention in this way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=257.94s)]
*  But let's just zoom out slightly. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=262.06s)]
*  The location of the Houthis down there in the Red Sea is really important because it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=264.9s)]
*  completes a jigsaw puzzle of Iranian proxies and partners in the region that, if you look [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=271.17999999999995s)]
*  at a map, surround Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=278.46s)]
*  So we've got the Houthis there to the south of Israel, and, of course, we have Hamas in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=280.67999999999995s)]
*  the west of Israel in the Gaza Strip, and then to the north we have Hezbollah, another [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  Iranian proxy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=291.17999999999995s)]
*  And then in the north and the northeast we have Iran-backed Shi'i militias. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=292.9s)]
*  So the Houthis are a really important part of completing that circle of pressure on Israel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  And are the Houthis officially aligned? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=305.82s)]
*  Do they work hand in glove with Hezbollah and Hamas? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  The Houthis are part of the so-called Axis of Resistance, which is controlled by Iran, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=313.06s)]
*  or at least partnered to Iran. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=321.82s)]
*  And I wouldn't say that they're very close to Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  It's simply that they have many of the same aims. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  And that goes for Iran, too. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=334.46s)]
*  The Houthi slogan is, Death to America, Death to Israel, a curse on the Jews, an infictory [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=336.18s)]
*  to Islam. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=341.42s)]
*  That chimes very strongly with Iran's own political slogans. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=342.62s)]
*  But it would be too much to say that Iran has direct command and control of the Houthis. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=347.26s)]
*  Iran's arms, its supply of weapons, its training and its intelligence have been incredibly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=354.42s)]
*  important in facilitating what the Houthis are doing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=360.38s)]
*  But it wouldn't be the case that if Iran suddenly stepped away or tried to stand the Houthis [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=364.21999999999997s)]
*  down, that this would end, because the Houthis have very good reasons of their own for continuing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  these attacks in the Red Sea. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=374.38s)]
*  But are there good reasons or reasons of their own? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=376.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, they have domestic reasons, regional reasons, international reasons. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=379.86s)]
*  At a domestic level, this is very opportune for the Houthis. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=387.26s)]
*  It enables them to position themselves as the defenders of Palestine, as the heroes [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  of the Palestinian people, at a time when there aren't very many political power bases, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=397.74s)]
*  regimes or governments speaking up for the Palestinians. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=404.58s)]
*  So that's made them quite popular, not just with their base, which is, by the way, very [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=407.58s)]
*  tired after almost a decade of war, but also more broadly in Yemen and the Arab world. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=411.9s)]
*  And then regionally, it works for the Houthis because they managed to gain more leverage [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=417.26s)]
*  over Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=423.02s)]
*  Saudi doesn't want to antagonize the Houthis at a time when it's trying to extract itself [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=424.62s)]
*  from a very awkward and expensive war that it's been pursuing against the Houthis in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=429.9s)]
*  Yemen, and it is on the cusp of being able to do that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=434.7s)]
*  And then finally, internationally, well, the Houthis have gained massive publicity for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=437.62s)]
*  themselves and for the Palestinians, and they've ensured that what might have seemed to us [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=442.3s)]
*  like a faraway problem in Israel is really brought into our attention zones by this attack [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=447.42s)]
*  on our global shipping and its knock-on effects, ultimately, on our wallets. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=454.1s)]
*  Well, I just read a really good article you wrote on all of this, and I think you mentioned [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=457.82s)]
*  that the Houthis were planning attacks on the Red Sea even before the October attack [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=463.54s)]
*  by Hamas on Israel. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=470.82s)]
*  So would this have happened without that, or is this really a reaction to what's happening [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=473.14s)]
*  in Gaza? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=478.65999999999997s)]
*  It's hard to say whether this was part of a well-planned strategy that Iran had in mind [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=481.02s)]
*  with its partners that was going to ramp up gradually, beginning with the 7th of October [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  attacks by Hamas on Israel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=496.41999999999996s)]
*  There are some signs that that might have been the case. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=498.7s)]
*  As you say, the Houthis were militarizing the Red Sea, a couple of islands, and bringing [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=501.34s)]
*  of weaponry that was required for these Red Sea attacks just before Hamas acted in October. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=507.94s)]
*  And what is very striking is that the different partners in Iran's so-called axis of resistance [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=515.58s)]
*  have gradually ramped up their activity in a way that makes them look like they're being [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=523.42s)]
*  reactive and proportionate, because they're responding to what Israel's been doing and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=529.62s)]
*  what America's now doing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=536.38s)]
*  It frames them not as the aggressors, but as the defenders. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=538.86s)]
*  So it could be part of rather a smart strategy, or it could simply be opportunistic. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=543.1s)]
*  As we said, the news right now is that in the past day or so, it's been decided to put [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=549.6600000000001s)]
*  the Houthis back on what is called, I think, the Specially Designated Terrorist Organization [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=555.62s)]
*  list. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=561.7s)]
*  That's what the Biden administration is doing. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=562.7s)]
*  I think in alliance with the United Kingdom. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=565.06s)]
*  What does that mean to put them on that list? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=569.5s)]
*  And why did the Biden administration take them off the list when Trump had them on a [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=571.62s)]
*  similar terrorist list? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=577.06s)]
*  So Trump did have them on that terrorist list, but we must remember that Trump only put them [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=579.78s)]
*  on that list a couple of days before he left office. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=585.5799999999999s)]
*  So it was almost like it was a gift to the Saudis as he parted from office. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=589.46s)]
*  Let me stop you there to explain why that would be a gift to the Saudis. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=594.7800000000001s)]
*  So, of course, the Saudis had been fighting the Houthis in a war since they entered the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  Yemen civil war in March 2015 and had been advocating for America to put them on that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=606.62s)]
*  terrorist list. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  And America had resisted that right up until Trump's last days in office. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=613.1s)]
*  And one of the reasons why the U.S. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=618.74s)]
*  had resisted is probably the advice of different humanitarian organizations, including the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=620.74s)]
*  United Nations, that this would be absolutely catastrophic for the population of Yemen, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=628.1s)]
*  which had already suffered greatly. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=634.22s)]
*  There was a situation, which is not much better now, where about 80 percent of the Yemeni [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=637.1s)]
*  population needs humanitarian assistance. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=644.0200000000001s)]
*  Now, if you designate the Houthis, then that makes it really hard for humanitarian organizations [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=647.78s)]
*  to get that vital aid and medicine in, because most of the population affected lives in the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=653.74s)]
*  Houthi areas. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=660.1s)]
*  So is it a good idea for them to be for the U.S. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=662.02s)]
*  and the U.K. to put them back on a terrorist list? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=664.78s)]
*  So it isn't a good idea. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=668.78s)]
*  It's not because the Houthis don't deserve to be on a terrorist list. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=671.3s)]
*  It's because of the knock-on effects of that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=675.78s)]
*  It doesn't hurt the Houthis. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=678.54s)]
*  For them, it's a badge of honor. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=679.94s)]
*  It hurts the general population who's already suffering. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=682.26s)]
*  And it also might have knock-on effects in scuppering the domestic peace process inside [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=685.78s)]
*  Yemen. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=693.0600000000001s)]
*  There has been an uneasy truce in Yemen since 2022. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=694.1s)]
*  It's not officially a truce, but it has more or less held. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=700.58s)]
*  And now the United Nations is just about brokering a political process for Yemenis to make peace [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=704.38s)]
*  with one another. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=713.26s)]
*  And the Houthis are a key part of that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=714.02s)]
*  Now, if the U.S. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=716.6999999999999s)]
*  places the Houthis on a terrorist organization, it's difficult to see how the United Nations [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=718.18s)]
*  can include them as a legitimate political authority in the domestic peace talks. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=723.9799999999999s)]
*  If those peace talks don't go ahead, then Yemen circles back into a civil war. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=734.46s)]
*  Well, it does seem that if they're part of the U.N.-designated peace process, that it's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=736.58s)]
*  the Houthis who've disrupted this by suddenly starting to attack international shipping [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=741.0200000000001s)]
*  in the Red Sea. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=746.0200000000001s)]
*  That is true. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=747.7800000000001s)]
*  But the Houthis are trying, and to some degree they're actually succeeding, in separating [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=749.14s)]
*  entirely what they're doing in the Red Sea from what's happening inside Yemen. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=756.54s)]
*  They're pitching their Red Sea attacks as something that is 100 percent geared towards [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=761.58s)]
*  bringing world attention to the plight of the Palestinians. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=768.26s)]
*  And they say that if Israel and America stop their aggression in Gaza and against Palestine, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=771.14s)]
*  then they will stop their attacks. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=777.9s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=779.34s)]
*  Do you believe that at all? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=780.58s)]
*  Well, I think we can't completely dismiss it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=782.86s)]
*  There's a genuine empathy and sympathy with the Palestinian courts, but we ought to also be [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=786.38s)]
*  skeptical. It works very well for the Houthis politically for all the reasons I outlined. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=793.5s)]
*  And I also think it's important to mention here that there's not that much evidence that the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=799.74s)]
*  Houthis are willing to settle for a power sharing agreement inside Yemen. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=804.7s)]
*  They're always flexing their muscles whenever they've signed an agreement before they've had [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=810.0200000000001s)]
*  deal remorse and they've always gone back to try to get more. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=816.0200000000001s)]
*  And so this could be just another example of that, where they have no intention of sharing power. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=819.26s)]
*  They simply want to keep finding excuses to carry on. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  What I should say is that I don't think they want all out war with the U.S. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=828.7800000000001s)]
*  That could be existential for them. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=832.62s)]
*  And I don't think they expect it because, like many people, like many commentators, nobody [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=834.8199999999999s)]
*  thinks the U.S. is going to put boots on the ground in Yemen. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=840.74s)]
*  And nor do the Houthis think that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=843.8599999999999s)]
*  But some kind of low level conflict, tit for tat strikes, that works well for them. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=845.54s)]
*  That feeds into their narratives. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=850.62s)]
*  Well, you just said that tit for tat strikes work well for the Houthis. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=852.74s)]
*  But the U.S. recently has gone through its third attack on the Houthis. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=858.78s)]
*  Is that helping or hurting the Houthis these last few weeks of U.S. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=864.1400000000001s)]
*  and allied military strikes on the Houthi forces? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=869.46s)]
*  Yes, an excellent question, because the rationale, of course, is that these strikes are [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  supposed to hurt the Houthis. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=879.5400000000001s)]
*  But there are several reasons why that's not really the case. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=881.2600000000001s)]
*  The first is that the Houthis are very adept at hiding their weapons. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=885.6600000000001s)]
*  They've also suffered many, many airstrikes, over 25,000 airstrikes during the course of the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=891.06s)]
*  civil war by the Saudi led coalition. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=897.82s)]
*  And they still kept going. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=899.94s)]
*  So it's very it's very likely that they can weather these airstrikes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=901.42s)]
*  And at the same time, they have been framing the United States as an aggressor, as an [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=904.9s)]
*  imperialist power that wants to be at war with Islam. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=910.9s)]
*  So these strikes now play to that narrative. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=914.18s)]
*  And whilst the Houthis can be relatively assured that the Americans won't want to go in with [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=918.34s)]
*  ground forces, they can just keep going because they have a different war logic from ours. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=923.74s)]
*  They're very tolerant of high casualties. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=930.66s)]
*  They are not that concerned about the cycles of misery that their actions inflict upon their [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=934.66s)]
*  populations. And they have war almost as a way of life because they've now been at war for [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=939.7s)]
*  almost the better part of 20 years with a couple of years off in between. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=947.38s)]
*  So they can just keep going. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=951.7399999999999s)]
*  I don't quite understand what could how this could possibly work out for the West or the U.S. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=953.9399999999999s)]
*  in the sense that the Saudis for what nine years have been trying very hard to push back the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=961.9799999999999s)]
*  Houthis to beat them. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=968.6199999999999s)]
*  The Saudis have used enormous numbers of missiles. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=970.9799999999999s)]
*  They're in the region and it hasn't worked at all. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=973.98s)]
*  Can the Houthis be defeated by a few random attacks by U.S. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=978.0200000000001s)]
*  drones when the Saudis couldn't do it? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=983.86s)]
*  No, I don't think they can. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=986.94s)]
*  You paint a very realistic picture. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=988.82s)]
*  We have tried all sorts of other measures. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=992.74s)]
*  Sanctions haven't worked. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=995.1800000000001s)]
*  Curbing the flow of funds to the Houthis hasn't worked. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=996.82s)]
*  Just putting the multinational maritime force in the Red Sea as a warning and a threat and a way of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=999.94s)]
*  batting away missiles. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1007.62s)]
*  That hasn't worked, which is why the U.S. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1008.7800000000001s)]
*  has now had to ramp up to this kind of direct military action. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1011.6600000000001s)]
*  Are there any other things that we could do? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1016.38s)]
*  Maybe maybe we could try harder with mediation. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1018.0600000000001s)]
*  Oman would be a good route because Oman has not joined the Saudi led coalition against the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1021.26s)]
*  Houthis and has open channels to both the Houthis and Iran. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1026.86s)]
*  And perhaps we could ramp up that indirect military action, things that the Houthis couldn't point to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1031.58s)]
*  the United States and say that was them and maybe also spend more time building up local forces in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1037.54s)]
*  Yemen who have spent the last nine years trying to push back against the Houthis. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1045.34s)]
*  Ultimately, though, I think it's quite hard to see any of this working without taking away this [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1050.86s)]
*  moral high ground that the Houthis have claimed rightly or wrongly, which is that they are [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1056.38s)]
*  defending Palestine. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1062.22s)]
*  So unless something is done to solve that overall conflict between Israel and Palestine, I think the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1063.74s)]
*  Houthis can just keep going. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1070.14s)]
*  Dr. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrDc4Itzo0&t=1072.7800000000002s)]
