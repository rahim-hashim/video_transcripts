# UN Secretary-General Calls for Global Ceasefire  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0)
*  Secretary General, in your speech, in your declaration, you have said, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=0.0s)]
*  it is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=3.52s)]
*  To the warring parties, I say, pull back from hostilities, put aside mistrust and animosity, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  silence the guns, stop the artillery, end the airstrikes. This is crucial. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Do you expect those countries to do so? Have you any hope? Have you discussed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=19.92s)]
*  face to face, but in diplomatic ways with the leaders of Syria, Iran, Libya, Yemen? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  We are already seeing in some of the scenarios the parties entering into dialogue to try to see how [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  they can cooperate in relation to the COVID-19. My hope is that this will be more generalized. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=41.04s)]
*  As I said, my special envoy will now be working hard in order to make sure that this ceasefire [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  appeal will be translated into effective diplomatic action in all areas. I hope that the G20 that will [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=56.4s)]
*  be met soon will also be able to address this issue. I hope the Security Council that will [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=64.64s)]
*  be meeting soon will also be able to address this issue. Just quickly, before I get on to the wider [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=70.56s)]
*  aspects that you've just mentioned, there's obviously great concern, not just in these [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=76.0s)]
*  countries with collapsing healthcare systems, obviously, under war, but also in the refugee [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=81.04s)]
*  camps where people are living cheek by jowl, often in hugely unsanitary conditions, outside, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=85.84s)]
*  completely unprotected, whether it's in Jordan, in Syria, in Greece, or wherever it might be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=92.48s)]
*  How concerned are you? Because we've heard refugee activists and organizations very worried. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=99.92s)]
*  Extremely concerned. This will be one of the central aspects of our humanitarian appeal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=107.68s)]
*  that we will launch on Wednesday of $2 billion to support dramatic humanitarian consequences of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  COVID-19 and response to the COVID-19 in those dramatic situations. And of course, UNHCR, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=118.4s)]
*  the UN Refugee Agency, and IOM are working together to put in place a plan of action [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=126.16s)]
*  that in very difficult circumstances, in very dramatic conditions, will do everything possible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=132.24s)]
*  to prevent the virus to come to refugee camps and other displaced populations settlements, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=138.4s)]
*  and at the same time to create the minimum of conditions to effectively fight the disease [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=145.68s)]
*  in those extremely difficult circumstances. Can you imagine Cox's Bazaar? One million people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=150.72s)]
*  in a very narrow area. Can you imagine Dadaab in Kenya? Can you imagine the situation [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=155.84s)]
*  in the Syrian refugees? So all this is indeed an enormous concern and will be central in our [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=162.16s)]
*  humanitarian appeal and in the mobilization of all our response capacities in humanitarian action. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=171.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxC63OCmwg0&t=185.84s)]
