# Fmr NATO Commander on Russia-Ukraine: "I Don't Think We've Seen Anything Yet" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M)
*  I fear that we will see increased civilian casualties, increased humanitarian catastrophe, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=0.0s)]
*  and ultimately potentially the leveling of cities. And I'm afraid to say that I don't [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=6.48s)]
*  think we've seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that's likely to happen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=12.48s)]
*  If you want to see what the Russians do when they when they destroy a city, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=15.76s)]
*  look at what happened to Aleppo. Look at what happened to Grozny. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=19.44s)]
*  So what does NATO then do? Because all sorts of unprecedented reaction has happened. The EU [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=22.8s)]
*  has not only the sanctions with the United States, which the Russians admit are hurting them, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=29.28s)]
*  but also for the first time purchasing and financing the purchase and delivery [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  of defensive weapons to the Ukrainians. Well, NATO and the wider Western world, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=38.72s)]
*  it's not just NATO, continue and ramp up the support of indirect support, logistics, weapons, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=43.6s)]
*  ammunition, military equipment and the like to help both help the Ukrainians. However, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=50.88s)]
*  it's got to be indirect. Any form of NATO active support will generate NATO at war with Russia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=58.08s)]
*  And NATO can only do that if NATO has really thought it through and assembled the sort of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=66.88s)]
*  force levels to be prepared to fight a general war with Russia. And do you think that is something [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  that's in the offing? I don't know. OK, let's not go there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=82.64s)]
*  I would like to know. I would like to say until NATO does do that, A, the eastern flank is not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=86.08s)]
*  going to be secure, i.e. NATO's eastern flank is not going to be secure. NATO needs to do it anyway [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=92.88s)]
*  in order to deter any form of incursion. Do you mean the sort of first Gulf War style coalition [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=98.88s)]
*  of hundreds of thousands of forces and tank brigades and artillery? It's a good analogy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=104.64s)]
*  It's that sort of size and scale of forces. From the Baltics all the way down? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=110.0s)]
*  Effectively, we're looking at a deterrent force. Assume the worst. Assume Putin takes Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=114.72s)]
*  Assume he hives off part of it and absorbs it into Russia in the east, and that's Gluhansk. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=123.28s)]
*  Assume the rest becomes a sort of puppet state dominated by Russia. We're looking at a new Cold [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=128.88s)]
*  War in Europe, which will require really significant deterrent forces from Estonia to Romania. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=134.72s)]
*  But as far as the immediate concern is forces concern, the absolute key is to, as I said when [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=141.52s)]
*  we last spoke, man the ramparts, by which I mean a similar force. This is old style stuff. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  This is not winning wars by drones and special forces and cyber. This is old style, heavy armored [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  divisions, as well as significant air. It's an air-land battle and it's a maritime battle. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=162.32s)]
*  But these are, this is going to require forces not seen on a scale in Europe since the peak of the Cold War. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uQJkyeY2M&t=169.2s)]
