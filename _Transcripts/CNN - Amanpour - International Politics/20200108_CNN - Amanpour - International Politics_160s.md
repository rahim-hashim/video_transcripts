# Former Obama Advisor on Iran: "We're in a Much Worse Place" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8)
*  Let me just ask you to give me your sense of where Iran and the United States are at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=0.0s)]
*  this moment, given this apparent end to the current tit-for-tat military cycle. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=7.12s)]
*  Well, Kristian, what is encouraging is that there does seem to be on both sides a desire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=14.08s)]
*  to de-escalate, and we see that through the comments from Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=21.0s)]
*  minister, and to some extent, at least, the comments from President Trump this morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=26.32s)]
*  So that's a good thing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=30.4s)]
*  And I'm also very thankful that no Americans were killed in the missile attack on our bases [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=31.4s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=36.16s)]
*  But when I step back and look at where we are versus where we were a week ago before [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=37.16s)]
*  all of this, I think that from the perspective of American interests, we're in a much worse [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=41.96s)]
*  place, and this has been a real strategic setback. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=45.8s)]
*  If you think about our core interests first, that Iran not get a nuclear weapon, well, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=48.92s)]
*  As a result of the president tearing up the nuclear agreement and accelerated by the events [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=53.56s)]
*  of the last week, Iran now considers all restraints that it negotiated off, and it can pursue [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=58.6s)]
*  the program that we stopped, we meaning Obama-Biden administration. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  Second, we have a profound interest in continuing to stamp out ISIL or Daesh and what remains [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=67.56s)]
*  of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=72.56s)]
*  And yet now the forces that we have in place to do that, a small number but very critical, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=73.56s)]
*  in Iraq and in Syria, are busy protecting themselves instead of prosecuting the mission [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=77.48s)]
*  against ISIL. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  That means ISIL will have a window, an opportunity, to regenerate, and all the more so if we're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=83.14s)]
*  actually forced to leave Iraq. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  We want to make sure that Americans are safe or safer. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  The administration said the action against Soleimani made them safer. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=92.66s)]
*  In the very next breath, it told Americans to leave Iraq, and embassies throughout the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  region have warned American citizens that danger is now increased for them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=100.24s)]
*  We have a profound interest in making sure that we're focused on the big strategic challenges [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  we face in an adversary, Russia, and a strategic competitor, China. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=109.72s)]
*  Well, both of them are thrilled at the prospect of us getting re-embroiled in a conflict in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=114.0s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And by the way, the president has talked about ending forever wars, which would be a good [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=124.16s)]
*  He's now increased our troop presence in the region by 18,000 in recent months. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=125.16s)]
*  And so if you step back and look at all of those interests, we're in a worse place than [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=130.4s)]
*  we were before all of this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=134.66s)]
*  And it goes back, in my judgment at least, to the original sin of the president tearing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=136.32s)]
*  up the Iran nuclear agreement that was working and unleashing a chain of events that have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=140.22s)]
*  brought us to today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF-ALUhPtW8&t=143.95999999999998s)]
