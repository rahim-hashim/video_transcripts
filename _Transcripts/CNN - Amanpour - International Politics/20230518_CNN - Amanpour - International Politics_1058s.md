# Fmr. Amb. to Ukraine Ukraine’s Counteroffensive Won’t End the War Yet  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [May 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k)
*  Now, returning to the war in Ukraine and the possibility of peace, as we were discussing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=0.0s)]
*  earlier, Marie Jovanovich served as the U.S. ambassador there after Moscow invaded Crimea. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=4.64s)]
*  She was removed from that post by President Trump, later testifying in his first impeachment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=11.84s)]
*  trial about the U.S. withholding aid from Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=17.04s)]
*  To discuss how this war can end and why the West must not repeat the mistakes of Crimea, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=20.54s)]
*  the former ambassador is joining Walter Isaacson now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=26.54s)]
*  Ambassador Marie Jovanovich, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=31.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  Man, it's been a busy week on the Ukraine front. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=36.019999999999996s)]
*  You were ambassador to Ukraine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=39.42s)]
*  We have a lot of movement, both diplomatic and with the start of the military offensive. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=41.54s)]
*  Let's start with the diplomatic ones. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=46.06s)]
*  The Chinese special envoys going to be wandering through the region, going to Russia and going [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=49.06s)]
*  to Ukraine for the first time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=54.14s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, our national security advisor, just met with his counterpart from China to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=56.46s)]
*  discuss possible things that could be done in Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=62.14s)]
*  As a diplomat, as somebody who once worked in the State Department, as a career Foreign [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=66.02s)]
*  Service officer, what do you make of all this diplomacy happening and what could it lead [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=69.98s)]
*  to? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=75.18s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very good sign. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=76.18s)]
*  I think, you know, Jaja is always better than war, war. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=78.78s)]
*  And so, you know, I welcome the fact that various parties are talking to each other. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=83.62s)]
*  China, obviously the country in the world that has the most influence, if any country [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=89.26s)]
*  does, over Russia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=94.66000000000001s)]
*  And so China could play, could play, we'll have to see, but could play a constructive [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=95.9s)]
*  role here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=100.94000000000001s)]
*  And I think the Chinese envoy is also going to countries in Europe, France and Germany [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=107.48s)]
*  So I think, you know, trying to get a sense of what is out there, what is possible. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=108.98s)]
*  The talks between Jake Sullivan and the Chinese last week that you mentioned sounded like [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=113.34s)]
*  they were pretty constructive as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  So let's see where we go from here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=122.14s)]
*  I would say, as a note of caution, though, that there's a time and a season, as it says, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  for everything. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=133.26s)]
*  And I'm not sure that the time for actual peace negotiations are at hand right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=134.26s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  Because I think both sides want to want facts on the ground that will strengthen them at [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=142.5s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=147.9s)]
*  That's certainly true for Ukraine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=149.22s)]
*  Ukraine wants to push Russia, you know, further, further back, hopefully all the way back so [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  that Ukraine can reclaim its territories. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=156.3s)]
*  Well, what do you mean by all the way back? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=158.74s)]
*  Do you mean all the way to, through Crimea as well? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=161.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=165.06s)]
*  I mean, Zelensky has been pretty explicit about that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=166.06s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=170.22s)]
*  And the Ukrainian people support that as well. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=171.22s)]
*  So we all know that in negotiations that this war will end, all wars end, and it will most [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=174.1s)]
*  likely end with, be followed by negotiations, as most wars do. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=180.78s)]
*  And the Ukrainian people have, usually there are compromises when there are negotiations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  But the Ukrainian people have been very explicit in poll after poll after poll that they want [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=192.94s)]
*  all their territory back. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  They want no concessions for Russia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=198.94s)]
*  Well, wait, I don't quite understand, Crimea, how that could possibly be won militarily [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=200.54s)]
*  in the foreseeable future. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that this is the view of the Ukrainian [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=208.46s)]
*  people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=214.82s)]
*  And Ukraine is a democracy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=215.82s)]
*  This is something that I think Vladimir Putin, of the many things that he doesn't understand [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=217.58s)]
*  about Ukraine, is that it is a democracy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=221.82s)]
*  And so while leaders may be ready to make compromises, including perhaps on Crimea at [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=225.5s)]
*  some point, they also need to bring the Ukrainian people along with them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=231.62s)]
*  That's going to be a critical factor and is going to be really, I think, challenging for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=236.1s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=242.66s)]
*  We've seen a whole lot of assurances of new weapons. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=243.66s)]
*  The Germans coming in with a very big package, the British coming in with the type of long-range [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=247.02s)]
*  missiles that even the U.S. was reluctant to supply. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=254.0s)]
*  So tell me, why was the U.S. reluctant to supply these missiles? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=258.24s)]
*  Will these long-range missiles from Britain help? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=261.76s)]
*  And will they put Ukraine in a better position to perhaps win? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=265.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's very significant. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=270.92s)]
*  The British have always been out front in terms of where they position their own military [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=274.0s)]
*  with regard to Ukraine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=279.88s)]
*  The kinds of systems that they've been providing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  And we have often followed suit, the most recent example being tanks to Ukraine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  We'll see whether this example of long-range missiles will provide that same kind of incentive [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=290.92s)]
*  for the U.S. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  But yeah, I think potentially it's, I don't want to say a game changer, but potentially [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  very significant because these missiles can reach very, very far and will force the Russian [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=304.92s)]
*  to pull back troops. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=312.36s)]
*  And so there's more of an offset. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=313.92s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=316.52s)]
*  You talk about a game changer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=317.52s)]
*  Well, I said I didn't want to call it a game changer after the words came out of my mouth. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=318.52s)]
*  But game changer is a double-edged thing, meaning it could really change the game if [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=325.52s)]
*  there are long-range missile attacks on the Russian homeland. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=331.24s)]
*  Do you think that could lead to tactical nuclear weapons being used by Putin? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't know what kind of caveats the British received or demanded from the Ukrainians. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=341.76s)]
*  So as you are well aware, when we have provided certain weapons systems, we have told the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=350.16s)]
*  Ukrainians that they can't use them on Russian territory. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=355.16s)]
*  And so again, I don't know whether the British asked for that or not. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that's a good idea when you, I mean, you even negotiated things like the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=364.48s)]
*  Javelin missiles, which are really just anti-tank missiles. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=368.8s)]
*  But did you feel it was a good idea to say you can't use weapons on Russian territory? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=372.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, it provides sanctuary for the Russians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=376.88000000000005s)]
*  You know, they can attack and then they can run back and hide. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=383.36s)]
*  And now the Ukrainians do have their own weapons, which they have very successfully used against [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  Russian forces, against Russian infrastructure and military objects. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  But you know, this idea of sanctuary in Russia really gives Russia an advantage. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=400.44s)]
*  What are your expectations for the counteroffensive that the Ukrainians seem ready to begin right [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=407.08s)]
*  now? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=412.2s)]
*  And how far do you think they could take it? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=413.44s)]
*  Well, you know, one thing that's been constant since the beginning of this war is that we [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  underestimate Ukraine and we underestimate the Ukrainian military. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  So I don't want to make that mistake because, you know, again, I just know the Ukrainian [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  people and I know the Ukrainian military from my time there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=432.12s)]
*  And I think that they could really move forward quite successfully. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=435.88s)]
*  You know, what we're seeing right now in Bakhmut, I mean, we're being told this is not the counteroffensive [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=442.44s)]
*  that we're anticipating, but what we're seeing in Bakhmut is some pretty sophisticated fighting [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  there and the Ukrainians are gaining on their Russian adversaries. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=453.56s)]
*  So I, you know, if that continues in the counteroffensive, I think they could be pushing the Russians [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  back quite a bit. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  And I hope that that's what will happen because it's important, the facts on the ground are [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=470.56s)]
*  important and they will strengthen Ukraine's hands in negotiations that we assume will [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=475.44s)]
*  come at some point in the future. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=480.56s)]
*  But the other thing I did want to say, Walter, is that whatever happens with this counteroffensive, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=482.88s)]
*  it's not going to be the end of the war, no matter how wildly successful the Ukrainians [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=488.92s)]
*  are. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=493.36s)]
*  And I think we shouldn't overestimate what is going to come because the war, I think, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=494.72s)]
*  will continue for some time. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=500.92s)]
*  I don't think Russia is ready to give up at this point and I wouldn't anticipate that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  they would be by the end of the summer either. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  So we need to understand that victories are a great thing and will build to ultimate success [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=511.68s)]
*  for Ukraine, but it will take time. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=518.76s)]
*  You talk about there being a time for war and a time for diplomacy and about facts on [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=521.74s)]
*  the ground and what the facts on the ground may be at the end of the summer after the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=526.12s)]
*  offensive. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=530.8s)]
*  When do you think that the facts on the ground or the timing would be right for everybody [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=532.92s)]
*  to say, okay, let's stop this, at least to have a permanent guaranteed ceasefire or perhaps [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  even a comprehensive peace? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=546.4s)]
*  It's hard to know, but I think it will take some time into the next calendar year even. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=549.04s)]
*  And I think we just need to be steadfast and continue to support the Ukrainians. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=555.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that as we look at what the contours of a comprehensive peace would be, because [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=560.36s)]
*  just to recall, back in 2014, 2015, the Germans and the French, the Russians and the Ukrainians, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=567.32s)]
*  they did come up with a ceasefire and the Minsk agreements, which were not successful. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=573.16s)]
*  The Russians never adhered to them. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=582.0s)]
*  There wasn't even an actual ceasefire, but it got us to take our eye off the ball. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=584.68s)]
*  And I think that's what the Russians are looking for, some temporary, certainly right now, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=590.68s)]
*  they're looking for some temporary ceasefire that they can use the time gained to regroup, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=595.68s)]
*  rearm, rest, and then come back when they assess that the West has moved on to the next [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=603.56s)]
*  shiny object. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=610.0s)]
*  And that could be years from now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=612.5999999999999s)]
*  If you consider that Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, 2015, and then re-invaded [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=614.76s)]
*  with this total war that we're seeing now in 2022, Russia is patient. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=621.76s)]
*  You've said that this war could go on indefinitely. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=627.36s)]
*  That would mean a change of mindset almost in the United States and in the West, which [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=632.12s)]
*  is not just providing weapons right now, but providing a very sustained war in Ukraine. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=637.08s)]
*  What do you fear about the politics in the United States as people start, especially [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=645.36s)]
*  on the left and the right, peeling off from wanting this war to continue? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=651.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=656.24s)]
*  I mean, you raise a really important issue. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=657.24s)]
*  And I think that what we need to do, what Zelensky needs to do, and I think he's doing [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=660.44s)]
*  that in his outreach in Europe last week and this week, and presumably he will at some [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=666.48s)]
*  point come to the U.S. again as well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  What Zelensky needs to do, I think what the Biden administration needs to do is communicate [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=674.36s)]
*  to publics, including the American public, what the stakes are, that this is a war about [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  Ukraine, but it is also about much, much more. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=684.6s)]
*  It is about our national security. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=688.36s)]
*  It's about global security. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=690.2s)]
*  Zelensky, when he was here in December, told Congress, you know, helping Ukraine isn't [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=691.84s)]
*  a charity, it's an investment in your national security. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=697.84s)]
*  And I think that's absolutely right. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=701.92s)]
*  And explaining to the American public why that is the case, that Putin, if he is successful [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=703.36s)]
*  in Ukraine, he will keep on going. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=709.96s)]
*  That's been his pattern since he took power, and he's told us this, and I think we need [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=712.16s)]
*  to believe him. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=716.14s)]
*  That will undermine, as it is undermining right now, the international rules-based order, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  where sovereignty is kind of the golden rule, where you don't invade other countries. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=723.36s)]
*  And Putin has, of course, violated that rule. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=731.04s)]
*  Well, aren't you sort of encouraged in some ways that he did that a year ago? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=736.36s)]
*  And it turned out it was a really bad idea for him, and he has been, you know, especially [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=743.4s)]
*  with Finland joining NATO. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=748.56s)]
*  Yeah, all sorts of unintended consequences, no question about it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=750.4399999999999s)]
*  And a reinvigorated NATO, you know, the West coming together is never before. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=754.4s)]
*  But you know, there are other, you know, other countries are not supportive. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=760.52s)]
*  They're waiting on the sidelines to see what's going to happen next. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=764.24s)]
*  And I think there are authoritarian states that are watching very keenly whether Russia [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=767.22s)]
*  will be successful, because if Russia is successful, then, you know, perhaps they can [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=773.24s)]
*  do the same things. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=778.16s)]
*  And if Russia is successful in Ukraine, Russia will certainly keep on going. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=779.16s)]
*  So I think the stakes are very, very high, and it will affect, you know, not only global [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=783.32s)]
*  security, it will affect the global economy, and it will affect our freedoms, because security [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=788.12s)]
*  and freedoms always go together. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  Your memoirs, which you published a year ago, are out in paperback this week, a new edition. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=796.48s)]
*  And you have a great Afterwards, which I loved reading last night. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=802.44s)]
*  But you talked about something that interested me, which was you call it Psiops, meaning [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  what does Putin do when he's threatening nuclear weapons, for example? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=811.44s)]
*  Explain why we have to be aware of that. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=817.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=820.0400000000001s)]
*  So when Putin talks about using nuclear weapons, I mean, obviously, we need to pay attention [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=821.4200000000001s)]
*  because you never want to get a nuclear weapons question wrong. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=828.96s)]
*  But he is trying to scare us. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=835.8s)]
*  He's trying to scare the Ukrainians, but mostly he's trying to scare the West and the United [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=838.32s)]
*  States, trying to intimidate us into not supporting Ukraine. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=842.84s)]
*  And here's what I would say. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=849.24s)]
*  If we fall for that, if we become intimidated, he'll do it again. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=850.76s)]
*  Other countries will, too. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=857.72s)]
*  They'll realize that they can intimidate the West just by the threat of nuclear warfare. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=858.96s)]
*  We need to stand for our principles. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=864.6s)]
*  We need to stand for our values. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=866.74s)]
*  We need to stand for our interests. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=868.52s)]
*  And I think one of the things that I've seen in Putin over time is that he's a bully, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=871.52s)]
*  and he's ahead of a big country, so he can push little countries around. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  But he understands force. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=882.3000000000001s)]
*  He understands strength. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=883.96s)]
*  And if we stand up to him, I think he'll understand that language. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=885.4399999999999s)]
*  And back in the fall, when there was a lot of loose talk about using nuclear weapons, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=889.3199999999999s)]
*  there were some behind-closed-door conversations, diplomatic conversations with the Russians [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=894.48s)]
*  as well as with other countries, that this was not a good idea. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=900.26s)]
*  Jake Sullivan said very publicly that it would be catastrophic for Russia if Russia used [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=904.4s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=909.22s)]
*  And while the talk hasn't completely abated, it has significantly died down. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=910.56s)]
*  And so I think that's an example of how Russia, the bully, has to be dealt with. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=915.4s)]
*  You say that this fight in Ukraine is part of something larger, which is why it's so [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=920.8s)]
*  important for us to pay attention. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=925.8399999999999s)]
*  And that larger thing is the fight against authoritarianism and breaking the rules of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=927.8s)]
*  international order versus the order that we've had for the past so many decades. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=933.72s)]
*  Tell me, are you worried that authoritarianism is on the rise here, or do you actually see [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=941.4s)]
*  some glimmers of hope that this spring we're seeing the pushback of some of these authoritarian [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=947.08s)]
*  regimes, including the success that the Ukrainians have had? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=953.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=957.64s)]
*  Well, just to neck down the question to Ukraine, I'm very optimistic about Ukraine, and I'm [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=959.56s)]
*  optimistic because of the people in Ukraine. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=964.68s)]
*  I first started working there 20 years ago, and there was no civil society to speak of. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=968.0s)]
*  People waited for leadership to tell them what to do. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=973.48s)]
*  That is emphatically not the case. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=977.1999999999999s)]
*  In Ukraine, every man, woman, and child is mobilized, and not mobilized because the leader, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=980.48s)]
*  Zelensky or a mayor has told them that they need to do something. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=987.52s)]
*  They look around and see what needs to be done, and they go and they do it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=991.0799999999999s)]
*  And so they are fighting for their families, for their country, for their future, and that [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=995.64s)]
*  future is a European future where the rule of law is supreme. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1005.28s)]
*  They've been trying to do this for many, many years, and I think this is the latest manifestation [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1011.56s)]
*  in the war against Russia. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1016.0s)]
*  And when, you know, finally, you know, we've been talking a lot about war and then the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1018.84s)]
*  peace. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1022.0400000000001s)]
*  But when that peace comes to Ukraine, I think it is going to be a European future because [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  the Ukrainians are not fighting for the country they had before that had so many challenges [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1028.56s)]
*  with corruption and rule of law issues. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1033.2s)]
*  They're fighting for the future. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1035.96s)]
*  Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1038.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8TB-ZSih9k&t=1042.32s)]
