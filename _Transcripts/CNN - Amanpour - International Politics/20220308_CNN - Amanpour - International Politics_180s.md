# Women's Significant Role in the Ukrainian Resistance | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o)
*  Tell me what role women are playing, because, you know, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=0.0s)]
*  we know that the Kurdish women brigades, for instance, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=3.24s)]
*  but we haven't really seen a lot of pictures of women soldiers, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=6.04s)]
*  but I understand there are. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=9.08s)]
*  It's a big percentage of the army. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=10.64s)]
*  Absolutely. Women are playing a role [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=12.24s)]
*  on every possible level of society in this resistance, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  starting with the armed forces, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=16.88s)]
*  and 22% or so of the armed forces are women at the moment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=18.56s)]
*  It's big. Yes, it is. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=21.56s)]
*  So, and the fighting force is about 12% women. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=22.96s)]
*  So it's really huge, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=26.96s)]
*  and more and more are joining the territorial defence as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=28.8s)]
*  And I'd like to highlight that, you know, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=31.44s)]
*  that we watch these pictures of territorial defence, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=32.88s)]
*  of civilians taking up arms, and, you know, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  a lot of us admire their effort and their desire to resist [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=37.72s)]
*  in every possible way, but really, it's heartbreaking for me [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=42.0s)]
*  to see civilians having to do that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=44.6s)]
*  It means that they feel that they are the only ones [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=46.28s)]
*  who will defend their own country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  They feel on their own, so they're desperate [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=50.8s)]
*  in their attempts to defend their country. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=53.6s)]
*  We also see defiance of unarmed women as well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=56.12s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure a lot of your viewers have already seen [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=60.92s)]
*  the images of a woman, unarmed woman, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=63.16s)]
*  approaching a soldier, a Russian soldier, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=65.24s)]
*  and offering him sunflower seeds and saying, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=67.24s)]
*  you know, put these in your pockets so that sunflowers, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=70.44s)]
*  the flower, for us, the flower of mourning and peace [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=74.12s)]
*  will grow out of your body when you die on our soil. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=77.0s)]
*  So there's resistance, powerful resistance with words, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  with weapons, with everything possible. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=82.92s)]
*  And the reason for that is because we know [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  what Russian occupation is like. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=87.28s)]
*  We've endured it for eight years in Crimea and in Donbass. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=88.92s)]
*  We've seen concentration camps formed out of, you know, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=92.92s)]
*  captured galleries. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  That was the case in Donetsk. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=97.92s)]
*  There's an art center called Isolation, as it happens, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=99.72s)]
*  Isolatia, which has been turned into a concentration camp [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=104.44s)]
*  where people chose to commit suicide [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  rather than endure the tortures that they are witnessing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=110.4s)]
*  We hear of numerous reports of... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Now or then? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=115.12s)]
*  Well, it's still there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  It was captured in 2014, and it's still in operation now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=118.28s)]
*  And the situation there is only getting worse and worse. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=121.88s)]
*  And of course, who is suffering first and foremost? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=124.64s)]
*  When we talk about wars, we usually think of trenches, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=127.36s)]
*  of battlefields, of the army and so on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=131.56s)]
*  But it engulfs the entire society, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=134.08s)]
*  And who is the least protected? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=137.04s)]
*  It's usually women with dependents. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=139.56s)]
*  We see this in Mariupol. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=142.16s)]
*  We see this in all of the besieged cities at the moment. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=143.4s)]
*  The people who are least protected are women [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=146.04s)]
*  who are looking after their children or the elderly or siblings [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=149.28s)]
*  and others who need protection. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=152.32s)]
*  At the moment, they're cut off completely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=153.68s)]
*  They have no water. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=155.08s)]
*  Your reports were covering that very clearly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=156.0s)]
*  They have no means of leaving. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=158.36s)]
*  They are being fired on as they're trying to escape. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=159.84s)]
*  There's a scorched-earth policy happening at the moment. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tenouqBnD-o&t=162.76s)]
