Video Description: Israel is all in on President Trump's proposal to clear out Gaza and take it over. Speaking on Fox News, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “remarkable idea,” even though there is no real blueprint from the U.S. about how it would work and who would pay for the rebuild. Many Palestinians in Gaza are saying, very clearly, that they are not going anywhere. Tom Fletcher is the United Nations' top humanitarian official and joins from inside Gaza.

# U.N. Relief Chief Reports From Gaza: Aid, Survival and Hopes to Rebuild | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ)
*  Tom Fletcher, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course, your first visit since the war began, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=2.96s)]
*  but also obviously you're there during the ceasefire. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=5.04s)]
*  Just in this in this in this sort of conundrum over what [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=8.28s)]
*  Gazans should do, where they should go. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=11.96s)]
*  What have you been hearing from them there? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=14.08s)]
*  Well, thank you, Christian, for having me on. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=18.88s)]
*  And I'm calling it as you say, from South Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=20.32s)]
*  I entered the areas crossing this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=23.0s)]
*  So I spent the day mainly in North Gaza, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=26.2s)]
*  which is desolate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=29.28s)]
*  And it's been it's been pummeled. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  As you drive along, you ask the people in the car, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=32.52s)]
*  you know, is that a school? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=35.52s)]
*  Is that a hospital? Is it a house? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=36.44s)]
*  And you can't tell the difference. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=38.84s)]
*  Miles and miles and miles. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=40.08s)]
*  And you see the people searching through the rubble. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=42.88s)]
*  They've been able to start going back to the north, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=45.2s)]
*  as we've seen in recent days. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And they're searching for their loved ones. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=49.84s)]
*  They're searching for family members. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=51.72s)]
*  And what you notice is the despair as they search through [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=53.44s)]
*  the remains of their homes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=57.52s)]
*  And you see the dogs as well on on the rubble. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  And what you notice is that the people searching are thin [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  and the dogs are fat because the dogs are also searching for corpses. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=66.2s)]
*  I mean, I really I've got chills as you say that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  Have you been able to? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=76.56s)]
*  Well, let me just play this soundbite from actually Carolyn Leavitt, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=78.72s)]
*  who, as you know, is the White House spokesman. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=82.68s)]
*  And, you know, she and others, including Trump, as we said, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=85.52s)]
*  and and and Witkoff, who's his envoy, they say Gaza is uninhabitable. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=89.44s)]
*  Here's the White House spokeswoman. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=94.36s)]
*  This is an unhabitable place for human beings. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=96.6s)]
*  Do you really think that that families can live their dream [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=100.32s)]
*  in a region that looks like this, with no running water, no electricity? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=104.44s)]
*  It's a demolition site right now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  It's not a livable place for any human being. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  And I think it's actually quite evil to suggest that people [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=112.44s)]
*  should live in such dire conditions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=114.92s)]
*  Look, apart from the irony that this is a, you know, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=117.2s)]
*  US backed war in in reaction to what happened in in in Israel [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=120.4s)]
*  on October 7th with US munitions. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=125.88s)]
*  What is your reaction to the fact that everybody's calling it a demolition site? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=129.52s)]
*  Can people live there? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=133.96s)]
*  Well, look, and just to be clear, before coming here, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=136.28s)]
*  I spent a morning in the arse with the kibbutz that was most hit on October [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=139.4s)]
*  7th and where one in four people were either killed or taken hostage. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=143.36s)]
*  And I spent a lot of time with the community there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=147.0s)]
*  talking to them about their situation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=149.12s)]
*  The community, by the way, that wants peace with the Palestinians [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=150.8s)]
*  and wants to rebuild their lives and they want to see the hostages come home [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  and the Palestinians living a clear, free life again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=158.0s)]
*  But no, when you when you drive through, one thing you do notice, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=162.4s)]
*  maybe a week and a half ago, there was more despair. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm hearing from my colleagues. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  The starvation levels were higher than, you know, since then, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  we've got 10000 trucks worth mainly of food in. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=172.68s)]
*  And so people are at least not starving anymore. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=176.56s)]
*  But what's happening is they're taking the tents that we're giving them [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  and they're going back to their homes and they're pitching those tents on the rubble. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=183.44s)]
*  I met one grandmother today who's in one room in the basement of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=188.32s)]
*  what's left of the house. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=192.68s)]
*  I mean, we couldn't go in there because it looked like what was left [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  would collapse at any moment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=197.0s)]
*  And she said, I'm staying here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=198.88s)]
*  You know, ask me where I want to go. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=200.44s)]
*  Ask me if I want this to be Riviera. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=202.32s)]
*  This is my home. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=204.44s)]
*  It was my parents' home and my grandparents' home. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  And we will rebuild. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=208.4s)]
*  And so I think what you're hearing today, which I hadn't expected, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=209.92s)]
*  is actually less of the hopelessness and despair that we were hearing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  a week or so ago and more of a defiance, not even an angry defiance, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  but just a sense that we're staying and this is our home and we're not going anywhere. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  I also heard some people being interviewed on the radio [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=227.92s)]
*  who, while they said they wanted to stay, they said that if rebuild doesn't start. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=231.16s)]
*  And of course, the Arab nations even yesterday came out and said [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=235.55999999999997s)]
*  they are committed to doing it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=238.6s)]
*  But while the Palestinians are still there, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  of course, it's a huge logistical drama and dilemma. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, then then we might have to we might have no no choice but to leave. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  But I want to ask you also because they said, yes, food is your as you're confirming, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  but they don't have electricity. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=257.32s)]
*  They don't have Internet reliable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=258.92s)]
*  They don't even have reliable fresh running water. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=261.56s)]
*  Plus, we hear that food in the market is still at extortionate prices. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=264.28s)]
*  What can you tell us about those basic necessities? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=268.92s)]
*  Well, the food prices are coming down now because we've got two weeks worth of bread [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  and flour and that's made a massive difference. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=277.04s)]
*  We've got food to a million people who are at risk of starvation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=279.24s)]
*  There's some commercial traffic coming in. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=283.52s)]
*  Fuel is very, very limited. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=286.04s)]
*  People are still cooking on on fires as they have been for 15 or 16 months in the rubble [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=287.44s)]
*  of their homes. We're getting a bit of medicine in. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=291.96s)]
*  I visited the one decent pump working in the north of Gaza, which we've helped to get [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=294.92s)]
*  started again, which thousands of people are coming miles in order to to use. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=300.84s)]
*  I met one old guy, you know, my father's age, mid 70s, who got there and he showed me his [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=306.4s)]
*  jerry can of water. He said all I have left in the world is this jerry can and this water. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=312.96s)]
*  But they are able to access some of that water. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=317.56s)]
*  The great need at the moment, Christian is tents. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=319.88s)]
*  That's what we're really focused on getting in, because as people try to return to their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  homes and as winter sets in, it's quite cold here today, very windy and very rainy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=327.32s)]
*  As winter conditions set in, we've got to get people back into shelter again. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=332.68s)]
*  So tents is the big need right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Cw672A3VQ&t=337.52s)]
