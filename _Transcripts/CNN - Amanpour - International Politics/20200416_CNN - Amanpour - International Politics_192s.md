# Iraq’s President Discusses COVID-19 Response  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0)
*  Tell us how you have been hit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, undeniably, this coronavirus is a serious challenge to everybody, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=6.0s)]
*  and Iraq is no exception. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=11.0s)]
*  Perhaps in the case of Iraq, it is even more of a challenge. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=13.0s)]
*  Our health infrastructure is not as developed as it should be. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=16.0s)]
*  However, we have mobilized with the help of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=20.0s)]
*  Our health authorities have mobilized early on and have imposed stringent measures, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=27.0s)]
*  including lockdowns, curfews, closing down borders, suspending air travels. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=32.0s)]
*  These, I hope, have helped delaying the curve or flattening the curve, and we are working hard. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=37.0s)]
*  We have to be very vigilant, remain vigilant, and not to be complacent about it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=45.0s)]
*  But the impact, obviously, in terms of the economy, in terms of the social dynamics, has been quite huge. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=52.0s)]
*  And the ramifications of this disease is yet to be fully, fully understood, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=62.0s)]
*  especially in countries like Iraq, because the challenges are huge. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=69.0s)]
*  But so far, I would say I'm very proud of our health sector and health workers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=72.0s)]
*  I met a number of them today, young people who are really battling this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=77.0s)]
*  And this is an opportunity to say to them and to health workers across the world a big thank you, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=82.0s)]
*  because they are truly heroes who are trying to save lives. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=87.0s)]
*  I met one doctor, a young doctor today, who was telling me that he has not been to see his family for almost a month now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=91.0s)]
*  I mean, it is these stories of courage that, you know, brings out the best of societies in these difficult challenging times. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=99.0s)]
*  President Barham Saleh, I mean, I remember very, very clearly after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=107.0s)]
*  those pictures where we saw everything being looted after the invasion, including the hospitals. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=116.0s)]
*  And we understand that, you know, with the years and decades of sanctions before that invasion, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=121.0s)]
*  and now with the difficult economy, as you say, you know, you really do have a stressed health care system. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=126.0s)]
*  What is your kind of nightmare scenario? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=133.0s)]
*  Because obviously you have this big outbreak in neighboring Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=136.0s)]
*  You have an outbreak in neighboring Turkey. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=139.0s)]
*  What do you fear might happen to Iraq? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=142.0s)]
*  Perhaps because of our concerns about the limited capabilities of our health infrastructure, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=147.0s)]
*  we have gone into higher mobilization to enforce the curfews and the lockdowns [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=155.0s)]
*  and the closing down of the borders and limiting the movements of people between various cities and provinces. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=161.0s)]
*  According to not just the Ministry of Health, according to the World Health Organization and others, these have been quite helpful. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=167.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8QQcJKiLQ0&t=177.0s)]
