# Jared Kushner: Middle East Peace Plan Makes Palestinian Lives "Much Better" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 31, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8)
*  You know, Benjamin Netanyahu paid you specifically great tribute [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=0.0s)]
*  and said that the state of Israel owes you a great debt of gratitude. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=4.0s)]
*  However, other Israelis, former negotiators, people who are also Israeli and Jewish patriots, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=8.3s)]
*  people who've been ministers in previous Israeli cabinets, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  have said today, at least one of them, Yossi Beilin, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=16.9s)]
*  this is not a deal for Israel. Why are we celebrating it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=19.8s)]
*  Maybe for one party in one segment of Israeli society. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=24.1s)]
*  But, he said, Trump has said, you can take it all, take whatever you want. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=28.2s)]
*  Jordan Valley, settlements, Jerusalem, take the lot of it, annex it all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=32.1s)]
*  This will give us, he said, one state where we will be the minority. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=37.1s)]
*  Answer that. Other people have said that today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=41.2s)]
*  Answer the idea of a two-state solution not being viable anymore. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=43.5s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to talk about these things [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=48.9s)]
*  because when we talk about, you know, random individuals who don't have a lot of say [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=51.7s)]
*  or maybe knowledge or who have tried and failed... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=55.4s)]
*  Jared, he was a negotiator and a former Israeli cabinet minister. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=57.7s)]
*  Okay, how did he do with his negotiations? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  This thing is as screwed up as it's ever been, Christian. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=64.3s)]
*  So, look, I've been getting criticized for the last couple of years [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=66.5s)]
*  by all the people who have tried and failed for not doing this the same way that they have. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=69.5s)]
*  We've put a real offer on the table today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=74.4s)]
*  We have a unified Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=76.4s)]
*  Getting both General Gantz and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the White House [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=77.7s)]
*  is a historic achievement. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  What I would encourage people to do is try to divorce yourself [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=83.5s)]
*  from all of the history that's happened over the years and read this plan, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=87.3s)]
*  look at the map and say two questions in mind. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=90.5s)]
*  Number one, does this make the lives of the Palestinian people much better? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=93.7s)]
*  The answer is unquestionably yes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=98.3s)]
*  The second question, does this compromise Israel's security [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=100.7s)]
*  or does this make Israel much more secure? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=103.9s)]
*  And the answer is unquestionably doing this deal makes Israel much more secure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=106.6s)]
*  Why? Why? Because it gives them a defensible territory. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=110.5s)]
*  It reduces tension in the region and it gives them the ability now, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  now that they've agreed to this, you're going to see them becoming less and less isolated internationally [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=117.0s)]
*  and you're going to see more and more pressure put on Palestinian leadership to do it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=121.4s)]
*  But we've done, look, right now, what's Palestinian leadership? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=125.2s)]
*  You're talking about them like they're great diplomats. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=127.5s)]
*  What are they calling for? They're calling for a day of rage. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=129.4s)]
*  Who do you know that runs a state that when they don't get what they want, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=132.3s)]
*  they call for a day of rage? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=135.0s)]
*  That's not how people who are capable of running a state work. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  So again, the Palestinian leadership have to ask themselves a question. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=139.5s)]
*  Do they want to have a state? Do they want to have a better life? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=142.8s)]
*  If they do, we have created a framework for them to have it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=145.5s)]
*  and we're going to treat them in a very respectful manner. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=148.3s)]
*  If they don't, then they're going to screw up another opportunity [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=150.8s)]
*  like they've screwed up every other opportunity that they've ever had in their existence. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVCLvDp6Fi8&t=153.5s)]
