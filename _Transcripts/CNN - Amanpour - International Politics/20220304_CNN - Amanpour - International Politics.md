# Russian Invasion of Ukraine “A New Iron Curtain Is Falling”  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA)
*  And our next guest says that President Biden must rally not only a divided America, but the whole [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=0.0s)]
*  world against Putin's aggression. Susan Glasser is a writer for The New Yorker, and she was Moscow [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=5.12s)]
*  bureau chief for The Washington Post. And she's joining Michelle Martin to discuss how the US [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=10.4s)]
*  president should respond to Putin's war. Thanks, Christiane. Susan Glasser, thank you so much for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=15.68s)]
*  joining us today. Thank you for being, for having me today. You have such a deep expertise in the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=21.76s)]
*  region and in the subject. But I want to start with the US perspective. Do you feel that the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=29.2s)]
*  strategy that the administration has laid out so far will be impactful? I mean, there's been an [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=34.96s)]
*  emphasis, of course, I think people know by now on economic sanctions. There's been a lot of certainly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=40.32s)]
*  tough rhetoric. There's been a lot of consultation with allies. And there's been the delivery of, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=45.44s)]
*  or at least the promise to deliver sort of lethal weaponry to Ukraine, however, they're going to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=50.56s)]
*  get it there at this point. But do you see these measures having an impact? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=55.6s)]
*  So, yes, first of all, a dramatic impact. Basically, what the US and its allies have done [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=62.08s)]
*  is to declare economic war on Russia. And we are seeing an extraordinary consequence of this. This [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  is the kind of thing that people in Washington, kind of policy watch that the Treasury Department [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=75.44s)]
*  have said for years, well, yeah, there's a lot of bigger things we could do, but that would cause [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=80.56s)]
*  catastrophic consequences in Russia. And that's why we haven't done them. And we're seeing that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=85.44s)]
*  this week. It is. Those are some big guns economically. And Putin has never really been [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=89.6s)]
*  someone who focuses on kind of economic tradecraft. And I think maybe even he is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=96.08s)]
*  stunned at the extent to which the United States and South basically cut Russia off from the world [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=100.96s)]
*  right now. So what effect will that have on Russian society in the short term? Clearly, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=107.28s)]
*  unfortunately, it's causing a new Iron Curtain to fall. Right. You know, it is an enormous [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=112.32s)]
*  amount of domestic repression at home is going to be Putin's response to this on the part of Biden, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  number one. I would say that, you know, where the concern is right now and where you see President [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  Biden, I think, trying to be a voice of restraint to a certain extent is there's this enormous risk [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=131.04s)]
*  that Putin escalates further, that the more he backs himself into a corner, in fact, his history [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=136.48s)]
*  and methods suggest that he may well escalate his desire, clearly stated, to reassemble [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=142.88s)]
*  pieces of the old Soviet empire. And so that's why you had President Biden from the beginning [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=150.56s)]
*  saying, we're not going to send U.S. troops to fight in this conflict, but we do not want World [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=155.84s)]
*  War III. You see a lot of resistance to calls for, say, a no-fly zone. And so to me, that is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=162.24s)]
*  kind of the most anxiety producing and uncertain thing is how much more escalation will you see [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=171.76s)]
*  from Western allies because people are so horrified, understandably, at what's happening. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  How do you read whether the administration really has support, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  bipartisan support for the moves that he's making here? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=189.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's an excellent question. I do believe there is strong bipartisan support [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  for Ukraine. And there has been, by the way, for a long time, even through the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=198.96s)]
*  previous Trump administration. And so the president has proposed a big new, I think 10 billion was the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  number being thrown around, aid package for Ukraine that would include both military and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian aid. I expect that there would be overwhelming bipartisan support in both the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=214.72s)]
*  House and the Senate once that does come to the floor, presumably pretty quickly. However, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  part of the public theatrics that you saw the other night at the State of the Union, I do think [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=225.6s)]
*  is misleading. The Republicans really are a bit panicky right now because in the lead-up to the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=231.44s)]
*  war, what you saw really was the emergence of a shockingly large pro-Putin wing of the Republican [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=237.44s)]
*  Party led by the former president himself, Donald Trump, who, as everybody knows at this point, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=244.0s)]
*  has been praising Vladimir Putin for years, sucking up to him, and concurrently adopting his view [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=250.24s)]
*  of Ukraine. I think that it's been forgotten in all the chaos and crazies, understandably, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=257.68s)]
*  in the last few years. But Donald Trump was impeached because he tried to blackmail the now [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=265.2s)]
*  international hero president, Vladimir Zelensky, literally by withholding the weapons that he [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=271.76s)]
*  needed to fight off this very kind of Russian invasion scenario. He called President Putin's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=278.0s)]
*  moves in Ukraine genius literally days before the missiles started flying. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=286.64s)]
*  And so the Republicans, seeing this enormous groundswell of support, are panicking over the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=292.32s)]
*  idea that the leader of their party, whom they refuse to disavow, has clearly got this big [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=297.68s)]
*  faction of people. So I think that's why you saw a real urgency on their part to make sure they were [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=303.44s)]
*  applauding that part of Biden's speech and standing up. We'll see when the dust settles from this [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=308.8s)]
*  horrible conflict how much of that pro-Putin faction exists or whether the war actually [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=315.04s)]
*  wipes that away. How impactful do you think was President Trump's, I don't know what the hell [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=321.04s)]
*  else to put it, sort of cowtowing to Putin over these last four years? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  What's remarkable and really regrettable is that this is not just a few comments about Putin being [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  a genius a couple weeks ago. This is years worth of Trump and his allies in the United States. And [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=342.64s)]
*  by the way, in parts of Europe as well, far-right nationalists praising Vladimir Putin, seeing him [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=348.08s)]
*  as this sort of avatar of a different political course, Republican voters have followed Trump [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=354.72s)]
*  to a kind of shocking degree. Not all of them, but again, there's a significant faction that have. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=362.56s)]
*  And to me, the indicator that really just hits in the gut is that Americans are so divided. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=368.08s)]
*  Polls have consistently shown that Republican voters, Putin is unpopular with Republicans and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=374.64s)]
*  Democrats in the U.S. So let's be clear about that. But he is far less unpopular with Republican [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=380.0s)]
*  voters than Joe Biden, the president of their own country. And not by a little bit, by like 20 points. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=385.68s)]
*  And so that's a shocking indicator. But what I would say is that it's still hard for me as well [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=393.2s)]
*  to understand as an American how there could be a large segment of our society that would be [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=401.44s)]
*  supporting Putin. One, they may not understand fully the nature of Putin's dictatorial regime, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=407.6s)]
*  the absolutely suffocating world of corruption and control that he's reimposed inside Russia. So [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  that's not necessarily something that you would think about every day if you're an American. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  Number two, look at our society. I would recommend to read about the period before the United States [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=427.12s)]
*  entered the Second World War and look at the history of the America First Movement. Look at [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=434.48s)]
*  what a large segment of American society was actually following Charles Lindbergh, not just [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=440.0s)]
*  resisting entry to the war, but actually saying, admiring things about Hitler's strength and the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=445.92s)]
*  like. That's a dangerous analogy to make. So I'm not saying it's the exact same thing, but [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=452.8s)]
*  politically that dynamic resonates, I would say. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=458.88s)]
*  Let's talk a bit more though about how we got to this point and what the U.S. role has been in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=462.32s)]
*  getting to this point. I mean, you've written quite often about the fact that the U.S. has misread [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=468.16s)]
*  Putin and his intentions for years, that for some reason American administrations, successive [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=474.0s)]
*  American administrations have either, will you tell me, did they not take him seriously? Did they [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  misread his intentions? Could you just talk a little bit about that? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=486.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a great question. In a way, Americans historically have tended to layer on [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=490.23999999999995s)]
*  some of their own ideas and perceptions onto Russia and onto Vladimir Putin for two decades. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=498.88s)]
*  I was stationed there in Moscow at the beginning, the first four years really, of Putin's tenure [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  as a leader. For much of that time, there was a real debate in the United States over those [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=512.24s)]
*  who saw him as former Vice President Dick Cheney. Actually, very clear-eyed said to a colleague [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=517.52s)]
*  right when he ascended, he said, you know, I look at that guy and I see KGB, KGB, KGB, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=523.36s)]
*  and you know what? He was right. But there was also President George W. Bush who looked into [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=528.4s)]
*  Putin's eyes and saw someone who he could do business with, who was a modern different kind [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=534.4s)]
*  of leader. And so there was a willful desire at times to see the Putin we wanted to see [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=541.12s)]
*  rather than the Putin who told us in 2005, right? 2005, Vladimir Putin said, the breakup of the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=547.28s)]
*  Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. You know what? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=555.44s)]
*  That had nothing to do with NATO expansion for Ukraine, which by the way, wasn't even a topic of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=560.96s)]
*  conversation until years later, right? And again, it just, it was unthinkable to many people that we [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=566.24s)]
*  would end up where we are. And of course, that's true of all wars. But in this case, there was [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=573.28s)]
*  example after example, and not just the Bush administration, the Obama administration, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=579.12s)]
*  I think really misread the situation with Putin because he had just [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=584.24s)]
*  militarily marched into Georgia next door in 2008. And yet months later, the Obama administration [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=589.1199999999999s)]
*  came in and wanted to have a reset and, you know, embraced a kind of fantasy version of this in which [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=596.4s)]
*  there was going to be a reformer, Dmitry Medvedev, temporarily in the president's position, and they [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=604.56s)]
*  were going to do business with him and there was going to be a different path forward. But the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=610.4s)]
*  lesson that Vladimir Putin got from that was, hey, I had a war of aggression against a neighbor and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  really there was no long-term damage to me. And unfortunately, you know, again, there's years worth [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=620.88s)]
*  of things like this. How would you describe President Trump's relationship with Putin? What [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=627.12s)]
*  was his sort of assessment of him? Do you have a theory about what that was about and what animated [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=633.2s)]
*  that? It's very clear that there was a Trump administration policy that wasn't all that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=638.96s)]
*  different from what you might have seen from any administration. And so we did continue the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=646.0s)]
*  sanctions on Russia that existed after the 2014 takeover of Crimea. We did provide [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=651.44s)]
*  defensive weapons like the javelins to Ukraine. That was actually over Trump's objection. And [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=660.0s)]
*  that's the thing. Trump did not support his own administration's policy. He had a very hostile [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=666.16s)]
*  view of NATO and his aides and advisors repeatedly had to talk him out of actually pulling out [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=671.92s)]
*  entirely. I don't think people understand that. It wasn't just rhetoric from Donald Trump about [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=677.52s)]
*  NATO being obsolete. He came very, very, very close, including in the summer of 2018. He [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  explicitly told his then national security advisor, John Bolton, his then White House Chief of Staff, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  John Kelly, that he was going to pull out of NATO. And they made a desperate last-ditch effort to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=695.44s)]
*  stop him from doing that. So there were many advisors, including Bolton, who stated publicly [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  that had Trump had a second term in office, that he was going to proceed with blowing up the NATO [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=708.48s)]
*  alliance. So that's number one. Those are facts. Number two, Trump not only embraced Putin as a [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=716.08s)]
*  strong man and a strong leader and a kind of figure of veneration and admiration, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=723.6s)]
*  and refused to take many steps that his advisors urged him to take regarding Putin, but he also [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  adopted Putin's view of Ukraine. The record, the sworn testimony in the impeachment trial, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=736.88s)]
*  was very clear that Trump did not believe that Ukraine was, he called it consistently, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  a corrupt country that doesn't support me. He adopted Putin's view that it was totally fine [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=749.76s)]
*  for Putin to have illegally annexed Crimea because he said, well, you know, those people there, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=757.2s)]
*  I don't think they wanted to be in Ukraine anyways. And so he would amplify the Russian-made [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=762.24s)]
*  disinformation conspiracy theory that it was not Russia, but Ukraine that actually intervened in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=767.28s)]
*  the U.S. 2016 election, which was always an absurd and untrue conspiracy theory. So the record, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=773.68s)]
*  again, is absolutely clear. It is not ambiguous. It is not hard to figure this out. It's not that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=780.3199999999999s)]
*  they're forgetting. It's that they don't want you to remember. You wrote a book about former [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=786.16s)]
*  Secretary of State James Baker. He had his desire as the Soviet Union was collapsing to get a [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=790.9599999999999s)]
*  handle on the nuclear weapons scattered throughout the Soviet stings. Why did he want to do that? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=796.3199999999999s)]
*  Why did he think that was important? And what's the relevance of that to today's moment? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=802.64s)]
*  Well, that's right. So a big part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was stationed in [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=807.36s)]
*  Ukraine when the Soviet Union unexpectedly collapsed. And so it became a priority, both of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=812.0s)]
*  the George W. Bush administration, Jim Baker, and then the subsequent Clinton administration, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=817.36s)]
*  to make sure that there was really only one nuclear power that they were dealing with. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=823.52s)]
*  And this was the enormous subject of negotiations. It was seen as crucial [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=827.12s)]
*  to the security of the world going forward. It takes enormous resources, of course, to maintain [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=831.44s)]
*  a nuclear arsenal. You don't want to proliferate the number of powers who have it. It was a real [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=837.0400000000001s)]
*  huge priority and seen as a great success of American diplomacy that we were able to negotiate [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  essentially the return of those weapons and Russia being the only successor nuclear state. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=849.7600000000001s)]
*  In exchange for that, there was the Budapest Memorandum in which Russia agreed to guarantee [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=854.72s)]
*  the sovereignty and independence of those states that gave up the weapons, including Ukraine. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=862.16s)]
*  So Russia is illegally violating a treaty itself committed to. And of course, for Ukrainians, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=867.84s)]
*  it feels like a double betrayal, right? They agreed to do the right thing for world security, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=875.12s)]
*  gave up their nuclear weapons. And here they are. If they had nuclear weapons, Russia probably [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=881.12s)]
*  wouldn't be invading them. And so it's a tragedy for Ukraine. It's a tragedy for the international [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=885.12s)]
*  system. But one other point that I've been thinking a lot when it comes to Jim Baker [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=892.0s)]
*  and the end of the Cold War, he and President George H.W. Bush were often criticized here in [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=897.28s)]
*  the US for moving too slowly, for exercising too much restraint. When it became clear that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=903.76s)]
*  what Reagan called the evil empire was unraveling, Americans, just like they are today, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=910.88s)]
*  actually cheering on Ukrainians and hoping against hope that they would succeed. At that time, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=915.92s)]
*  Americans were thrilled at the sort of eruption of freedom and democracy behind the Iron Curtain. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=922.48s)]
*  And they wanted Bush and Baker to do more and more and more. And Baker and Bush were very concerned [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=929.04s)]
*  not to alienate the Soviet superpower when it had all those nuclear weapons and it could [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  destroy the world. And so that tension really, there's an echo of that today, although, of course, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=941.04s)]
*  we're seeing that tragically the history reversed itself. Did that memorandum commit the West to [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=946.24s)]
*  certain obligations in exchange for the Ukrainians giving up their nuclear weapons? And what's the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=954.3199999999999s)]
*  relevance of that to the current argument about what the US and its allies should be doing here? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=961.6s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. It meant that we were guarantors, as well as Russia, to the independence and security [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=966.64s)]
*  of Ukraine. And so clearly we've learned that Russia does not keep its word. Clearly we've learned [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=975.28s)]
*  that it is willing to rip up an international agreement, which it signed apparently not in [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=982.88s)]
*  good faith. But the question is also on the US. We talk about an international system. We remain [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=988.4s)]
*  the world's strongest superpower. But if we're unwilling to defend that system when its core [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=995.1999999999999s)]
*  principles are being broken, of course, that is an enormous blow to the US power and prestige as well. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1001.6s)]
*  You're absolutely right about that. And so we have in fact chosen among terrible competing [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  demands. And what we've chosen is at the moment to say our commitment to NATO is sacrosanct. And [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1014.4s)]
*  if you move one inch into NATO, Vladimir Putin, our Article 5 commitment to defend all of those [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1021.84s)]
*  members will be met. But we've chosen that at the expense of the broader principles of international [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1028.8s)]
*  law and sovereignty that we also are committed to. Susan Glasser, thank you so much for talking with us. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0pSm6q-CvA&t=1044.4s)]
