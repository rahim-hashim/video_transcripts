# Baerbock on Putin: Peace Talks On One Hand, Bombing Hospitals On the Other | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y)
*  Foreign Minister Baerbach, let me ask you whether you feel you face Putin down over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  this oil. You've all been saying that he's been extorting you and blackmailing you with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=5.4s)]
*  demands to be paid for oil and gas in rubles and not euros, and then saying that he was [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=9.38s)]
*  going to cut off the exports. This has not transpired. He hasn't, and they're still [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=14.98s)]
*  running and he will continue to accept euros. Do you feel that you've faced him down? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=19.32s)]
*  Well, I wish I could say yes to this question, but this would be only the case when Ukraine [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=25.2s)]
*  is free again and when people in Ukraine can live in peace again, because the overall goal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  is that this bombing ends and that citizens of Ukraine can live safely in their country [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  again. So, unfortunately, even though it was very important that we gave a strong answer [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=46.56s)]
*  on this ruble question, that we are not being blackmailed and that we are not playing games, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=53.36s)]
*  but this is only one minor part, because the most important thing is that this bombing of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=59.52s)]
*  civilians ends. And you're in Kiev right now. You know how the situation is, for example, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=65.6s)]
*  in Mario Pol, that there are still more than 100,000 civilians in the city. And even though [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=70.56s)]
*  Putin is saying every other day that he's having, as he is calling it, peace negotiations, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=77.2s)]
*  but on the same moment he's bombing Mario Pol, he's bombing so-called humanitarian corridors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=83.68s)]
*  He's not allowing medicine and food inside the cities, which is obviously a violation of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=90.56s)]
*  humanitarian law, so it's war crimes. So you cannot say on the one hand that you're having [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=96.72s)]
*  so-called peace negotiations and on the other hand you're bombing hospitals. And unfortunately, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=102.16s)]
*  we see that his game is not only about rubles or euros being paid for gas, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=108.32s)]
*  but it's still the question that we need an end to this bombing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CirRneNkF5Y&t=114.39999999999999s)]
