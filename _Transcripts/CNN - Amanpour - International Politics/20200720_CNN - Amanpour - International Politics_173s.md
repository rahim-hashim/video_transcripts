Video Description: The U.S., Brazil and India are the only countries in the world with more than one million coronavirus cases. One common thread among them all: populist leaders. Many blame Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro for the country’s two million cases and nearly 77,000 dead. Despite having contracted the virus himself, Bolsonaro continues to downplay its risks, dismissing it as a “little flu.” He used his veto power to weaken laws that would protect the public, and so far has lost two ministers to the pandemic. Petra Costa is a Brazilian filmmaker whose award-winning documentary "The Edge of Democracy" warns of the threat to Brazil’s democratic institutions even beyond the pandemic. 

Originally aired on July 17, 2020.

# A Threat to Brazil’s Democracy Beyond the Pandemic  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk)
*  What does it feel like as you hear the totals and the caseload increasing daily? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=0.0s)]
*  It feels like being trapped in a nightmare because all of this could have been avoided. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=6.0s)]
*  Brazil wasn't hit by the virus until it had hit already Italy, the United States. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=11.8s)]
*  We had all the media pressuring the government to take measures, but Bolsonaro really resisted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=19.12s)]
*  and has done the most absurd remarks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=26.38s)]
*  For example, when questioned about the mounting deaths, he said, I'm not a grave digger. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=29.58s)]
*  So what? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=34.7s)]
*  Everyone's destiny is to die. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=35.7s)]
*  He has boycotted initiatives from mayors, governors that have tried to stop the pandemic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=38.14s)]
*  As you said, he didn't just change one, but two health ministers and is putting us all [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=45.34s)]
*  state of paralysis as the deaths continue mounting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=52.54s)]
*  His indifference only grows. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=56.7s)]
*  Petra, we're watching this horrible video, of course, of the graves going into the coffins [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  going into the ground. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=66.38s)]
*  And we've seen in, for instance, the Amazon region, we've seen mass graves in Manaus, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=67.38s)]
*  the capital there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=72.1s)]
*  I mean, obviously the pictures are telling a very dramatic story. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=73.1s)]
*  I wonder whether you've noticed any change in tone from Bolsonaro, your president, since [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=76.34s)]
*  he himself contracted the disease. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=81.78s)]
*  He has covid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  He announced that with a smirk on his face and used it as an opportunity to become a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=87.3s)]
*  poster boy for chloroquine, taking it in a video and saying that it was working well [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  for him and that he was fine and using it really to downplay the seriousness of the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=98.42s)]
*  virus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=103.22s)]
*  And it's also quite strange that months ago in March he had gone to a trip to the United [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=104.22s)]
*  States and 20 people from his delegation became contaminated and he refused to show his tests [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=108.9s)]
*  at the time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=115.62s)]
*  He only did so after the Supreme Court forced him to do so. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=116.62s)]
*  And now he volunteered this information in the moment where he's involved in a huge corruption [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=120.06s)]
*  scandal and where that's in the media and it seems like a perfect plot to divert attention. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=125.1s)]
*  And perhaps to get some sympathy, let me ask you, have his poll numbers suffered? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  He was elected in a landslide in 2018. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=138.86s)]
*  Has his popularity sunk at all or is he still very popular? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=142.3s)]
*  His popularity diminished even more after the pandemic and after these scandals, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=148.46s)]
*  but it continues very solid at 30 percent. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKfYnvcPgSk&t=154.3s)]
