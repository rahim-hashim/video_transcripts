Video Description: One topic was absent from the NATO meeting this week: Iran. Well over 200 people have been killed in a brutal crackdown against protestors, according to Amnesty International, with the Trump administration claiming the death toll could be over 1,000. Yet UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that Iran didn’t come up at all during the NATO meeting. Anti-government protests there began last month, initially opposing a massive overnight hike in fuel prices and soon gaining momentum across the country. The Iranian regime shut down the internet and responded with extraordinary force, reportedly shooting unarmed civilians. Now, with the internet gradually coming back, videos and reports are corroborating these accounts of what appears to be the deadliest crackdown in the 40 years since the Islamic Revolution. Farnaz Fassihi has been closely documenting these unfolding events for the New York Times, and joins the program to discuss her findings. 

Originally aired on December 6, 2019.

# Farnaz Fassihi Discusses Protests in Iran | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [December 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc)
*  Can you just sum up for us what you know from your contacts with Iranians or whoever, however [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=0.0s)]
*  you're getting this information? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=5.2s)]
*  What we know is that the gas price increase sparked protests which were peaceful for about [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=7.08s)]
*  24 hours, and then they turned out to be much more targeting the regime, rather than just [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=13.66s)]
*  an economic grievance. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  We saw that protests spread all across Iran in cities big and small, from Shiraz and Isfahan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=23.28s)]
*  to smaller towns, working class neighborhoods, and really the majority of people who came [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=28.68s)]
*  out seemed to be in the young demographics of between 19 to 26, and most of them pretty [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=34.24s)]
*  fed up with the Islamic Republic establishment and saying it as such. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=42.08s)]
*  And Iran's leadership took the extraordinary measure of shutting down internet across the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=47.64s)]
*  country and basically opening fire on unarmed civilians. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=54.68s)]
*  The death toll continues to climb. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=59.56s)]
*  The numbers are anywhere between 208. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=62.04s)]
*  That's the latest Amnesty International number. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=65.36s)]
*  To our sources telling us that up to 450 people have been killed, thousands injured, and 8,000 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=67.8s)]
*  people arrested. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=74.52s)]
*  This is an unprecedented level of violence and crackdown by the Islamic Republic in a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=75.86s)]
*  very short period. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=81.32s)]
*  We haven't seen these kind of numbers since the revolution in 40 years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=82.52s)]
*  So you and I were both there in 2009, and we saw the so-called Green Revolution, where [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  there was unprecedented protests against the regime. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=92.44s)]
*  This was over a disputed election, and there were some deaths. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=96.52s)]
*  But this seems to be so much worse. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think the regime has responded in this way this time? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=103.88s)]
*  I think the Islamic Republic's leadership and regime is under pressure from multiple [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=109.76s)]
*  fronts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=114.92s)]
*  They're facing very tough economic sanctions from the Trump administration. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=115.92s)]
*  They're facing a budget deficit and a lot of tensions with the West. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=120.72s)]
*  Their regional power and influence is being challenged in the streets of Iraq and Lebanon, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=125.44s)]
*  where they thought that they had a grip on sort of political dominance there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=131.0s)]
*  And they did not want to be caught at a moment of weakness domestically. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=138.44s)]
*  You have had contact with people in a certain province there about a particularly gruesome [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=143.92s)]
*  — I mean, it just sounds like an execution. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  And some pictures have been coming out which show, I mean, really terrible things going [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  on at close range. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=158.26s)]
*  All the videos that came from Iran over the past — over the period of violence, which [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=160.16s)]
*  is about four days — showed security forces indiscriminately shooting from close range [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=165.52s)]
*  at unarmed protesters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=171.68s)]
*  Protesters who were throwing rocks were being shot down by machine guns, by security forces [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=174.28s)]
*  in uniform. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvbVZk75vCc&t=179.4s)]
