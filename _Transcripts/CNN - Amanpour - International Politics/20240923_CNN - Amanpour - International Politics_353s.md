# Israel, Lebanon, Gaza: Ireland PM on Escalating Tensions in the Middle East | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg)
*  Now, among world leaders here at the U.M., one of America's closest allies, Ireland, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=0.0s)]
*  has taken a different approach to ending the war in Gaza by officially recognizing a Palestinian [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=5.24s)]
*  state and criticizing Israel's conduct of the war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=10.76s)]
*  Ireland's Prime Minister, the Titoch, Simon Harris, is joining me live right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=14.84s)]
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Can I just ask you, because today the story is really bad about Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  We've already seen that more than 270 have been killed in today alone and more than a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=27.08s)]
*  thousand injured. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=32.32s)]
*  You have hundreds of peacekeepers in that very, very tense area along the border between [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=33.6s)]
*  Israel and Lebanon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=39.36s)]
*  Is there anything that you're hearing that can de-escalate this, or is this now all-out [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=41.4s)]
*  war? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=46.2s)]
*  I think what we've seen today is an extraordinarily dangerous situation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=47.2s)]
*  We have seen effectively the opening of a potentially catastrophic second front in terms [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=50.4s)]
*  of the war in the Middle East. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=55.6s)]
*  We're also seeing civilians being targeted again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  We're not seeing a targeted response to terrorism here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=61.52s)]
*  What we're actually seeing is, amongst those dead so far, at least 21 children now confirmed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=64.76s)]
*  dead as well, at least a thousand people injured. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=70.08s)]
*  So the pattern, unfortunately, of flouting international law and disregard for rules [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  of engagement in terms of protecting civilians is yet again being completely and utterly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=77.4s)]
*  disregarded. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=81.6s)]
*  It's a really, really dangerous situation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=82.76s)]
*  I'm pleased to say that our peacekeepers are safe and are secure, but it's the civilians [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=84.76s)]
*  who don't have the ability to defend themselves, don't have the ability to protect themselves, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=88.84s)]
*  that I'm really, really concerned of. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=92.48s)]
*  We should be here at the United Nations this week talking about de-escalation, and instead [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=94.2s)]
*  we're going to be meeting at a UN General Assembly against the backdrop of escalation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=98.08s)]
*  And do you think some have suggested, including American officials, that actually this General [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=102.0s)]
*  Assembly could inflame the situation there rather than de-escalate, depending on various, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  I guess, leaders' speeches? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope not. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=114.48s)]
*  I think we have to remind ourselves of the very purpose of the United Nations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=115.84s)]
*  I mean, the United Nations was founded to resolve conflicts peacefully and politically. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=118.72s)]
*  And I do think the world now, and world leaders as we gather here, needs to ask ourselves [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=124.12s)]
*  about the consistent application of the rule of law and of international law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=128.08s)]
*  We cannot have a situation where international law must be applied to some but can be disregarded [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=132.32s)]
*  by others. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=136.68s)]
*  Israel, of course, has a right to live in security and safety. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=137.68s)]
*  Of course Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=140.96s)]
*  Of course Israel has a right to address any terrorist attack that it experiences. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=143.24s)]
*  But that is not what we're seeing now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=148.84s)]
*  What we're actually seeing is a blatant disregard for international law, no consideration in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  terms of protection of civilians, and yet again children finding themselves caught up [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=154.94s)]
*  in the midst of conflict. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=158.84s)]
*  This is the Lebanon front that you're talking about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Now let's talk about the Gaza front, which almost has fallen off the front pages now, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=162.56s)]
*  and people in Gaza are actually very worried about that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  You, Ireland, took a very different approach months ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=169.4s)]
*  You specifically recognized, along with Norway and Spain, a Palestinian state. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=174.56s)]
*  You had a huge amount of pushback from Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=180.68s)]
*  You have, what, how would you describe it? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=183.8s)]
*  Cold relations? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any influence anymore, let's say, around trying to get a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  or at least humanitarian intervention into Gaza? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=191.72s)]
*  So I think it's really important that when you have a foreign policy that you're consistent [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=194.44s)]
*  in terms of its application. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=198.08s)]
*  Ireland doesn't define itself as pro or anti any one country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=199.8s)]
*  Ireland defines itself as pro-international law, pro-human rights, and pro-peace. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=203.12s)]
*  And that is the approach we took. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=207.72000000000003s)]
*  You've got to remember, in our history, we know what it's like to want the world to see [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=208.8s)]
*  you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=213.06s)]
*  We know what it's like to struggle for statehood. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=214.06s)]
*  And therefore we felt it was very important, at a time when others were trying to quash [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=216.28s)]
*  any glimmer of a two-state solution, to actually say to the people of Palestine, we see you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=220.18s)]
*  We see you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=225.3s)]
*  We hear you. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=226.3s)]
*  We forget you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=227.3s)]
*  And we can differentiate very clearly between Hamas, a brutal, horrific terrorist organization [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=228.38000000000002s)]
*  that offers no hope of a future to the people of Palestine, and the people of Palestine [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  who aspire for the basic things we all aspire for, to statehood, for freedom, for democracy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  And we want to see two states, Israel and Palestine, living peacefully side by side. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=242.62s)]
*  That's why we did it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  We're not a military power. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  But we do have an ability, I believe, on the international stage to actually say, no, hang [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  on a second. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  If you believe in a two-state solution, the recognition of the existence of two states [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  is an important place to start. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=257.18s)]
*  Before that, obviously, has to be an end to the war between Israel and Palestine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  Is there any hint that you're getting that these stalled ceasefire negotiations over [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=264.44s)]
*  Gaza with Hamas can in any way be unlocked? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=269.68s)]
*  And will that kind of fall off the agenda as a whole new front is being massively opened? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  Being very honest, the world is not doing enough. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=279.7s)]
*  We've got to be really truthful about this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=281.62s)]
*  I don't in any way doubt the bona fides, the effort, the tireless work of many to help [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=283.54s)]
*  bring about a ceasefire. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=288.66s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=289.66s)]
*  I know so many people are working so hard to bring about a ceasefire. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=290.66s)]
*  But we've got to be honest. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=292.78s)]
*  You can try your best and it can still be ineffective. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=294.22s)]
*  The reality of the situation at the moment is Nehányáhu, for whatever reason, has calculated [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=296.6s)]
*  that he can continue in terms of the violence, in terms of the brutality, in terms of the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=300.66s)]
*  loss of civilian life. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=305.54s)]
*  We as a world have to do something to change that calculation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=306.98s)]
*  And that's why I've consistently said at an EU level it involves the EU reviewing the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=309.9s)]
*  association agreement between the EU and Israel because that has human rights clauses in it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=313.7s)]
*  In my mind, human rights clauses aren't put in international agreements to pad them out [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=318.06s)]
*  or to read nicely. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  They have to mean something. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  So I do think as we gather here at the UN, we do need to dig deep to say what levers [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=323.62s)]
*  are at the disposal of the world to change that calculation so that Benjamin Nehányáhu [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  realizes and to us that a ceasefire must actually be brought about. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=331.62s)]
*  And I don't think we've done enough in that space, being very honest. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiuqK7XeGRg&t=335.46s)]
