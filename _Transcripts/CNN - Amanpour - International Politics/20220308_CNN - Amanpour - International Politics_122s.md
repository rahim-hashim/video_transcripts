Video Description: The British government is being criticized for choking off the flow of refugees with red tape: Out of almost 20,000 applications, just a few hundred visas have so far been issued to Ukrainian refugees. Meanwhile, the independent Norwegian Refugee Council has announced plans to support 800,000 victims of the conflict, both inside and outside Ukraine. The organization's secretary general joins the show from Oslo.

*  And war crimes, as we've heard, you know, the ICC is beginning an investigation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, this is really very, very serious. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=4.08s)]
*  And in the meantime, we've talked about the many countries who are taking in, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=6.0s)]
*  you know, nearly two million now, hundreds of thousands in various countries around, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=10.0s)]
*  but not here in the UK. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=14.92s)]
*  There's been criticism of the UK system whereby some 300 visas out of some 20,000 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=16.56s)]
*  plus applications have been processed to date. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=23.36s)]
*  What would you say to the British? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  We had a very powerful intervention to Parliament, a historic really, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  from President Zelensky in Kyiv. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=33.28s)]
*  What I would say to Britain, as all of the other nations, be part now of a European [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=37.28s)]
*  responsibility sharing scheme. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Poland cannot take more than a million refugees. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=46.84s)]
*  I mean, all of Europe said we couldn't take a million. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Why should Poland be alone on showing that? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Moldova, very poor, have tens and tens of thousands now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=56.8s)]
*  So, of course, the UK and all of the rest would have to be part of this responsibility [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=62.16s)]
*  sharing for people leaving as well as for assisting all of those left behind in Ukraine, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=68.36s)]
*  which will cost billions and billions and billions of dollars that cannot be taken [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=76.96s)]
*  from the even poorer people in Afghanistan and Somalia and in Sahel and in the Congo. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  We're overstretched and underfunded with 80 million refugees and internally displaced [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=91.76s)]
*  people before Ukraine happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  All of that. We're looking to UK. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  We're looking to all of Europe and all of the other donor countries. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qt24L-gH4&t=102.0s)]
