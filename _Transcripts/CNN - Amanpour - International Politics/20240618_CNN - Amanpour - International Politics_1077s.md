# Taiwan’s Fmr. Minister of Digital Affairs on AI, Elections, and China  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [June 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs)
*  Now, when it comes to any election, technology is the main tool that's used to share important [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=0.0s)]
*  information. So how can it be leveraged to tackle fake content? Our next guest is an [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=5.68s)]
*  expert in this field. Audrey Tong, Taiwan's former digital affairs minister, has used [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  a wide range of strategies to address this problem. With a book called Plurality, it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=16.66s)]
*  details how the internet, which is a divisive space for so many, can also provide immense [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=22.04s)]
*  opportunities for bridge building and collaboration. Tong explains how to hurry Sreenivasan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=27.62s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. Audrey Tong, thanks so much for joining us. You are the former minister [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=33.1s)]
*  of digital affairs of Taiwan and you're the co-author of a new book called Plurality. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=39.3s)]
*  It's an open source book. First, what is plurality? Why this title? Why this idea? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=45.1s)]
*  Plurality means collaboration across diversity and the technology that enables this kind [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=52.34s)]
*  of collaboration. Think about 10 years ago when Uber first came to Taiwan, there's this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=57.34s)]
*  pro taxi parts, there's this pro Uber parts. But instead of repeating the divisions, we [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=63.02s)]
*  coded up open source technologies that let people see the bridges across the different [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=69.86s)]
*  camps. And so we very quickly settled on a, I wouldn't say compromise, a co-created solution [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=74.94s)]
*  that made it problem solved with the society's input. So that's plurality. And it's open [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=80.6s)]
*  source, just like the technology we use. So anybody can take a copy online and download [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=86.54s)]
*  at plurality.net and contribute. You mentioned this sort of tension between Uber and taxis. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  How did technology build a bridge or highlight bridges between what would otherwise be two [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  divided camps? In democracies with a lower bit rate and a higher latency, meaning that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  you have to wait for four years and to cast a vote, which carries maybe three bits of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  information. Sometimes you see one side winning for four years and another four years has [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=115.42s)]
*  passed by and another side wins, the other side loses, and so on and so forth. There's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  very little room for co-creation. But in Taiwan, we use this system called POLIS, which is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=125.18s)]
*  a Wiki survey. Like survey, it asks you a bunch of yes or no questions. Like a Wiki, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=130.34s)]
*  these questions are your fellow citizens' feelings. So everybody can say that, oh, I [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=136.74s)]
*  feel that surge pricing is fine, but undercutting existing meters isn't. Or that I feel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  that insurance is very important, regardless whether the driver has a professional license [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=147.8s)]
*  and so on. And so for each and every of these statements, you can unlike, you can like, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=152.44s)]
*  but you cannot reply. So people's attention is not sucked into this online flame wars, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  trolling, dunking, or things like that. But rather, it promotes people because there's a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=162.86s)]
*  real-time scoreboard that shows the people's statements that flows to the top because [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=167.6s)]
*  they're embraced by both sides. So very quickly, we set along a very neat package of like [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=172.92s)]
*  10 recommendations and put that into law. And so just by gamifying it a little bit, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=178.78s)]
*  instead of the one that's more distracting, highlighting the one that is the most [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=184.62s)]
*  bridging. And the same algorithm also inspired community notes on x.com previously, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=188.54s)]
*  so that you can also participate in the community notes repository. But it's open source and the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  notes that end up becoming displayed are the ones that speak across the device. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=201.0s)]
*  One of the things that you outline in the book is how it's called sort of G0V0, Gov0. Explain [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=205.12s)]
*  what you were trying to do with that in Taiwan. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=213.56s)]
*  So for example, Gov.tw, that's the Taiwan government's website. If you change the O to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=216.66s)]
*  a zero, then you get into G0V.tw, which is this open source civic tech movement. And the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=224.42s)]
*  reason why is that, for example, 10 years ago, it was the budgets that was very hard to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=232.1s)]
*  understand. They were locked in PDFs and so on, or the legislature's debates and so on. So [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=238.26s)]
*  part of the promise of the Gov0 movement is this radical transparency, making sure that the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=245.08s)]
*  everyday people, when they feel that they want to know more about government function, about [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  democracy, and so on, the information, even if it's not on their fingertips, they can change the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=257.2s)]
*  website and change the O to a zero and get into the shadow websites that explains things [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=263.04s)]
*  And because it is open source, sometimes the government is shamed into merging back this new [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=269.14s)]
*  design so that the service experience is better. So that started from 2012. And after I became [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  the digital minister in 2016, I have systematically merged all those innovations into [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=281.94s)]
*  the government, including, for example, contact tracing, visualization of mosque availability, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=287.97999999999996s)]
*  so on and so forth during the pandemic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=293.62s)]
*  All right, so something really important happened between 2012 and 2016. And that was the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=295.68s)]
*  demonstrations, the sunflower student movement. And tell the audience a little bit about what [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=301.8s)]
*  your role was during that time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=308.0s)]
*  In 2014, many students feel that this sudden passing of a trade deal with Beijing regime makes [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=311.36s)]
*  it very difficult for people to understand even why that is being passed because it's just [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=321.92s)]
*  being rushed through. And so people thought that we need a real deliberation on each and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=327.18s)]
*  every aspect instead of just a single package. So, for example, we were building the then new [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=333.62s)]
*  4G core network and whether allowing Huawei or ZTE into that 4G core network, is that a good [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  idea. That's probably warrant a debate, right? And so people just stormed into the parliament [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  during the night when there was nobody there. And I was there supporting the bandwidth [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=353.56s)]
*  required to live stream this entire event. And so I would continue that role with the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=358.48s)]
*  GovZero people for the next three weeks. And because every corner is live streamed, it had [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=365.6s)]
*  two effects. One, there's no violence around the occupied parliamentary area. And second, it [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=370.88s)]
*  actually converged instead of like most occupied, which diverged over time. Because if you go to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=377.98s)]
*  the occupied site, if you enter your company's tax ID number, you can very easily see how exactly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=383.9s)]
*  does the trade deal affects you and then join one of those deliberations going on. And because it's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=390.2s)]
*  all captured in live stream, summarized, read out the next morning, every day we inch a little bit [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=395.86s)]
*  more toward rough consensus. At the end of it, people can live with it with a lot of agreements, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  just like the Uber case. And so the head of the parliament eventually said, okay, if that's what [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  people want, we will just do that. So the end result is that people do not agree to sign the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  cross trade service and trade agreement. People thought that anything like that should be treated [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=418.74s)]
*  as a treaty with a foreign government instead of a special constitutionally defined government. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=425.4s)]
*  And also people understood that there needs to be more transparency in the legislative process [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=434.44s)]
*  itself. The party to party negotiation and so on needs to be live streamed. There needs to be a lot [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=440.04s)]
*  more accountability in the entire process and so on. And so a lot of that ended up becoming the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=444.92s)]
*  open parliament action plan, which you can look up in Taiwan's governmental website. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=451.34s)]
*  Okay, so through this process, through this demonstration, through these protests, you get to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=456.38s)]
*  a point that where you're saying, look, the people of Taiwan shouldn't sign this trade pact with [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=462.94s)]
*  China. How did that sit with China? The idea that this was not just meeting resistance, but in such [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=469.53999999999996s)]
*  a digital and transparent and public way? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=478.64s)]
*  With half a million people on the street and many more online, this demonstration is more than a [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  protest. It is a demo. It shows how democracy can evolve as a social technology. I cannot speak on [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=489.32s)]
*  behalf of the Beijing regime, of course, but we have seen that their reactions to our social media [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=497.91999999999996s)]
*  is quite different. Whereas we embrace the pro-social social media we just talked about. They [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=506.22s)]
*  seem to, around that time, 2014-ish, think that it is something of grave danger to their polity, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  that if people organize this way with half a million people on the street through social media, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=520.74s)]
*  the stability of their control on their population may be greatly threatened. And so they [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=527.14s)]
*  invested a lot of money, a lot of resources into so-called harmonization of the Internet and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=532.88s)]
*  making sure that the civil society space online shrinks year after year, ever since 2014. So I [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=538.52s)]
*  think, yeah, I think this demonstration in Taiwan also showed everyone else what social media can [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=545.32s)]
*  do, but authoritarian regimes responded quite differently from Taiwan. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=551.84s)]
*  I do want to ask a little bit about what you were able to implement during the pandemic. What were [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=556.88s)]
*  some of the policies that you were able to implement quickly that kind of set the tone for how [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=560.9799999999999s)]
*  Taiwan was going to manage this global pandemic that literally across the strait was doing just [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=567.14s)]
*  incalculable human damage? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=574.54s)]
*  A key is that we responded very, very quickly. So 10 days before WHO, the World Health [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  Organization took decisive action and we ensured that people knew very early on that mask use is [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=585.56s)]
*  critical. But at the time, people were not very sure about aerosol or mask efficacy and so on. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=593.36s)]
*  So our communication strategy is rather different. In addition to daily 2 p.m. press [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=600.8s)]
*  conferences, in addition to a hotline when I can call to ask any questions, there are also ways like [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  what we call humor over rumor, making sure that there's a very cute spoke stock, a shiba inu that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=612.86s)]
*  puts her paw on the face saying that wear a mask to block your dirty and washed hands from your [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  face or something. And it's very funny. So it went viral. And so making sure that whenever people [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=625.0600000000001s)]
*  hear something that they don't quite understand, instead of debunking the rumor after the rumor [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=631.9s)]
*  already appeared, we pre-bunked the rumor by ensuring that people understand where it's coming [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=637.5s)]
*  from and how to react to it with a more relaxed attitude or even humorous attitude. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=642.64s)]
*  For example, there was a young boy who caught one into a hotline saying your rationale masks now, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=648.92s)]
*  which is fine, but all I got was pink ones, which is not fine. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=654.32s)]
*  I'm a boy. I don't want to wear pink to school. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=657.4s)]
*  The very next day on the daily pandemic conference, every minister's director general's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=660.12s)]
*  everyone wore pink regardless of their gender. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=665.84s)]
*  And it's become very fashionable. All the fashionable brands and so on turn pink. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=669.24s)]
*  So imagine if we had to debunk, if the minister of education when bullying is bad, that that won't [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=673.9s)]
*  work. Right. But by having pink being the most fashionable color, it actually worked and increased [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=680.26s)]
*  people's interest in wearing rainbow masks or all sort of masks that massively increase mask use. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=686.0s)]
*  So is that all of society effort? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=691.98s)]
*  Wow. Well, when you talk about pre-bunking misinformation or dealing with the kinds of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=694.12s)]
*  challenges, it seems that it's gotten much more difficult since COVID, in part because technology [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  has improved where now it's not that hard for me to create a deep fake of myself or of you. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  And I wonder in that, in this new era that we're heading into, how do you inform and make sure [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=714.5200000000001s)]
*  that your population is digitally literate enough where they might not have to be sort of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=723.6s)]
*  first line fact checkers for everything. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=729.36s)]
*  But how do you prepare them for this new reality? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=731.22s)]
*  What we did in terms of pre-bunking went way before this election, this January. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=735.84s)]
*  Already in 2022, I defaked myself in front of a monitor showing exactly how it's done and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=741.5s)]
*  share it to the people so that people know that although currently it takes 12 hours, very quickly, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=748.3s)]
*  this would just take 12 minutes and very quickly, just 12 seconds. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  And now we're at the milliseconds range, which means that deep fake can be in real time talking to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=757.92s)]
*  you now. Right. But we have prepared people's minds against this possibility. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=763.3599999999999s)]
*  And I really think the key is not just literacy. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=769.0799999999999s)]
*  Literacy is when you consume. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  But starting 2019, we changed in our curriculum, all the words, digital literacy, media [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=774.02s)]
*  literacy, data literacy into competence. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=779.66s)]
*  Competence is when you co-create, when you contribute. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=782.78s)]
*  So instead of just viewing the news with a critical mindset, you can contribute to the fact [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=786.42s)]
*  checking. So these are the what we call societal resilience ideas. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=792.02s)]
*  So that even if you're a junior high school student, if you're really diligent and you want to [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=797.42s)]
*  contribute to fact checking, you can actually be a like a Wikipedia avid poster and add a lot of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=802.74s)]
*  context to what's going on. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=809.5600000000001s)]
*  And because many people use that, it let us see in real time which rumors are trending, which ones [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=811.12s)]
*  having a basic reproduction number of more than one, which are ones are literally going viral. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=817.64s)]
*  And we get them to ignore the rest, not to spend too much time on it because it's self-limiting. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=822.88s)]
*  Andre, I'd like to ask you maybe a personal question. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=829.22s)]
*  And you identify as transgender and non-binary. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=832.98s)]
*  And I wonder if it's non-binary, not just in gender, it's really in everything. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=836.1800000000001s)]
*  And I wonder how that informs your outlook. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=841.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we literally have been talking in this conversation about ways where you're building [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=843.34s)]
*  bridges between different parties and so forth. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=849.82s)]
*  And I wonder if somewhere the work that you're doing today is influenced in form by who you are and how [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=853.12s)]
*  you see the world. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=862.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=863.96s)]
*  So I just recently learned that on iPhones, the contact book, there are the pronoun fields. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=865.2s)]
*  And when a friend asked me to fill in my details, and so I said that I filled in that my pronouns are [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=872.36s)]
*  any, all and whatever, meaning that I can't get offended. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=878.2s)]
*  And so that's really like that in my mind. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=882.5s)]
*  I don't think half of the population is farther away from me and half is closer to me on the HR form [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=885.02s)]
*  that I filed in 2016 when I first became digital minister. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=893.14s)]
*  There were no digital ministers before in Taiwan. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=896.5799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=899.14s)]
*  So I had to come up with my own job description and so on. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=899.38s)]
*  So I filed not applicable to the gender field and not applicable to the party field. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=902.74s)]
*  So I have no party affiliation. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=909.3s)]
*  I consider all the different parties just parts of the fabric that we can weave trust. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=911.2399999999999s)]
*  And so I think it does affect my outlook because if at some point I feel that, oh, these people, the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=917.4799999999999s)]
*  taxi drivers, they're closer to me and the Uber drivers, they're farther away from me. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=923.68s)]
*  I would then tell myself I need to spend more time with the other group so that I can also see the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=928.8s)]
*  world from their eyes. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=934.8s)]
*  The book that you're talking about and the idea that you're talking about of plurality, how is it [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=936.66s)]
*  possible for these ideas to improve the relationship between Taiwan and China? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=943.22s)]
*  I mean, right now there is an incredible source of tension from the United States and lots of [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=949.78s)]
*  European nations and China right now over Taiwan. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=957.22s)]
*  And so if we were able to take the ideas from your book, distribute them widely to people who are [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=960.68s)]
*  on kind of different sides of this equation, how can they use that to bring the temperature down? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=968.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think it will depolarize effectively a lot of the conversations in the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=976.36s)]
*  democracies in the allies that does support Taiwan. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=984.2199999999999s)]
*  But sometimes because of election dynamics and so on, the PRC sometimes says that democracy only [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=988.18s)]
*  leads to chaos or democracy never delivers and so on. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=997.38s)]
*  They don't quite come out and say that directly. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1000.66s)]
*  These words, my words, not theirs. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1003.5s)]
*  But they certainly seem to suggest that the authoritarian way may be more harmonic in many [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1006.26s)]
*  regards. But if we have implemented plurality widely across democracies, just like Finland, who [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1013.26s)]
*  have also asked what the Finnish people think and almost one million votes are cast on the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1020.8s)]
*  Polish platform so people can at a glance see very clearly what are the bridges, what are the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1026.44s)]
*  divides in the country, in the society, and then take real actions to address those, then I think it [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1032.04s)]
*  will make democracies much more plural and much less polarized. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1038.48s)]
*  And once we have depolarized ourselves, we would have more capacity to also de-escalate many of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1042.62s)]
*  those international relationship issues. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  Audrey Tong, the former Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan and a co-author of Plurality. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1051.5s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1058.06s)]
*  Thank you. Live long and prosper. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnY2zNjvjLs&t=1059.82s)]
