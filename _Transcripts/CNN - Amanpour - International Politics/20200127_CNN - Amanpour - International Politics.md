# New Yorker Correspondent Joshua Yaffa Playing the Game in Putin's Russia  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I)
*  We turn now to Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has been in charge for two decades. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=0.0s)]
*  And that means a whole generation of Russians has been dubbed the Putin generation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=5.0s)]
*  Joshua Yaffa is a Moscow correspondent for The New Yorker. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=10.0s)]
*  His new book, Between Two Fires, reveals how ambitious Russians, from politicians to filmmakers, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=13.0s)]
*  balance their own dreams with doing what it takes to survive in this system. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=19.0s)]
*  He told our Hari Srinivasan about how Putin maintains his rule and legitimacy in modern Russia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=24.0s)]
*  So let's start with a little bit of the current news. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=31.0s)]
*  We recently had parts of the Russian government step down. What does this mean? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=34.0s)]
*  I think what we're seeing is the beginning of the transition process, if it's even fair to call it that, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=39.0s)]
*  because I think in any transition process, Putin himself isn't really going anywhere. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=45.0s)]
*  He's going to stay, perhaps in perpetuity, as the ultimate arbiter of the system, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=50.0s)]
*  the one who resolves conflicts, manages relationships between various political clans and interests. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=56.0s)]
*  But it does seem like he's at least formally going to leave the presidency, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=62.0s)]
*  what he should do according to the Constitution in 2024. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=66.0s)]
*  So I think this reshuffle of the government, in fact the dismissal of the government appointment of new ministers, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=70.0s)]
*  and calls to amend the Constitution, it's not the final arrangement of power, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=77.0s)]
*  but rather the opening gambit in what's going to be a long chess play that should unfold really over the next years, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=84.0s)]
*  all the way through 2024 as Putin prepares for himself a kind of soft retirement, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=90.0s)]
*  where in fact he still remains, as I said, the highest and most authoritative political figure, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=96.0s)]
*  but reconfigures power in such a way that he can leave the office of the presidency, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=102.0s)]
*  prepare a new generation of leaders, but who in the end are ultimately beholden to his authority. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=107.0s)]
*  So why bother with this almost veil of democracy, if he knows, the government knows, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=114.0s)]
*  and ultimately the people know that he's still the guy pulling the strings? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=124.0s)]
*  Throughout Putin's 20 years in power, what's been interesting to observe is how much he cares about the veneer of democratic institutions, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=129.0s)]
*  or rather the veneer of a kind of legitimacy that comes from an adherence to law, to process, to following the rules. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=138.0s)]
*  Of course, that is often a hollow, if not absurd idea when it is he who gets to set the rules, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=148.0s)]
*  so following them isn't so hard when you're the one dictating what the rules are. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=155.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, Putin's whole image, especially when he came to power, but really in the years that have followed, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=159.0s)]
*  has been that of someone who has restored order and functionality to the Russian state after the weakness and chaos of the Soviet collapse [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=166.0s)]
*  and the 90s when the Russian state was in a period of disorder, of disorganization, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=176.0s)]
*  and the populace was left really unsure and disoriented about their own fates and about the fate of the country as a whole. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=182.0s)]
*  You dive into some of the kind of nuances of government and the people and how they're affected by it and how they affect it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=190.0s)]
*  What's the kind of through line? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=199.0s)]
*  You know, I started to work on the book when I realized as a journalist there was something about Russia [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=202.0s)]
*  that I wasn't able to say in the articles I was writing and the reporting I was doing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=207.0s)]
*  And I, like many reporters, and this is a very fair and correct prism for viewing Russia, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=212.0s)]
*  but saw Putin and all the little Putin's around him versus the people who were trapped by repressive laws, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=219.0s)]
*  by propaganda in this cage that they couldn't escape from but would like to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=228.0s)]
*  And as time went on, I began to see that that wasn't really capturing the whole of Russia as I was living it and experiencing it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=233.0s)]
*  And in fact, most people's lives were lived somewhere in the middle. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=241.0s)]
*  They weren't venal, corrupt, cynical officials, but nor were they brave, quixotic, heroic freedom fighters [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=246.0s)]
*  who were ready to risk everything to stand up to that system. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=255.0s)]
*  Most people, in fact, and I started to feel that maybe I would have been in exactly that same position, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=259.0s)]
*  were looking to reach a kind of accommodation with the system. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=265.0s)]
*  And that act of compromise on the micro scale, on the level of the individual, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=269.0s)]
*  was very fascinating to me to understand how that actually works in people's lives in practice. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=274.0s)]
*  And also on the macro scale, on the scale of the whole country, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=280.0s)]
*  it seemed to me that that was a key and really interesting way to understand how the Putin system functions [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=283.0s)]
*  and why has it proved so durable. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=290.0s)]
*  I want to highlight for the audience a few of the characters that you go through. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=293.0s)]
*  One of them is an orthodox priest. What is he fighting? What does he settle on? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=296.0s)]
*  Right. This is a priest named Father Pavel Adelgeim. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=300.0s)]
*  He became a priest in the 1950s as a young man in then the Soviet Union, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=305.0s)]
*  which was a nominally atheistic state, which allowed to a certain degree the orthodox church to exist, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=312.0s)]
*  but kept it under continual pressure and tried to do everything it could to discourage religious belief. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=320.0s)]
*  He was eventually sent to a prison camp where he ultimately lost his leg, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=327.0s)]
*  and he emerged from that prison camp some years later with a whole trunk full of poetry that he'd written and a wooden peg leg. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=331.0s)]
*  He ended up in a small town in northwestern Russia, Pskov, near the border with Estonia, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=338.0s)]
*  where I visited many times over the course of my reporting and became a really popular and beloved figure in Pskov, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=343.0s)]
*  who everyone seemed to respect, believers and non-believers alike. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=350.0s)]
*  What really worried Pavel and what became his mission later in life was the growing proximity between the orthodox church [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=355.0s)]
*  and the Putin state in the years after Putin took power. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=365.0s)]
*  Putin was very keen to appeal to the orthodox state as an additional pillar of his legitimacy to somehow absorb [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=369.0s)]
*  or use the church's own stature in society to buttress his own. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=379.0s)]
*  You could say the church engaged in the kind of compromise on a large scale or institutional scale [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=384.0s)]
*  that I write about on the scale of the human experience, on the scale of the individual and some of the other characters in my book. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=391.0s)]
*  The church lended its aura of legitimacy to the state in exchange for all sorts of earthly, let's say, benefits here and now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=397.0s)]
*  The church was very much in the hands of the people who were in charge of the state funding, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=409.0s)]
*  having church real estate that had been confiscated by the Soviet Union returned to it, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=416.0s)]
*  the imprimatur of Putin, who would quite publicly go to Easter services and other religious services. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=422.0s)]
*  So it became a very convenient union of church and state, and each got something useful out of it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=429.0s)]
*  There were dangers in that for the church, and that by tying itself to an ultimately earthly politician [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=436.0s)]
*  who can be popular one day, unpopular the other day, who can do things that are perhaps virtuous and just for the population, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=443.0s)]
*  but can do things that are unjust for the population, that the church was risking a great blow to its own esteem [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=451.0s)]
*  and own moral and religious authority. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=459.0s)]
*  He was just about the only priest to speak up about the dangers, as he saw it, of that union. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=462.0s)]
*  In addition to God, the church needs the blessing of Putin. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=468.0s)]
*  Well, if it wants to expand and have the resources to do so, have the real estate to do so, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=473.0s)]
*  to be able to, say, get its teachings or lessons into Russian public schools, to be able to minister in the armed forces, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=483.0s)]
*  there are all sorts of, let's say, earthly privileges that the church needs in order to do its godly mission. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=491.0s)]
*  It's that way for, I suppose, any religion. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=499.0s)]
*  And the Putin state, given its monopolistic hold over life or many aspects and sectors of life in Russia, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=503.0s)]
*  presented exactly that opportunity, I think what ultimately proved too good, too tempting for the church to resist, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=512.0s)]
*  especially after decades of repression and marginalization under the Soviet Union, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=519.0s)]
*  the opportunity for the church to suddenly flourish and have all sorts of resources and opportunities it didn't have for nearly a century, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=525.0s)]
*  I think was too tempting for the church leadership. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=532.0s)]
*  You lay out in the book that really there's no other game in town. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=535.0s)]
*  I mean, the state is such a massive influence on the economy, on whether it's the media, whether it's the church. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=539.0s)]
*  What's the other alternative if you don't want to play ball with the state? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=548.0s)]
*  You know, it's a good question and one I found myself reflecting on over and over in terms of what would I do? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=553.0s)]
*  How would I behave in this situation? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=559.0s)]
*  Would I really be able to say no to the opportunities on offer and pick a much harder and more uncertain life? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=562.0s)]
*  I often came back to something that someone who is a friend of the theater director, Kareel Serebnikov, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=568.0s)]
*  he's another character in the book, really Russia's premier avant-garde experimental director of his age, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=575.0s)]
*  who worked not only on the theater stage, but also in film, who for a while benefited from the Putin state's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=581.0s)]
*  ultimately temporary interest in supporting avant-garde art forms. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=588.0s)]
*  And his fall from grace was quite dramatic. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=593.0s)]
*  He ended up later accused of embezzlement and found himself under house arrest, facing a number of years in prison. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=596.0s)]
*  And as one of his friends was trying to narrate his rise and fall and how did he allow himself to get so close to the state [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=603.0s)]
*  in the first place for someone who, in fact, had no real enthusiasm for the Putin state, quite the opposite. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=610.0s)]
*  Internally, Serebnikov was, I think, an anti-Putinist, it's fair to say, someone whose sympathies lie with the opposition. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=615.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, he did quite well in accepting large amounts of state grants and state resources to make his creative projects. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=622.0s)]
*  And as this friend said to me, you know, in Russia, it's not as if you have a choice of making a film with state money or without state money. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=629.0s)]
*  That would be an easy choice. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=638.0s)]
*  Sure, make the film without state money, do it on your own independently. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=640.0s)]
*  But in Russia, the choice is, do you want to make a film or not? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=644.0s)]
*  And when I understood it that way, I began to look at Serebnikov's predicament differently, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=648.0s)]
*  but also the predicament of lots of people I saw all around me. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=653.0s)]
*  Serebnikov had these talents. He had this vision. He had this experience. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=657.0s)]
*  Why shouldn't he want to realize that in the form of films? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=662.0s)]
*  That's a totally noble, understandable goal. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=666.0s)]
*  And to do that, though, it required this unavoidable, in some senses, inevitable cooperation with the state. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=669.0s)]
*  And I think that's what makes this notion of compromise, which is otherwise universal, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=677.0s)]
*  which I see in my own life and I see in the life of my friends and colleagues, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=683.0s)]
*  gives it a particular Russian cast because the state is so ever-present, really omnipresent in Russia. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=687.0s)]
*  Wherever you turn, whatever your professional field or interest is, you can be an orthodox priest like Pavel Adelgeim [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=695.0s)]
*  or you can be an avant-garde theater director like Kirill Serebnikov. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=702.0s)]
*  Sooner or later, you butt up against the state and have to decide for yourself where and in the service of what am I willing to compromise? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=705.0s)]
*  How much of this do you think serves the state to have a class of people or a group of people who are its critics [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=712.0s)]
*  so that they can point and say, no, I don't own the press. Look at this guy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=722.0s)]
*  He writes horrible stuff about me all the time. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=726.0s)]
*  In the character that you mentioned from the play, he was able to almost create subversive content, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=728.0s)]
*  lay it out on a stage in front of an audience full of high government officials, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=732.0s)]
*  who just kind of watch it and move on with their lives. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=737.0s)]
*  Right. The early years of Putinism especially were almost defined by exactly that dynamic that you highlight. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=741.0s)]
*  There was a kind of big tent aspirational idea behind Putinism that we can have militaristic nationalists and avant-garde theater directors, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=749.0s)]
*  and that's all somehow part of the overall system because that's the ultimately the important thing, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=758.0s)]
*  That the system retains its stability. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=764.0s)]
*  And one way it does so is by a kind of inclusiveness, of course, to a point. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=767.0s)]
*  Someone who's an actual on the street rabble rousing organizer and critic of Putin doesn't necessarily have a place in that tent. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=772.0s)]
*  Someone like Alexei Navalny, who has emerged as the country's most popular opposition leader. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=780.0s)]
*  But that dynamic has narrowed in recent years, and that's shown in the lives of the characters I write about. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=787.0s)]
*  Someone like Serebnikov, the theater director, who for a while was celebrated by the Putin state by given resources, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=793.0s)]
*  and his plays were put on the largest stage stages in Russia, the Bolshoi Theater and others. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=800.0s)]
*  As the window and tolerance of the Putin state for these diverse at some times seemingly quasi oppositional voices has narrowed. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=806.0s)]
*  So too have the opportunities for people like Serebnikov and other people in my book. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=820.0s)]
*  It's actually become harder to do the kinds of compromises that I write about. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=825.0s)]
*  You can't manage your relationship with the state in this kind of nuanced, clever way where you're a little bit in, but not all the way. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=829.0s)]
*  Now the Putin state is really forcing people to choose, and it's possible that strategically, as for the long term stability of that system, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=837.0s)]
*  that's not really an advantageous posture for the state to have. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=844.0s)]
*  Ten years ago I might have asked you the question, do you see Russia becoming more like the U.S.? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=848.0s)]
*  And now I also have to ask the question, do you see the U.S. becoming more like Russia in some ways? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=853.0s)]
*  Sadly, absolutely. Especially, I think here of my time with Konstantin Ernst, the head now of Channel One, Russia's main state network, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=859.0s)]
*  he really narrated to me his own intellectual journey. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=869.0s)]
*  He said to me, in the Soviet times, I, like so many people, were really frustrated by all the limitations of the Soviet state. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=873.0s)]
*  We were young people with ideas and ambitions, and we couldn't realize them, and that angered us. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=883.0s)]
*  And we presumed that everything in the Soviet Union's adversary, the West, America, most of all, somehow must be 180 degrees different there. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=889.0s)]
*  Things should be... [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=900.0s)]
*  Milk and honey. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=902.0s)]
*  Exactly. But then, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the collapse of the Iron Curtain, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=903.0s)]
*  he had the opportunity to travel, to experience America and the West as it actually existed. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=908.0s)]
*  He grew disappointed. It wasn't actually the land of milk and honey, but there are all sorts of problems, deficiencies, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=913.0s)]
*  hypocrisies in America and American foreign policy. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=918.0s)]
*  And his takeaway was to become essentially a cynic about the world at large. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=922.0s)]
*  Every place is just as fallen as the next, and there is no land of milk and honey. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=930.0s)]
*  And I see that kind of thinking creeping in to the American political discourse. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=937.0s)]
*  Each side is equally corrupt. Each side is equally culpable. All facts have equal weight. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=944.0s)]
*  So what's the point in even trying to parse them? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=951.0s)]
*  That's the great and ultimately successful strategy of Channel One and really Russian propaganda in the age of Putin. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=954.0s)]
*  They don't try and convince viewers of Russia's unique and particular greatness. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=962.0s)]
*  Rather, the message is, sure, the Russian state may be corrupt in certain ways. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=966.0s)]
*  Sure, the Russian state may commit this or that violation. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=973.0s)]
*  But look at the violations that America commits. Look at the hypocrisies of Europe. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=977.0s)]
*  Look at the failures of the Western order. We're all equally culpable. We're all equally to blame. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=981.0s)]
*  And there's no real point in trying to isolate or identify one state or another for coming in [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=988.0s)]
*  for a kind of particular or exaggerated blame. And all versions of events carry equal weight. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=994.0s)]
*  I saw that with how Channel One reacted to the shoot down of MH17, a plane flying over eastern Ukraine [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1001.0s)]
*  from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was tragically shot down out of the sky in the summer of 2014. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1008.0s)]
*  We now know it seems pretty clear, based on international investigations led by the Dutch, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1016.0s)]
*  that the plane was shot down by a Russian anti-aircraft system that was given surreptitiously [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1021.0s)]
*  and covertly from the Russian military to the separatists it was backing. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1028.0s)]
*  But on Channel One, you heard all manner of contradictory, even absurd versions about what had happened. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1032.0s)]
*  None of them holding a kind of coherent logic. It couldn't actually be A and B and C [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1039.0s)]
*  because all the versions were contradictory. The point being to leave the viewer in such a state [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1046.0s)]
*  of exhaustion and disorientation that he or she simply threw her hands up and said, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1052.0s)]
*  it's so impossible to make sense of the truth here. I give up. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1058.0s)]
*  And also that Dutch version of events, which seems to be by far the most credible one, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1062.0s)]
*  ends up in that same froth, that same informational soup, and has no more or less weight [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1067.0s)]
*  than all those other absurd versions purposely put out on Channel One to muddy the waters. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1073.0s)]
*  And that kind of purposeful strategic campaign of disorientation and exhaustion of the viewer, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1078.0s)]
*  sadly also is beginning to feel recognizable here in the American media environment. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1085.0s)]
*  All right, Joshua Iafo, Between Two Fires is the book. Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1090.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1095.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0Y36U9Vm9I&t=1103.0s)]
