Video Description: "Stop Russian nuclear terrorism." These were the startling words of Ukrainian President Zelensky after Russian forces fired on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces have occupied the facility, but radiation levels so far appear normal. Rafael Grossi, head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, says today's attack was a close call. He spoke with Christiane by phone just before he caught a flight to Iran amid talks to revive the nuclear deal.

# Rafael Grossi: Attack on a Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant Was "A Close Call" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0)
*  The head of the U.N.'s nuclear wash dog, Rafael Grossi, tells me today's attack was a close call. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=0.0s)]
*  I managed to catch him on the phone just before his flight to Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=6.0s)]
*  Amid talks to try to revive that nuclear deal, he says the Ukrainians are actually [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=9.68s)]
*  still operating their plant, but under stressful circumstances. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=14.48s)]
*  We were in contact through the night with the operators at the plant, with the regulators of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=20.0s)]
*  the Ukraine, myself with the prime minister, talking to all of them, offering assistance. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=28.24s)]
*  And luckily, the situation did not degrade into a nuclear accident. There was no release of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=33.92s)]
*  radioactive material. But of course, it was a close call and an indication of something that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=41.04s)]
*  we have been trying to say over the past few days in the sense that this unprecedented situation [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=46.64s)]
*  of a conflict ongoing in a country that has such a big nuclear infrastructure is, of course, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=53.76s)]
*  something that adds a very concerning element to something which is in and by itself [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=61.92s)]
*  a very great international situation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=69.84s)]
*  Mr. Grossi, what would have happened if one of the reactors had been hit? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=72.16s)]
*  Well, if one would depend on the kind of, of course, impact that you would have. Normally, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=76.72s)]
*  reactors are well prepared to withstand external forces like this or even a plane crash. So, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=86.48s)]
*  there is a good degree of protection. But in a worst-case scenario, what you would have [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=98.08s)]
*  is the release of radioactive material, which is the core of the reactor. So, indeed, a serious [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=104.08s)]
*  situation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Grossi, have you been able to talk to the Russian authorities? You say you were in touch [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=112.4s)]
*  with the Ukrainian authorities. Have you been able to talk to the Russian authorities, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=119.36s)]
*  either ask them what they were targeting and why, and to cease and desist? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=123.84s)]
*  Yes, of course. My normal interlocutor is Ukraine, because this is about Ukrainian [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  facilities. But the realities of the ground, of course, indicate that Russian forces are there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=137.84s)]
*  So, I have to talk to them. And what they maintain is that there is no targeting whatsoever [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=143.84s)]
*  of these facilities. And what happened was an accident. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=150.56s)]
*  So, in any case, what I'm telling them and I'm telling everyone is that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=156.8s)]
*  atmosphere strength should be exercised in and around these types of facilities, because, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=162.96s)]
*  wittingly or unwittingly, you can very quickly go into a disaster. And this is why [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  what we are so concerned. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op-g4a9K1p0&t=186.8s)]
