Video Description: In Iran, there are those still bravely speaking out on issues of human rights, democracy and women's equality. One of these is Narges Mohammadi, a Nobel Peace Laureate who has now been imprisoned for the better part of 20 years. The state accuses her of acting against national security, yet she continues to be a voice for freedom at great personal risk and sacrifice. While out on temporary medical leave, Mohammadi has made the extraordinary decision to speak to Christiane Amanpour with her message to the world, in a world exclusive interview.

# EXCLUSIVE Imprisoned Nobel Peace Laureate Narges Mohammadi Speaks Out  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74)
*  NARGIZ MOHAMMADY, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=6.2s)]
*  You were released from prison for about three weeks in order to recover from an operation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=7.88s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=14.0s)]
*  NARGIZ MOHAMMADY, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=15.0s)]
*  When I was leaving prison, since I was leaving behind my inmates and I had been given release, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=16.0s)]
*  I was feeling very sad. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=28.76s)]
*  I had a heavy heart, and I thought I was leaving behind a part of me, even though it was just [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=31.12s)]
*  for a few days. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=38.44s)]
*  But the moment they let me in the ambulance and I saw the streets, I felt liberated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=40.6s)]
*  And I felt I could see a woman who was crossing the road without a headscarf. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  They recognized me, and they greeted me, and I started chanting woman life freedom. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=56.9s)]
*  And I felt that this is not a movement that is going to lose its strength, and it's still [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=72.74s)]
*  going strong because our women are very strong. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=79.5s)]
*  And I was filled with joy to see our women like that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=83.34s)]
*  And I greeted freedom, because I realized I was not surrounded by guards and I could [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=86.98s)]
*  leave prison. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=95.14s)]
*  But it was I had a kind of dual feeling about leaving prison. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  NARGIZ MOHAMMADY, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  I understand what you're saying, but I'm also I mean, I'm just so amazed that you would [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  be leaving prison for only a period of time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  You're jailed for defying the state, and yet you still come out and you shout the slogan [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=112.54s)]
*  woman life freedom. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=118.54s)]
*  You're on an international television interview right now that will be shown all over the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=120.3s)]
*  world and in the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=125.22s)]
*  And you're still standing up for what you believe in. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=127.26s)]
*  Are you not afraid of the consequences? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=130.58s)]
*  I have been tried for nine times, but, you know, I and I continue to convict me of various [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=133.66s)]
*  crimes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=142.74s)]
*  But I think the path that I have chosen will never stop, not even the prison walls. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=143.74s)]
*  And all these convictions can ever stop me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=151.34s)]
*  And I feel that alongside the Iranian people, I am I have to go towards democracy and equality. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=154.38s)]
*  And I hope that we will see victory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=162.78s)]
*  And it may not be an easy path, but I am determined in my belief because of the conditions that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=165.7s)]
*  exist in my country, Iran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=174.34s)]
*  Nargiz, we are watching the fall of the Assad regime and the evidence of what was left behind [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=176.82s)]
*  in his dungeons, in his prisons, the torture and the killings of political prisoners over [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=184.66s)]
*  many, many years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=191.06s)]
*  So I want to know from you, what is your condition? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=192.94s)]
*  You're a political prisoner in jail in Iran. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  How are you treated there? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=200.02s)]
*  I understand you said that you've been beaten up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=201.78s)]
*  You have had multiple heart attacks. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=205.18s)]
*  You're a young woman, but nonetheless, you've had multiple heart attacks. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=207.62s)]
*  How are you treated? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=211.06s)]
*  I do not want to compare the prisons of the Islamic Republic of Iran with those of the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=212.74s)]
*  Assad regime because Assad has been toppled and now the dungeons have been opened and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=224.66s)]
*  people have seen how the situation was. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=233.78s)]
*  Whereas the prisons in Iran, Kurdistan, Sistan, Baluchistan, Khuzestan, the doors are still [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=237.82s)]
*  locked and we have no information about what is happening there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=246.26s)]
*  So I can speak about my experiences in Zanjan and Garchak prison, the experience we had [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=251.54s)]
*  in the IRGC cells, in the security cells and in solitary confinement. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=258.18s)]
*  They are very, very tragic experiences. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=265.06s)]
*  There have been prisoners who've been isolated from everyone. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=270.3s)]
*  They have been in solitary confinement. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=274.98s)]
*  They have been isolated from society and they're even unaware of their own case files. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  There are people who have been in solitary confinement for a long time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=284.18s)]
*  As a result, they have suffered from physical ailments and are still suffering. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=289.26s)]
*  And there are some who have actually died in solitary confinement and nobody knows what's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=296.02s)]
*  happened and what happened to their case files. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=302.26s)]
*  There are many such files. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=305.9s)]
*  There are not just a few. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=307.18s)]
*  So we've been witnessing very disconcerting situations. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=309.18s)]
*  Perhaps once they open prison doors in Iran, we will see much more. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=312.86s)]
*  Have you specifically, have you been physically abused? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=318.58s)]
*  Your lawyer said that you've been beaten up or badly beaten. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=321.46s)]
*  Yes, on several occasions I was beaten up. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  In about 2019, from 1.30 to 5.30 in the afternoon when I was in the prison yard, I was beaten [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  up very badly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  My whole body was covered in bruises and injuries. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-G6PbLrL74&t=350.7s)]
