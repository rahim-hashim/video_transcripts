Video Description: Today, the International Criminal Court’s Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan told Christiane he is seeking warrants for three Hamas leaders -- Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri -- for crimes committed during the October 7th attacks on Israel, when more than 1200 Israelis were killed and hundreds more were kidnapped. The court is also seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, citing the war in Gaza that has seen more than 35,000 deaths and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The prosecutor tells Christiane this is no witch hunt, nor is it political. The ICC is carrying out its mandate to apply justice equally and without fear nor favor. Israelis from across the political spectrum have denounced this decision. Netanyahu called the warrants an “outrage” that won’t deter Israel from continuing its war. Hamas also is rejecting the charges against its leadership. Karim Khan explains his decision to Christiane in an exclusive interview.

# EXCLUSIVE ICC Prosecutor Seeks Arrest Warrants for Netanyahu & Hamas Leaders  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw)
*  Prosecutor Karim Khan, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=3.0s)]
*  And of course we're here at the ICC. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=4.0s)]
*  You are today announcing that you are applying for arrest warrants [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=7.0s)]
*  for top military and political leadership in the Israel-Gaza war [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=13.0s)]
*  since the October 7th events. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=20.0s)]
*  First and foremost, explain to me exactly what you're asking for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=22.0s)]
*  and who you are charging. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=26.0s)]
*  Today, Christiane, we've applied for warrants to the pretrial chamber [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=29.0s)]
*  of the International Criminal Court in relation to three individuals [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=33.0s)]
*  that are Hamas members. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=38.0s)]
*  Sinwa, who's in charge on the ground. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=40.0s)]
*  That's Yahya Sinwa. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=42.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=43.0s)]
*  Dave, who's in charge of the Al-Qasim Brigade. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=44.0s)]
*  And Hanir, who's one of their political bureau based in Doha. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=49.0s)]
*  Let me just, for everybody to understand, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=53.0s)]
*  Yahya Sinwa is the head of what they call the Islamic Resistance Movement, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=55.0s)]
*  Hamas, the military operation or even wider. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=59.0s)]
*  Mohammad Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, otherwise known as Dave, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=62.0s)]
*  commander in chief of the military wing's Al-Qasim Brigade. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=66.0s)]
*  And Ismail Hanir, head of the Hamas political bureau. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=69.0s)]
*  What are the charges? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=74.0s)]
*  The charges are extermination, murder, taking of hostages, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=76.0s)]
*  rape and sexual assault in detention. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=81.0s)]
*  So these are the key crimes that are alleged to have been committed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=84.0s)]
*  by these three individuals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=90.0s)]
*  The world was shocked on the 7th of October when people were ripped [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=92.0s)]
*  from their bedrooms, from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=95.0s)]
*  And people have suffered enormously. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=100.0s)]
*  And we have a variety of evidence to support the applications [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=103.0s)]
*  that we've submitted to the judges. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=106.0s)]
*  And just tell us what the evidence is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=108.0s)]
*  Obviously the world has seen the real-time images. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=110.0s)]
*  The Israeli government has put out videos, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=115.0s)]
*  which is shared to the UN and others, journalists, about what happened. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=117.0s)]
*  There are body cams on many of the Hamas fighters, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=122.0s)]
*  whoever was there at the time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=126.0s)]
*  Is that the evidence or do you have more? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=128.0s)]
*  We have more. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=130.0s)]
*  We have authenticated videos and photographs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=132.0s)]
*  We have CCTV, camera pictures. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=135.0s)]
*  We have eyewitness evidence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=139.0s)]
*  We have evidence of survivors. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=142.0s)]
*  I mean, it's remarkable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=144.0s)]
*  The victims and survivors from Israel that have engaged with my office [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=146.0s)]
*  have this righteous demand for justice and accountability. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=150.0s)]
*  They've come here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=155.0s)]
*  I've also met them in the different kibbutzim, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=157.0s)]
*  and they want justice and accountability. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=159.0s)]
*  So we have also expert evidence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=162.0s)]
*  So there's a whole variety of information that we have authenticated [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=164.0s)]
*  that we think is relevant and probative [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=168.0s)]
*  and that is sufficient, we say, to sustain the crimes [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=170.0s)]
*  that we put forward to the judges. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=173.0s)]
*  You have also issued warrants against the top political [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=175.0s)]
*  and military leadership of the government of the State of Israel. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=179.0s)]
*  We've applied for warrants. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=183.0s)]
*  Of course, the judges must determine whether or not to issue them, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=185.0s)]
*  but we've applied today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=188.0s)]
*  We'll apply for warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=190.0s)]
*  and also Minister of Defense Galant [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=194.0s)]
*  for the crimes of causing extermination, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=197.0s)]
*  causing starvation as a method of war, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=203.0s)]
*  including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=207.0s)]
*  deliberately targeting civilians in conflict. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=210.0s)]
*  And the sad thing really is in relation to both categories. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=214.0s)]
*  I have been saying repeatedly in Cairo in October last year [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=219.0s)]
*  at the Rafa crossing, on Israeli television, in Ramallah, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=226.0s)]
*  everywhere I can to the parties to the conflict comply now, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=231.0s)]
*  don't complain later. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=237.0s)]
*  And of course, hostages have not been released. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=239.0s)]
*  That's an insidious crime. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=242.0s)]
*  It continues for so many innocent Israelis that are in custody. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=244.0s)]
*  I held hostage by Hamas and families that are waiting for their return. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=250.0s)]
*  And of course, we see pictures of starving children, of emaciated children. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=255.0s)]
*  We have a variety of evidence to support, not polemics, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=260.0s)]
*  but evidence that's been forensically analyzed to sustain the charge also [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=265.0s)]
*  of starvation being used by Netanyahu and Galant as a method of war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=269.0s)]
*  And it's awful that in 2024 we have had to submit these applications [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=274.0s)]
*  to the judges of the ICC for warrants. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=278.0s)]
*  I'm going to get into starvation as a weapon of war in a moment. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=280.0s)]
*  But first I want to ask you, the word genocide has been used by both sides, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=283.0s)]
*  and many believe that genocide is being committed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=289.0s)]
*  But you do not. You're not using that word. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=293.0s)]
*  Well, this is an active investigation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=296.0s)]
*  We have criminal charges that we can use, genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=298.0s)]
*  In relation to this current stage of investigations, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=305.0s)]
*  the charges that we have put forward to the judges do not include genocide. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=308.0s)]
*  But we are continuing to investigate. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=313.0s)]
*  It's a very complex situation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=315.0s)]
*  We've not been allowed access into Gaza by the Israeli authorities. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=317.0s)]
*  We're also continuing our investigations in relation to the Hamas attacks. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=320.0s)]
*  And if and when the evidence points us in a particular direction, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=325.0s)]
*  we will not hesitate to act. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=329.0s)]
*  So it's still an active investigation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=330.0s)]
*  But yes, today we haven't. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=332.0s)]
*  What is extermination? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=334.0s)]
*  It's mass killing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=336.0s)]
*  Different than genocide? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=338.0s)]
*  Yes. Genocide is defined by specific intent. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=339.0s)]
*  Not only killing, but an intention to destroy the group in whole or in part. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=342.0s)]
*  It's a specific intent to destroy the group in whole or in part. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=348.0s)]
*  We have not included in our application today a request for warrants for the crime of genocide. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpcY5OongTw&t=352.0s)]
