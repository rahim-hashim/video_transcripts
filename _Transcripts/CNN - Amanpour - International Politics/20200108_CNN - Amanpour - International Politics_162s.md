# Defense Secretary Mark Esper: “We Are Not Looking to Start a War with Iran” | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY)
*  The administration has talked about an imminent threat, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=0.0s)]
*  and that is what led to this strike. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=2.7s)]
*  As you know, many well-plugged-in officials, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=4.94s)]
*  people who apparently have had access [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=8.44s)]
*  to the intelligence briefings even after the strike, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=10.08s)]
*  have reported to our colleagues [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=13.22s)]
*  that the evidence may be razor thin [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=16.18s)]
*  and that chatter was nothing out of the ordinary [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=18.42s)]
*  for what you already know about Soleimani [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=21.22s)]
*  and his plans and activities. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=23.82s)]
*  So I guess, can you look the American people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=26.22s)]
*  and the world down the barrel of this camera [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  straight in the eye and say that there was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  a ticking time bomb evidence? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=33.56s)]
*  Well, thank you, Christiane. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=37.26s)]
*  First of all, let me send a few messages [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=38.44s)]
*  to the American people in the broader world. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=40.2s)]
*  First of all, to the American people, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=42.28s)]
*  I want to assure them that they have [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=43.6s)]
*  the best military in the world, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=45.2s)]
*  and the young men and women who wear our uniform [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  of any service are extremely capable and professional [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=49.18s)]
*  and prepared to defend our homeland, our people, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=52.18s)]
*  and our interests in the region and more broadly. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Secondly, I'd like to say to our service members [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=58.06s)]
*  and our diplomats in the region that we have your back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=60.56s)]
*  We thoroughly support what you're doing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=63.46s)]
*  We're proud of you and that we are taking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=65.7s)]
*  every necessary step to ensure force protection [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=67.74s)]
*  as I know you ready yourself for what may be ahead. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  Thirdly, to our partners and allies [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=74.14s)]
*  and directly to the Iranian regime, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=75.7s)]
*  I'd like to say we are not looking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=77.1s)]
*  to start a war with Iran, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=78.8s)]
*  but we are prepared to finish one. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  As I've told my many colleagues, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=82.58s)]
*  as I've spoke to them over the last few days, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  what we'd like to see is this situation de-escalated [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=87.2s)]
*  and for Tehran to sit down with us [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=89.86s)]
*  and begin a discussion about a better way ahead. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=91.36s)]
*  We think that's the best approach at this point in time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=93.94s)]
*  Now, Christiane, with regard to your question [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=97.24s)]
*  about the intelligence, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=99.18s)]
*  I can assure you that it's more than razor thin [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=100.82s)]
*  and it's persuasive. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=103.08s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=106.68s)]
*  Soleimani was caught red-handed on the ground in Baghdad. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=108.42s)]
*  One terrorist leader of a terrorist organization [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=112.12s)]
*  meeting with another terrorist leader [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=114.32s)]
*  to synchronize and plan additional attacks [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=116.72s)]
*  on American forces, diplomats, or facilities. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=119.22s)]
*  I think we took the right action [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  to remove these players from the battlefield. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  So, ticking time bomb imminent threat, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=126.34s)]
*  is that what you're saying? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=128.8s)]
*  I think the threat was being orchestrated by Soleimani. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=131.34s)]
*  That's what the intelligence reported. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  That's what he was doing on the ground [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  in both Baghdad and Damascus and elsewhere. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  And I think it was only a matter of days, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=142.54s)]
*  certainly no more than weeks. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSLEIzCTjRY&t=145.42s)]
