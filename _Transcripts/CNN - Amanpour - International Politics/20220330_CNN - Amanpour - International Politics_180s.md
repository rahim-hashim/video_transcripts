# Adm. Kirby: "Putin Wants To Gain Leverage At The Negotiating Table" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE)
*  And, and, and, John, we've obviously been around and out and about, I have, and so have my colleagues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=0.0s)]
*  We, we, we heard and we saw the heavy bombardments that are going around various parts just on the outskirts of the Capitol. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=5.0s)]
*  And we've seen what's happened in Chernihiv, a lot of what the mayor there calls a colossal bombing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=12.5s)]
*  But I want to ask you this, because, you know, I guess, why do you think there's all this fighting going on now, from a military point of view, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=18.5s)]
*  as you say and they say, they're probably going to redirect forces elsewhere and probably to Donbass? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=28.0s)]
*  I think it's a couple of things, Christiane. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=35.0s)]
*  Number one, I think Mr. Putin wants to gain leverage at the negotiating table. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=37.0s)]
*  So they met yesterday in Istanbul. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=41.0s)]
*  The Russians said that, you know, it was a constructive conversation, but nothing was really agreed to. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=43.0s)]
*  We think it's the Russian play to try to bargain for more leverage, which is why they're continuing the onslaught on some of these city centers, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=49.0s)]
*  Karkiv, Chernihiv, Kiev, Mariupol, which is still under the threat of significant airstrikes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=56.0s)]
*  We also think that what they're trying to do in the east, a couple of things. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=63.0s)]
*  One, try to fix and hold Ukrainian armed forces that are there in the Joint Forces Operations Area [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=67.0s)]
*  so that they can't come to the aid of their colleagues further west in the country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=73.0s)]
*  And number two, so that they can carve off that Donbass. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=77.0s)]
*  Now, it's not clear whether he wants it to own it, occupy it and annex it forever [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=80.0s)]
*  or whether he's trying to be able to achieve some level of success on the ground there [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=85.0s)]
*  so that he can use that as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=90.0s)]
*  But you heard Mr. Yermuk yourself. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=93.0s)]
*  The Ukrainians are not willing to give up their sovereignty. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=95.0s)]
*  They're not willing to give up one inch of their territory, nor should they have to. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=97.0s)]
*  What really needs to happen is Mr. Putin needs to sit down at the table in good faith now [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=100.0s)]
*  rather than trying to bargain or leverage himself for more opportunity later on. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=105.0s)]
*  And yet he does, and yet their forces still continue to bombard certainly places in the south. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=112.0s)]
*  I mean, the government here and people are just absolutely beside themselves [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=118.0s)]
*  about what's happening in Mariupol. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=122.0s)]
*  It is a terrible, terrible thing to be witnessing even from afar. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=124.0s)]
*  Clearly that plays into what you just alluded to, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=128.0s)]
*  and they're trying actually to carve out that whole area for themselves. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=131.0s)]
*  And who's going to stop them? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=135.0s)]
*  Well, the Ukrainians are fighting bravely in Mariupol, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=137.0s)]
*  and we are continuing to make sure that we get them as much defensive systems as we can, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=140.0s)]
*  as fast as we can. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=145.0s)]
*  And they are defending it very bravely, but you're right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=147.0s)]
*  We think Mariupol is important just because it's a big port city on the Sea of Azzab, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=150.0s)]
*  and there's no question about that, but it sits at the southern end of that Donbass region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=154.0s)]
*  And so we think they definitely, Russians want it so that they can again carve off that eastern part of Ukraine. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSHeYclwGE&t=158.0s)]
