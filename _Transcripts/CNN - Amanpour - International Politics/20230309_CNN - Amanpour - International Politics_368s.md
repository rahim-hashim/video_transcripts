Video Description: Originally aired on March 1, 2023.

The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog has found near bomb-grade levels of uranium at a nuclear facility in Iran. CNN has seen a restricted report revealing the presence of uranium particles enriched to almost 84% -- very close to the 90% needed to make a nuclear bomb. The discovery comes amid alarming allegations of human rights violations by Iran's regime against protesters, and shocking accounts of torture and sexual assault at the hands of the Revolutionary Guards. Meanwhile, Iran is also suspected of sending attack drones to Russia for Putin’s war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian is in Geneva this week speaking at the U.N. Human Rights Council. In a rare interview, the first since the death of Mahsa Aminia rocked the country, Christiane sat down with the foreign minister for a challenging conversation.

# Amanpour to Iranian FM: “What Do the Women in Your Family Say to You?” | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo)
*  I want to talk about your country. So what I want to understand is, are you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=0.0s)]
*  therefore saying that killing innocent protesters, sexually abusing and raping [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=5.12s)]
*  women who have been arrested, as we CNN have spoken to at least one woman who [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=12.88s)]
*  says that, in a Revolutionary Guard detention center, summary trials, mass [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=19.04s)]
*  detentions of peaceful protesters, I'm talking about peaceful protesters now, is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=28.08s)]
*  that Iran's standard for implementing human rights? That's what I want to know. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=33.8s)]
*  In Iran we had an incident. An Iranian girl passed away and we were all very [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=41.24s)]
*  sorry about that. But foreign interference and the Persian language media that are [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  based in the United States and Britain focused their activities on encouraging [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=56.36s)]
*  and instigating the riots and acts of terror. And that's why peaceful protests [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=60.68s)]
*  ended up becoming violent, because of the foreign intervention. To the extent that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=65.48s)]
*  even Daesh or ISIS exploited the situation to establish a presence in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=70.48s)]
*  Iran. And I can tell you this in full confidence, that our police and the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=75.0s)]
*  security forces in Iran have not killed anyone with bullets or any other means [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=79.72s)]
*  in these riots. In fact, the police, they were not even given permission to use [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=84.24s)]
*  firearms. On the contrary, over a hundred police officers were actually attacked [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=88.88s)]
*  by people who had all kinds of firearms and weapons they had procured from the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=94.32s)]
*  unsafe borders of neighboring countries. They were martyred and thousands of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=98.16s)]
*  police were injured. And some foreign elements and the Persian language media [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=103.36s)]
*  that are financially supported and led by them, claimed that there was a new [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=107.84s)]
*  revolution and claimed that a coup d'etat is being staged in Iran. And who [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=111.88s)]
*  was going to lead this? The head of the terrorist mini group, MEK. The hypocrites, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=117.96s)]
*  which has martyred 17,000 Iranians, women and children. And they have been on the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=123.16s)]
*  US and Western terrorist blacklists for many years. And then there's the son of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=128.32s)]
*  the former Shah, who has committed many crimes. And I said to the authorities in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=133.56s)]
*  Germany, would you allow a son of Hitler if he had any children to become [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=138.04s)]
*  chancellor in Germany today? Are you really seriously drawing that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  comparison? Yes, of course. That's what I told the Germans. All right. So that's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  your position. You say that they're terrorists. You did say that there were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=150.72s)]
*  peaceful protests. I want to talk about the peaceful protests because those are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  the people who have also been arrested, have also been killed. And essentially [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=159.12s)]
*  repression has worked. We've seen summary executions of at least four [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=165.84s)]
*  people and the protests are less than they were. But I want to ask you to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=170.0s)]
*  respond. I want to ask you to respond to the fact when you say the Islamic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=174.84s)]
*  Republic of Iran respects human rights, one female protester says that she was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=180.36s)]
*  detained inside a Revolutionary Guard facility for more than a month and raped [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=187.08s)]
*  by three different men. She went to a cleric, a mullah afterwards, because she [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=192.32s)]
*  was having suicide thoughts. She was so upset. CNN spoke with that cleric. Is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=196.92s)]
*  that acceptable? Is it acceptable for a woman, whatever she's done, to be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=203.8s)]
*  arrested and raped? And there are many, many, many reports of sexual abuse in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=209.04s)]
*  this situation against women and men. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=217.24s)]
*  Firstly, in the peaceful demonstrations in the fall, no one was arrested. So [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=220.24s)]
*  you're just denying that? However, in those protests that had become violent, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=224.96s)]
*  some individuals, some of whom who had entered Iran from the outside and were [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=230.88s)]
*  using firearms and killing the police were arrested. You do know that the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=234.88s)]
*  Supreme Leader actually issued an amnesty and all those who were imprisoned [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=239.16s)]
*  were released, with the exception of those who had killed someone or were [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=243.56s)]
*  being sued. Regarding the Iranian woman that you mentioned, I cannot confirm it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=246.84s)]
*  There have been so many such baseless claims made on social media and in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=252.44s)]
*  media. Okay, these are not baseless and they weren't on the internet. CNN spoke [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  to a cleric, a religious person inside your country and got this story. We have [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=261.68s)]
*  seen some of CNN's reports that are targeted and false. That's not true. We [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  report the facts and we report the truth. And that's why you're sitting here [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=272.8s)]
*  with me, Mr. Foreign Minister. Can we move on? I want to ask you, you have a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=276.32s)]
*  wife, you may have sisters, do you have daughters? I want to know what you think [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=281.0s)]
*  about peaceful protests for change in the way women are able to live their [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=286.04s)]
*  lives in Iran. The peaceful act of removing a scarf. What do they say to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=292.36s)]
*  you, the women in your family? What do they say to you? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=297.6s)]
*  First of all, I would like to say that in Iran we have the strongest democracy, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=301.28s)]
*  especially compared to many other countries. There are standards and rules [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=308.68s)]
*  and regulations in every country and the women have an important role in Iran. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=313.28s)]
*  And they gained that role after the victory of the Islamic Revolution in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=318.24s)]
*  Iran. Today, the outside networks, they are turning the issue of hijab and head [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=321.52s)]
*  scarf into a political crisis. Women in Iran, within the framework of rules and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=327.6s)]
*  regulations, enjoy extraordinary freedoms. See, the thing is, I kind of know about [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=332.6s)]
*  this. So I also know that at the beginning of the revolution, there was no [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=337.32s)]
*  head job mandate. Those who wanted to wear a head job in a chador could, those [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=341.24s)]
*  who didn't want to didn't. Only several months or maybe a year after did the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=345.44s)]
*  Ayatollah say no, all you women have to go under the head job. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIts1zmmoxo&t=349.76s)]
