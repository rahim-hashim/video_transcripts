*  Dr. Amani? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=43.52s)]
*  She's the first woman leading, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  what, a staff of 140 people in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=46.82s)]
*  this underground hospital. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=48.56s)]
*  How did you settle on this? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  When we start, when we continue [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  shooting, we, I find out there [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=52.72s)]
*  is something special with Dr. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=56.36s)]
*  Amani because I kept talking to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=57.72s)]
*  her and find out, like, she's, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=59.36s)]
*  she have a very, very special [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=61.82s)]
*  way of leading the hospital and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=64.46s)]
*  then I figure out that she's the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=67.06s)]
*  first woman to lead a hospital [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=68.52s)]
*  in history of Syria. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=70.02s)]
*  But she was also helping the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=71.82s)]
*  woman to work in the hospital. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=73.52s)]
*  She built a rule of equality. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=75.32s)]
*  She built a space for this woman [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=77.92s)]
*  to find their identity and this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=80.12s)]
*  is what the culture doing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=81.62s)]
*  What Dr. Amani doing, it's really [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=83.5s)]
*  rare, but it's brave in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=85.56s)]
*  a different level. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  And she is doing this in a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=88.62s)]
*  culture that's been very [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=90.42s)]
*  chauvinistic and sexist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=91.52s)]
*  There's a clip of that in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=93.1s)]
*  film I want to show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  Did you find any of this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=178.05999999999997s)]
*  pervading the film making process, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=180.66s)]
*  meaning you have camera people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=182.7s)]
*  who are there when they're [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  shooting, are they thinking about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=185.5s)]
*  her as the character or are they [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=187.82s)]

*  the challenging in the films [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=193.7s)]
*  because I want to focus on the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=195.11999999999998s)]

*  for the woman in the war, not as [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=201.66s)]
*  a victim, but also as an active [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=204.26s)]

*  bit away. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=263.84s)]
*  And you can capture a lot of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=264.94s)]
*  things. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  And this footage start to come [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=266.88s)]
*  out and then themselves start to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=268.28s)]
*  change, start to see her as [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=270.14s)]

*  She's great. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=279.62s)]
*  And what she doing that they [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=280.38s)]
*  never noticed it before. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=281.68s)]
*  They start to notice it through [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=283.48s)]
*  the camera. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=284.48s)]
*  But also what the camera did [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=284.92s)]
*  actually, it's built the respect [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=286.22s)]
*  around Dr. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=288.02s)]
*  Amani. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=288.58s)]

*  focus on her and see her like [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=291.72s)]
*  something important. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=293.42s)]
*  Partly because the camera was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=294.86s)]
*  there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=296.02s)]
*  Because the camera was there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=296.42s)]
*  That's what the power of the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=297.42s)]
*  change that the cinema can do in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3EflxYGx8&t=300.7s)]
