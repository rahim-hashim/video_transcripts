# Nanfu Wang 2020 MacArthur Fellow on Her Film One Child Nation  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [August 08, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU)
*  Now, from that intersection of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=0.0s)]
*  faith and politics to one [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1.94s)]
*  between politics and family, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=3.7s)]
*  with our next guest, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=5.34s)]
*  filmmaker Nanfu Wang. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=6.4s)]
*  She's using her lens to capture [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=8.4s)]
*  the devastating cost of China's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=10.14s)]
*  one-child policy for her new [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=12.18s)]
*  film, One Child Nation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  It won the Grand Jury Prize at [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=16.38s)]
*  Sundance, and it comes out this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=18.14s)]
*  Friday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=19.78s)]
*  Nanfu Wang sat down with our [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=20.52s)]
*  Hari Sreenivasan to talk about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  this phenomenon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=23.82s)]
*  So, first, let's just talk about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=25.76s)]
*  the one-child policy for people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=27.3s)]
*  who don't know it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=29.18s)]
*  The Chinese government says that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=30.38s)]
*  they prevented 380 million [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=32.02s)]
*  births. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=35.76s)]
*  How does a state pull something [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=36.82s)]
*  like that off? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=39.26s)]
*  Well, the 380 million is actually [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=41.0s)]
*  a number that was released years [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=43.6s)]
*  ago, like decades ago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=46.2s)]
*  So the number is much, the real [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=47.5s)]
*  number is much, much higher than [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=49.34s)]
*  that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=51.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's a country [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=52.04s)]
*  with a billion people, and the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=53.64s)]
*  policy was enforced throughout [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  And almost every woman I know, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  my mom's generation, even my [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=63.38s)]
*  grandma's generation, my grandma [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=65.14s)]
*  was one of the first generation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=67.38s)]
*  in the village who got first [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=69.22s)]
*  sterilization. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=70.98s)]
*  Every woman basically had gone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=72.22s)]
*  through either forced abortion [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  or definitely forced [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=76.86s)]
*  sterilization. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=78.26s)]
*  So because the policy ran for, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=79.36s)]
*  what, 35 years? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=80.56s)]
*  Yes, over 35 years. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=81.76s)]
*  So it affected multiple [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  generations of childbearing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=84.7s)]
*  women. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=86.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  And if a woman did not want a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=87.34s)]
*  forced sterilization or an [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=89.02s)]
*  abortion, what happened? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=90.42s)]
*  That's what is called a forced. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  On every level of the government, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=95.66s)]
*  there is village, town, city, and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=97.8s)]
*  province, there are family [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  planning officials. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=101.74s)]
*  Their entire job responsibility [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=103.34s)]
*  is to find out whether a woman [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=105.44s)]
*  is pregnant with a second child [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=107.74s)]
*  or not and who had just had a [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=109.88s)]
*  baby and making sure that once a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=112.28s)]
*  woman has had a child, then the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=115.12s)]
*  next thing they would do is to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=117.78s)]
*  sterilize that woman. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=119.48s)]
*  All right, let's take a look at [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=121.24s)]
*  a clip from your trailer. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=122.38s)]
*  None of my family questioned the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=124.08s)]
*  policy or how it was implemented. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=125.78s)]
*  Chinese government would come in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=147.72s)]
*  and they'd bash down your house, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=149.72s)]
*  take the child. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=151.72s)]
*  Throughout my life, I was taught [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=177.72s)]
*  to believe the love of my country [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=179.72s)]
*  was equal to love of the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=181.72s)]
*  government and the party. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=183.72s)]
*  I was so angry, even with my own [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=185.72s)]
*  family, that there wasn't more to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=187.72s)]
*  be said or done. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=189.72s)]
*  The Chinese government, their [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=191.72s)]
*  rationale for this was what? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=193.72s)]
*  China has too many people and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=195.72s)]
*  they are starving. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=197.72s)]
*  There wasn't enough food and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=199.72s)]
*  resources for so many people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=201.72s)]
*  So they had to control the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=203.72s)]
*  population and the way to do it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=205.72s)]
*  is to have fewer people in each [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=207.72s)]
*  family. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=209.72s)]
*  That's when they came up with the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=211.72s)]
*  idea of each family should just [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=213.72s)]
*  be allowed to have one child. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=215.72s)]
*  And they haven't anticipated the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=217.72s)]
*  consequences of implementing the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=219.72s)]
*  policy in such a massive country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=221.72s)]
*  You interviewed the midwife who [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=223.72s)]
*  delivered you, right? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=225.72s)]
*  But she's also performed these [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=227.72s)]
*  sterilizations and she's saying [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=229.72s)]
*  this out loud on camera. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=231.72s)]
*  And she's even admitting to worse. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=233.72s)]
*  Yeah, that was an interview that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=235.72s)]
*  really surprised me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=237.72s)]
*  I wanted to know from her, she's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=239.72s)]
*  84 years old and she delivered [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=241.72s)]
*  every baby in my village, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=243.72s)]
*  including myself. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=245.72s)]
*  So I went to see her and I asked [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=247.72s)]
*  her a very simple question. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=249.72s)]
*  I was like, how many babies do you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=251.72s)]
*  think you delivered in your whole [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=253.72s)]
*  life? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=255.72s)]
*  And she said, oh, I don't remember [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=257.72s)]
*  that number, but I do remember [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=259.72s)]
*  I had done 50 to 60,000 abortions [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=261.72s)]
*  to the women like throughout my [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=263.72s)]
*  career. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=265.72s)]
*  And that was completely shocking [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=267.72s)]
*  when on the one hand of her [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=269.72s)]
*  openness and on the second hand is [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=271.72s)]
*  like, you know, how the number [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=273.72s)]
*  since she's only a midwife in the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=275.72s)]
*  village and there are midwives, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=277.72s)]
*  you know, in the city, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=279.72s)]
*  throughout the country, there are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=281.72s)]
*  thousands of people like her. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=283.72s)]
*  And that number is like, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=285.72s)]
*  it's like, it's like, it's like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=287.72s)]
*  thousands of people like her. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=289.72s)]
*  And that number completely shocked me. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=291.72s)]
*  And it's sterilizations and abortions. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=293.72s)]
*  And that's over a period [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=295.72s)]
*  of 30 years? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=297.72s)]
*  28 years, I believe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=299.72s)]
*  And how is there, do they keep all [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=301.72s)]
*  these records of all of these? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=303.72s)]
*  She did the math for me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=305.72s)]
*  So the way that she would do [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=307.72s)]
*  is because the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=309.72s)]
*  midwife and the medical officials were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=311.72s)]
*  in demand. So through [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=313.72s)]
*  January to June, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=315.72s)]
*  like every day for six months, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=317.72s)]
*  she would travel in a bus, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=319.72s)]
*  like among other midwives [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=321.72s)]
*  across the county, the region, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=323.72s)]
*  and like work seven [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=325.72s)]
*  days a week. They would take from [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=327.72s)]
*  town to town. And every day [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=329.72s)]
*  they would be at a place and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=331.72s)]
*  the officials would just bring [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=333.72s)]
*  women to that space. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=335.72s)]
*  And she would perform one sterilization. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=337.72s)]
*  Each one takes 10 to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=339.72s)]
*  15 minutes. And then [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=341.72s)]
*  she would have, in June, she would have two [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=343.72s)]
*  weeks of vacation. And then [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=345.72s)]
*  from after that to December, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=347.72s)]
*  she would be on the road [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=349.72s)]
*  again and do this every day. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=351.72s)]
*  And then she would have two weeks for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=353.72s)]
*  the New Year. And she did [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=355.72s)]
*  this for almost three decades. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=357.72s)]
*  She described that they were like [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=359.72s)]
*  almost tied like pigs to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=361.72s)]
*  brought to her. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=363.72s)]
*  I'm sorry, they were brought like what? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=365.72s)]
*  The women were tied up like sometimes [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=367.72s)]
*  with ropes and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=369.72s)]
*  almost like they tied pigs. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=371.72s)]
*  Yeah, when they brought to her to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=373.72s)]
*  operate. Because these are women who [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=375.72s)]
*  did not consent. Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=377.72s)]
*  And they had to be sterilized. Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=379.72s)]
*  She's also describing really [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=381.72s)]
*  late term abortions. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=383.72s)]
*  And she's describing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=385.72s)]
*  actually taking the life. Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=387.72s)]
*  Of children after they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=389.72s)]
*  are out. Yeah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=391.72s)]
*  One thing that she [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=393.72s)]
*  said to me, and she [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=395.72s)]
*  was really painful when she said that, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=397.72s)]
*  was, you know, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=399.72s)]
*  when she performed all those abortions [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=401.72s)]
*  as a middle wife, sometimes [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=403.72s)]
*  the babies were born [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=405.72s)]
*  nine month pregnancy. They were born alive. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=409.72s)]
*  And because of the policy [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=411.72s)]
*  and her job, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=413.72s)]
*  she had to kill them after they were [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=415.72s)]
*  born alive. And [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=417.72s)]
*  she [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=419.72s)]
*  is really traumatized by [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=421.72s)]
*  that. So today, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=423.72s)]
*  she's living with the guilt and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=425.72s)]
*  trauma. And then she decided to only [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=427.72s)]
*  treat infertility disorders. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=429.72s)]
*  She believed [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=431.72s)]
*  that if she can now help a couple [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=433.72s)]
*  to bring a baby [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=435.72s)]
*  to the world, she can kind of like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=437.72s)]
*  Atone? Yeah, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=439.72s)]
*  return her sins. In [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=441.72s)]
*  2016, the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=443.72s)]
*  one child policy ended. So [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=445.72s)]
*  right now is two child policy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=447.72s)]
*  And the government has realized [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=449.72s)]
*  over the past almost [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=451.72s)]
*  40 years, the country [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=453.72s)]
*  now is facing the lack of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=455.72s)]
*  workforce and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=457.72s)]
*  rapidly aging society. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=459.72s)]
*  And there is a lack of, you know, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=461.72s)]
*  young people to work and to care for [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=463.72s)]
*  the elderly. Ironically, the same [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=465.72s)]
*  kind of propaganda [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=467.72s)]
*  slogans are being used. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=469.72s)]
*  And the same kind of [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=471.72s)]
*  tactics, fines, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=473.72s)]
*  money incentives are being used [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=475.72s)]
*  to encourage people to have more children. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=477.72s)]
*  It's almost like it's opening [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=479.72s)]
*  a new chapter, but with the same [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=481.72s)]
*  language and tactics of one [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=483.72s)]
*  child policy. Let's take a look at some of the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=485.72s)]
*  tactics and another clip we have here. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=487.72s)]
*  Men like Liu Xianwen worked all over [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=489.72s)]
*  China to promote the one child [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=491.72s)]
*  policy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=493.72s)]
*  Since before I could even [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=495.72s)]
*  speak, I was surrounded [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=497.72s)]
*  by messages praising the policy. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=499.72s)]
*  There [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=501.72s)]
*  was TV, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=503.72s)]
*  theatrical performances, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=511.72s)]
*  and even [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=515.72s)]
*  children's songs. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=517.72s)]
*  Your family, your mom, your [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=545.72s)]
*  aunts, relatives, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=547.72s)]
*  all still support [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=549.72s)]
*  the government's position that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=551.72s)]
*  this [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=553.72s)]
*  was necessary [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=555.72s)]
*  and frankly that it worked. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=557.72s)]
*  Yeah, when I [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=559.72s)]
*  talked to my mom and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=561.72s)]
*  my whole family, and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=563.72s)]
*  they were like the policy was [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=565.72s)]
*  necessary. It contributed [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=567.72s)]
*  to the economic growth. And [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=569.72s)]
*  that's why our country and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=571.72s)]
*  us could survive. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=573.72s)]
*  And I tried to argue [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=575.72s)]
*  with my mom, but then I realized I [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=577.72s)]
*  couldn't change her mind. And even [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=579.72s)]
*  after she'd seen the film, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=581.72s)]
*  she still believed us so. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=583.72s)]
*  And it was so [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=585.72s)]
*  hard for me to understand. And [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=587.72s)]
*  I thought a lot, and eventually [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=589.72s)]
*  I understood how [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=591.72s)]
*  effective the propaganda was. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=593.72s)]
*  It was decades of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=595.72s)]
*  messaging, education, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=597.72s)]
*  and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=599.72s)]
*  every single message around them [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=601.72s)]
*  was saying how great the policy [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=603.72s)]
*  was and how necessary [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=605.72s)]
*  it was. And it was really hard [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=607.72s)]
*  to change the way that they think [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=609.72s)]
*  because they were not encouraged [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=611.72s)]
*  to ask questions. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=613.72s)]
*  And throughout their life, they were [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=615.72s)]
*  taught to not question. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=617.72s)]
*  Okay, let's take a look at a [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=619.72s)]
*  clip here as well. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=621.72s)]
*  Becoming a mother felt [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=623.72s)]
*  like giving birth to my memories. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=625.72s)]
*  A rush [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=627.72s)]
*  of images from my early life [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=629.72s)]
*  came back to me. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=631.72s)]
*  I thought [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=633.72s)]
*  of my own parents and the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=635.72s)]
*  name they gave me. They chose [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=637.72s)]
*  the name Nanfu [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=639.72s)]
*  before I was born. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=641.72s)]
*  Nan means man [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=643.72s)]
*  and fu means pillar. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=645.72s)]
*  They hoped for a boy [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=647.72s)]
*  who would grow up to be the pillar of the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=649.72s)]
*  family. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=651.72s)]
*  When I was born a girl, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=653.72s)]
*  they named me Nanfu anyway, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=655.72s)]
*  hoping that I would grow up strong [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=657.72s)]
*  like a man. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=659.72s)]
*  You know, it's interesting that this [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=663.72s)]
*  brings into this [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=665.72s)]
*  intersection this sort of deep-rooted [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=667.72s)]
*  cultural sexism [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=669.72s)]
*  that it's impossible to separate from [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=671.72s)]
*  the one-child policy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=673.72s)]
*  It added, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=675.72s)]
*  as you point out, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=677.72s)]
*  to the volume of abandoned babies [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=679.72s)]
*  that were [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=681.72s)]
*  literally being discarded. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=683.72s)]
*  You share the story [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=685.72s)]
*  of your cousin [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=687.72s)]
*  and what happened to her, something that your uncle [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=689.72s)]
*  had never really talked about [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=691.72s)]
*  and yet he did [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=693.72s)]
*  on camera about this. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=695.72s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=697.72s)]
*  My uncle had a daughter [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=699.72s)]
*  and his mom [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=701.72s)]
*  wanted a grandson. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=703.72s)]
*  So my grandma [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=705.72s)]
*  sort of like threatened him, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=707.72s)]
*  it's either me or your daughter. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=709.72s)]
*  If you keep her [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=711.72s)]
*  I'm going to commit suicide. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=713.72s)]
*  And so my uncle was forced [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=715.72s)]
*  to give away the daughter. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=717.72s)]
*  But at the time, no one [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=719.72s)]
*  wanted a daughter so he couldn't give it away. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=721.72s)]
*  And what he did [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=723.72s)]
*  was leaving [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=725.72s)]
*  the girl, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=727.72s)]
*  the infant girl, I think she was only [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=729.72s)]
*  20 days old, and [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=731.72s)]
*  in the market where everybody [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=733.72s)]
*  was going to shop for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=735.72s)]
*  grocery, the village market. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=737.72s)]
*  And he was hoping that someone [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=739.72s)]
*  who goes to the market will see this girl [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=741.72s)]
*  and want it or like adopt [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=743.72s)]
*  her and take her home. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=745.72s)]
*  And what happened was [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=747.72s)]
*  it was summer and he left [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=749.72s)]
*  her there overnight. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=751.72s)]
*  No one showed up, no one wanted her [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=753.72s)]
*  another day and the girl was [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=755.72s)]
*  bitten by mosquitoes all over [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=757.72s)]
*  her body and [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=759.72s)]
*  she died. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=761.72s)]
*  How long did you work as a worker? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=763.72s)]
*  I was working [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=765.72s)]
*  as a worker. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=767.72s)]
*  I was working in the village. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=769.72s)]
*  I was not allowed to work. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=771.72s)]
*  I was in the house. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=773.72s)]
*  I was working as a worker. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=777.72s)]
*  I worked for three minutes [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=779.72s)]
*  and I was already dead. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=781.72s)]
*  My mother was going to die. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=783.72s)]
*  She was going to die. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=785.72s)]
*  If she had left me, I would have died. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=787.72s)]
*  If not, I would have been killed. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=789.72s)]
*  I would have died. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=791.72s)]
*  My father had a lot of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=793.72s)]
*  problems at home. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=795.72s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=797.72s)]
*  Again and again throughout the film [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=799.72s)]
*  you see people say [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=801.72s)]
*  they just had no choice. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=803.72s)]
*  How do you get to that point where [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=805.72s)]
*  consistently all these people [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=807.72s)]
*  are able to sit by [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=809.72s)]
*  or they're able to carry out [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=811.72s)]
*  policy? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=813.72s)]
*  You spoke to a government worker [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=815.72s)]
*  that's received lots of honors and so forth [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=817.72s)]
*  and she was almost proud of it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=819.72s)]
*  You see the village elder who [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=821.72s)]
*  has his own reservations. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=823.72s)]
*  There's lots of different people even down to your family. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=825.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=827.72s)]
*  When we started the film I thought it was [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=829.72s)]
*  going to be a simple story. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=831.72s)]
*  There are perpetrators, there are victims [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=833.72s)]
*  and then as soon as I met with the officials [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=835.72s)]
*  the midwives, the people who carried out [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=837.72s)]
*  the policy, I soon realized [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=839.72s)]
*  that these were not bad people. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=841.72s)]
*  They were not evil, they were not perpetrators. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=843.72s)]
*  They were [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=845.72s)]
*  actually great people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=847.72s)]
*  They wanted to do a good job. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=849.72s)]
*  They wanted to be contributing [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=851.72s)]
*  to the government. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=853.72s)]
*  I started thinking like what made these [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=855.72s)]
*  good people do evil things? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=857.72s)]
*  That was a narrative that I think [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=859.72s)]
*  throughout the world that we are familiar [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=861.72s)]
*  with. That people say I follow [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=863.72s)]
*  the order, I don't have a choice. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=865.72s)]
*  The policy is the policy. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=867.72s)]
*  Especially in China when [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=869.72s)]
*  people were [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=871.72s)]
*  educated to follow the order [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=873.72s)]
*  and especially to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=875.72s)]
*  sacrifice their individuality [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=877.72s)]
*  and follow the collective, believe [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=879.72s)]
*  the collective the greater good. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=881.72s)]
*  You also examine another [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=883.72s)]
*  thread which is the trafficking [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=885.72s)]
*  of these babies. In 1992 [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=887.72s)]
*  China made it possible for foreigners to adopt [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=889.72s)]
*  children and [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=891.72s)]
*  all of a sudden the world [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=893.72s)]
*  started to look at orphanages. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=895.72s)]
*  Wow, cute Chinese baby [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=897.72s)]
*  girls. There's so many of them. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=899.72s)]
*  Can we adopt them? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=901.72s)]
*  You find [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=903.72s)]
*  a couple of different characters. One a journalist [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=905.72s)]
*  in Hong Kong and a [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=907.72s)]
*  family in Utah who've been chronicling [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=909.72s)]
*  and cataloging [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=911.72s)]
*  kind of unintended consequences [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=913.72s)]
*  of what happens when you basically [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=915.72s)]
*  create a market incentive. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=917.72s)]
*  What I learned was [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=919.72s)]
*  at some times the government realized [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=921.72s)]
*  that they could actually make profit [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=923.72s)]
*  out of the international adoption [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=925.72s)]
*  program. Each adoptive [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=927.72s)]
*  family go to China and they [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=929.72s)]
*  adopted the child and they would [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=931.72s)]
*  pay a fee. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=933.72s)]
*  All the orphanages were owned [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=935.72s)]
*  by the state. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=937.72s)]
*  So they realized they could [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=939.72s)]
*  make money out of it. Then they would [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=941.72s)]
*  wait for pregnant women [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=943.72s)]
*  to carry the baby to full [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=945.72s)]
*  term, allow that to happen [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=947.72s)]
*  and then once the baby was born [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=949.72s)]
*  they would go then [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=951.72s)]
*  take the baby away [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=953.72s)]
*  saying that they violated the one child [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=955.72s)]
*  policy and then put the baby [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=957.72s)]
*  in the orphanage for [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=959.72s)]
*  adoption. Is there any way [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=961.72s)]
*  the local governments did not know about this? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=963.72s)]
*  This was done by the local [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=965.72s)]
*  government and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=967.72s)]
*  it was not even [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=969.72s)]
*  one province or two. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=971.72s)]
*  It happened in many different [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=973.72s)]
*  provinces across the country [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=975.72s)]
*  and the journalist [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=977.72s)]
*  we interviewed had done [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=979.72s)]
*  a lot of research and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=981.72s)]
*  he eventually was banned to live in China [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=983.72s)]
*  and he had to move to Hong Kong. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=985.72s)]
*  And the family that's in Utah [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=987.72s)]
*  that's trying to do DNA tests [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=989.72s)]
*  and trying to build a database [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=991.72s)]
*  it's limited success. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=993.72s)]
*  They've been trying but [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=995.72s)]
*  some of these are situations [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=997.72s)]
*  where twins have been separated at birth [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=999.72s)]
*  and they're adopted [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1001.72s)]
*  and living in the United States [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1003.72s)]
*  without any [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1005.72s)]
*  knowledge that they have [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1007.72s)]
*  a sibling, a sister more likely than not [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1009.72s)]
*  in China. Yeah. One of the examples [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1011.72s)]
*  was there were twin sisters [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1013.72s)]
*  and the government [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1015.72s)]
*  went and say they violated the one child [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1017.72s)]
*  policy so one twin [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1019.72s)]
*  was taken away and put in [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1021.72s)]
*  the orphanage and soon the twin [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1023.72s)]
*  was adopted by an [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1025.72s)]
*  American family. So [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1027.72s)]
*  they were separated like [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1029.72s)]
*  when they were infants. And the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1031.72s)]
*  parents who adopted in the United States it was [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1033.72s)]
*  also what tough for them to understand [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1035.72s)]
*  that what they thought was an orphanage [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1037.72s)]
*  and but actually [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1039.72s)]
*  could have been a nefarious situation? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1041.72s)]
*  Absolutely. It was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1043.72s)]
*  really hard for some families to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1045.72s)]
*  accept the truth that their [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1047.72s)]
*  daughters, their children [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1049.72s)]
*  were not orphans. They have [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1051.72s)]
*  families, they have parents and the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1053.72s)]
*  government fabricated all [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1055.72s)]
*  the information. Ironically [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1057.72s)]
*  China gets credited with pulling [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1059.72s)]
*  up out of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1061.72s)]
*  abject poverty to [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1063.72s)]
*  300 million people in a very short period [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1065.72s)]
*  of time which is something no country's ever [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1067.72s)]
*  accomplished. Yeah there is [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1069.72s)]
*  a lot of debate among [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1071.72s)]
*  economists, sociologists, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1073.72s)]
*  anthropologists [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1075.72s)]
*  on whether and how much [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1077.72s)]
*  the one child policy really had [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1079.72s)]
*  effect on the country's economy [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1081.72s)]
*  and I think both sides [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1083.72s)]
*  of the debate there is no way to [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1085.72s)]
*  prove like this is the only factor [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1087.72s)]
*  that made it work or this does [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1089.72s)]
*  not have any contribution [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1091.72s)]
*  towards it. But I think [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1093.72s)]
*  one thing is clear is this policy [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1095.72s)]
*  had very severe [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1097.72s)]
*  human consequences. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O16gNNMZdU&t=1099.72s)]
