*  Sure. It's something that has [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=51.18s)]
*  occurred to me for a long time, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=53.1s)]
*  which is that we see [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=55.34s)]
*  authoritarian governments [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=56.64s)]

*  emphasis on controlling [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=61.480000000000004s)]

*  in a big publishing conference [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=73.48s)]

*  retell the story of his [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=84.48s)]
*  rule, digging up graves [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=86.78s)]
*  to try to contradict [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=88.98s)]
*  the prevailing narrative, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  jailing historians who [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=92.22s)]
*  expose the truth, shutting down [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=94.28s)]
*  organizations that are focused [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=96.68s)]
*  on historical memory. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=98.54s)]
*  And so witnessing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  the degree to which [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=102.84s)]
*  authoritarians have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  zeroed in on culture [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  as a centerpiece of how [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  they're advancing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  their own agenda, how they're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=112.48s)]
*  sustaining control, how [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=113.94s)]
*  they're projecting a global [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=115.6s)]
*  image. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=117.38s)]
*  I wanted to focus on the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=118.48s)]
*  role of democracies and what [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=120.3s)]
*  democracies could do to engage [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=121.84s)]
*  culture. I feel like culture [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=123.7s)]
*  is a tool that has, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  to some degree, been left [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=126.9s)]
*  on the sideline. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=128.4s)]
*  You've mentioned history as [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=129.78s)]
*  being one of the battlefields [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=131.44s)]
*  of culture, whether it be in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  China trying to do the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=134.54s)]
*  history. And of course, you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=135.68s)]
*  just said in the United [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=137.0s)]
*  States, this notion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=138.14s)]
*  that we're fighting over how [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=140.34s)]
*  to do our history. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=141.78s)]
*  But why is it right now [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=142.66s)]
*  that recapturing history has [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=144.84s)]
*  become such a flash point, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=146.46s)]
*  whether it be China or the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=147.9s)]
*  United States? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=148.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think here in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=150.14s)]
*  the United States, we're [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  at this, you know, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  inflection point in some ways [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=154.9s)]
*  as a pluralistic society [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=156.4s)]
*  where we're on the cusp of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=157.9s)]
*  having no one single [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  racial majority in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=161.4s)]
*  our population. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=163.24s)]
*  And that is a significant [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  change. And we're wrestling [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=165.94s)]
*  with what that means. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  We see this in our work [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  on college campuses [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=170.4s)]
*  and the sort of tension [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=172.04s)]
*  between the effort to make [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=174.34s)]
*  the campus a more diverse, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=176.28s)]
*  equal and inclusive place, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=178.1s)]
*  if you will, and the robust [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=179.68s)]
*  protection of free speech and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=181.64s)]
*  academic freedom. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=183.04s)]
*  I think the changes in our [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=184.14s)]
*  population and the move [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=185.54s)]
*  toward a more pluralistic [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=186.84s)]
*  society are testing some of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=187.98s)]
*  these core principles, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  including how we think about [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=190.84s)]
*  our history and how we [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=192.6s)]
*  integrate different [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=193.88s)]
*  perspectives. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=194.73999999999998s)]
*  I also think there's some [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=195.6s)]
*  hopeful [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=196.98s)]
*  signs in how [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  institutions, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=201.1s)]
*  place like Monticello has [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=202.4s)]
*  come, Jefferson's home, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=203.9s)]
*  you know, how they've come to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=205.94s)]
*  integrate the history of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=207.04s)]
*  his role as a slave holder [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=208.66s)]
*  and the slaves on the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=210.34s)]
*  plantation there, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=211.74s)]
*  you know, alongside his [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=213.2s)]
*  accomplishments as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=214.6s)]
*  statesman and visionary. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  They don't erase anything. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=218.5s)]
*  They add to the story. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=219.94s)]
*  And I think sort of as a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=221.24s)]
*  society, we're [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=222.44s)]
*  wrestling with, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=224.24s)]
*  what that looks for like for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=225.76s)]
*  us kind of writ large [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=227.54s)]
*  and in our curriculum. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=229.14s)]
*  And I think in a place [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=231.1s)]
*  like China, you know, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=233.54s)]
*  because we're living in a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=235.0s)]
*  smaller world, there's a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=236.0s)]
*  recognition that and people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=237.2s)]
*  are better informed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=239.2s)]
*  I mean, suddenly you have a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=240.2s)]
*  highly literate population. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=241.7s)]
*  And so, you know, these [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=243.44s)]
*  battles of ideas, I think [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  matter not just among elites [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=247.2s)]
*  as they always did, you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=249.54s)]
*  know, but in a much more [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=251.44s)]
*  popular sense. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=253.04s)]
*  And it's become a central [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=254.84s)]
*  kind of frontier of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=257.36s)]
*  contestation, both internally [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=258.4s)]
*  within China to hold [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=260.74s)]
*  together a narrative that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=261.88s)]
*  keeps people, you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=263.6s)]
*  more or less fiescent and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=264.98s)]
*  accepting of the way that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=266.38s)]
*  things are and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=267.5s)]
*  internationally to burnish [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=268.7s)]

*  they're trying to project. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=271.7s)]
*  But you go around the world, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=272.98s)]
*  everybody's watching American [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=274.5s)]

*  Isn't it better to let it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  happen naturally through, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=282.6s)]
*  you know, the way we do our [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=284.94s)]
*  culture and entertainment [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=286.7s)]
*  around the world? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=287.8s)]
*  I think that's right when it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=288.94s)]
*  comes to the promotion of [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=290.04s)]
*  American culture, which [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=291.44s)]
*  really is not the centerpiece [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=292.68s)]
*  of my argument. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  My argument is about local [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=294.94s)]
*  cultures and the role of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=297.44s)]
*  local cultural figures, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  culture makers, cultural [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  icons and the power and the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=303.04s)]
*  potency they can have as [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  counterweights to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=307.38s)]
*  authoritarians. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=308.38s)]
*  I've seen it very vividly [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=309.1s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=311.24s)]
*  We've done a lot of work with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  Penn Ukraine over the last [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=313.24s)]
*  sort of seven or eight years [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=315.24s)]
*  building up that organization [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  of writers in Ukraine as a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  place with a very strong [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=319.7s)]
*  literary and scholarly [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  tradition and witnessing the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=323.24s)]
*  pride that they are taking in [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=326.14s)]
*  their own culture. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=327.9s)]
*  Now, I went to Ukraine in [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=328.7s)]
*  December of twenty twenty two. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=331.0s)]
*  So really a dark moment, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  you know, six or seven months [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=336.46s)]
*  into the war. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=338.2s)]
*  And when we got there, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=339.4s)]
*  we were stunned to see in a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=341.4s)]
*  cultural hall in the center of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  Kiev, they were mounting a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  brand new exhibition devoted [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=346.34s)]
*  to a venerated philosopher. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=348.96s)]
*  And it was beautiful. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=351.02s)]
*  And it had all kinds of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=352.32s)]
*  explications of his work and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  interactive elements. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  And they had brought there a [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  statue from a museum [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  dedicated to his life. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=361.26s)]
*  And the statue had been [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=362.7s)]
*  damaged in the war. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  They had attacked the statue [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=365.2s)]
*  was kind of pockmarked, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  but still standing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=367.82s)]
*  So kind of an icon to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  resilience of the Ukrainian [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=371.12s)]
*  people, just the pride that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=372.46s)]
*  they had in that exhibition [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=374.46s)]
*  at that moment really spoke to me. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=377.08s)]
*  I saw to myself that this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=379.47999999999996s)]
*  they are driving strength [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=381.52s)]
*  and spirit and nurture [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=384.41999999999996s)]
*  from their own culture [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  and help them get through [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=388.08s)]
*  this moment. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=389.26s)]
*  And it was just so powerful. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=390.02s)]
*  They continued with that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  over the ensuing now, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, 14 months, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=394.96s)]
*  they travel all around [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=396.18s)]
*  the country doing events, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=397.26s)]
*  bringing books to the front lines. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=398.58s)]
*  They teach the Ukrainian [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=403.26s)]
*  language to Russian speakers [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=404.88s)]
*  who now want the Ukrainian [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=406.96s)]
*  to be their lingua franca. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=409.26s)]
*  And so it's it's extraordinary [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=410.9s)]
*  to see sort of what role [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=412.82s)]
*  culture is playing in their effort [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  to fight off, fight this war [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  and win this war and sustain [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=419.56s)]
*  the morale of the Ukrainian people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, that for me [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=424.06s)]
*  was an important spark for this piece. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=425.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I can go back in history, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=427.46s)]
*  especially in the Soviet Union, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=429.06s)]
*  when it was such [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=431.2s)]
*  whether it be Solzhenitsyn [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=432.7s)]
*  or Ribakov and others [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=434.2s)]
*  who are great writers there [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=435.52s)]
*  that expressed an idea of freedom [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=438.97999999999996s)]
*  and democracy and help [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  push the narrative forward. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=442.26s)]
*  Do you think, though, that we [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  either as NGOs like Penn [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=446.78s)]
*  or the U.S. government [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=448.91999999999996s)]
*  should be supporting writers like that? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  I think organizations like Penn, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=452.38s)]
*  absolutely. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=453.96s)]
*  You know, that's the work that we do [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=455.46s)]
*  standing with dissident writers, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=457.32s)]
*  people who take a risk [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=460.06s)]
*  to express themselves, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=461.46s)]
*  who are targeted for [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=463.06s)]
*  what they publish, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=465.18s)]
*  standing with them, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=466.58s)]
*  advocating on their behalf [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=468.18s)]
*  when they're persecuted, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  when they're jailed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=470.44s)]
*  And that, you know, it's important [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  not just for them, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=472.48s)]
*  but for all other writers [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=473.62s)]
*  who might be sitting [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=475.68s)]
*  in front of their computer [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=476.94s)]
*  thinking about, you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=478.44s)]
*  whether it's worth taking the risk. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=479.58s)]
*  Should they say what they really think? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=481.68s)]
*  What's going to happen to them? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=483.82s)]
*  Who is going to defend them [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=485.48s)]
*  if that knock comes on the door [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=486.88s)]
*  and they get hauled away? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=488.94s)]
*  And so we try to send the message. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=490.34000000000003s)]
*  Look, there is this [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=492.58s)]
*  international community of writers. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=493.44s)]
*  There is an organization like Penn [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=495.4s)]
*  that will have your back. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=497.4s)]
*  And I think that's extremely important [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=498.6s)]
*  because those voices, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=500.28s)]
*  I mean, you remember them [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=501.44s)]
*  because they were so salient [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=502.44s)]
*  to the way that that struggle [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=505.18s)]
*  was waged and won. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=506.58s)]
*  They had authenticity. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=507.88s)]
*  They told stories that laid bare, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=509.44s)]
*  you know, what a news report [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=512.24s)]
*  could never do, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=513.54s)]
*  what a foreign politician [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=514.54s)]
*  could never get across. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=516.34s)]
*  You know, there is a profound resonance [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=518.54s)]
*  and a kind of depth of connection [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=521.8s)]
*  that people feel to, you know, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=523.54s)]
*  their own writers, their own filmmakers, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=525.76s)]
*  their own artists, their own musicians [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=528.16s)]
*  that are in a tradition [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=530.5s)]
*  that they engage with their entire lives. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=532.4599999999999s)]
*  And so the power of that, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  I think, is quite unique. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=537.24s)]
*  And, you know, it's not something [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=539.0s)]
*  I don't think it's about [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=540.54s)]
*  the West harnessing it per se, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=541.56s)]
*  but it's about finding appropriate ways [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=543.5s)]
*  to support and defend those individuals [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=546.16s)]
*  so that they can authentically [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=548.9s)]
*  have their voice and their influence [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=551.56s)]
*  in a manner of their own design. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not something, you know, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=555.56s)]
*  by its nature, it can't be controlled [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=556.66s)]
*  from the outside. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=558.5s)]
*  Let me read a sentence from your piece [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=559.6199999999999s)]
*  and have you unpack it for me. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=561.6199999999999s)]
*  It's democracies and autocracies [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=563.9599999999999s)]
*  are waging a global battle, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=566.16s)]
*  principally through military, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=568.16s)]
*  political, economic and diplomatic means. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=569.6199999999999s)]
*  Yet the outcome of the contest [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=573.06s)]
*  will hinge significantly on culture. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=575.4599999999999s)]
*  Is that because there's just an innate clash of cultures [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=579.22s)]
*  between totalitarian regimes and democracies? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=583.66s)]
*  I think that's part of it, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=587.72s)]
*  but I also think that cultural control [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=588.92s)]
*  and who shapes the cultural narrative [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=593.08s)]
*  ends up being, you know, sometimes dispositive [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=595.66s)]
*  in how these contests unfold. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=599.48s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that the narrative [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=601.98s)]
*  of the Soviet Union, you know, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=603.62s)]
*  eventually it was punctured. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=605.86s)]
*  It was pockmarked. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=607.86s)]
*  It was called into question, you know, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=609.36s)]
*  by those legendary writers, by Sami Stott, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=611.32s)]
*  you know, partially by Western efforts [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=614.62s)]
*  to cast it in a particular light through films and books. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=619.42s)]
*  And, you know, all of that over time [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=624.32s)]
*  made it impossible to sustain the story [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=626.46s)]
*  of this powerful nation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=630.02s)]
*  Of course, it coincided with economic decline [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=631.36s)]
*  that, you know, overtook them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=635.22s)]
*  But I think the cultural piece, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=637.52s)]
*  the fact that authoritarians pay so much attention [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=639.68s)]
*  to shaping this, and, you know, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=642.5799999999999s)]
*  now it's a very different arena. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=644.18s)]
*  So much of our cultural engagement [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=646.38s)]
*  happens in the digital realm. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=648.62s)]
*  There are all kinds of efforts through social media, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=651.12s)]
*  through propaganda and disinformation, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=655.22s)]
*  now enabled by AI, where governments can tell [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=657.78s)]
*  whatever story they choose. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're investing very significantly. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=663.92s)]
*  You know, the Chinese government in trying to shape [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=666.42s)]
*  the political attitudes of their diaspora communities [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=669.5799999999999s)]
*  around the world through online channels, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=673.92s)]
*  through news outlets that are controlled in Beijing, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=676.52s)]
*  that are read by Chinese communities [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=680.0799999999999s)]
*  here in the United States, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  by trying to rein in what Chinese people [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=684.92s)]
*  here in the United States publish or say, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=688.02s)]
*  or what dance performances get done. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=691.56s)]
*  And so, you know, to me, the amount of effort [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=693.68s)]
*  and attention that the authoritarians are paying to this [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=697.4799999999999s)]
*  is ought to be a signal to us of how it matters [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=701.2399999999999s)]
*  and how central they see it [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=705.18s)]
*  to the continuity of their regimes. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=707.88s)]
*  Well, let's take China as an example, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=711.18s)]
*  because it's a country where we felt, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=713.52s)]
*  with cultural influence, it would move them a bit [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=716.3399999999999s)]
*  to more openness, more freedom and democracy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=720.3399999999999s)]
*  We felt that way about trading with China, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=722.88s)]
*  but we also had, as you said, a cultural impact on China. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=725.12s)]
*  It was Hollywood movies that went over there. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=730.34s)]
*  It was the NBA basketball over there. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=732.54s)]
*  All of our cultural product, you know, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=735.68s)]
*  had a great outlet in China. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=740.78s)]
*  And yet, now, everything's moving in the other direction. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=742.92s)]
*  Xi Jinping, it's much more controlled. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=745.92s)]
*  It didn't happen. Why? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=748.44s)]
*  Well, I think there was a sort of naive notion [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=750.98s)]
*  that with enough engagement, enough ties, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=753.38s)]
*  that kind of the natural appeal of the Western order, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=757.38s)]
*  of openness, of democracy, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=762.28s)]
*  would kind of automatically take hold. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=764.94s)]
*  And obviously, we've learned that's not true. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=768.58s)]
*  The appeal of capitalism, in many respects, did take hold, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=770.9200000000001s)]
*  but the Chinese government was very strict [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=774.84s)]
*  and, let's face it, quite effective [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=777.74s)]
*  in preventing what many in the West anticipated [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=779.74s)]
*  would be this kind of inexorable, unavoidable [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=783.64s)]
*  political opening that would accompany [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=787.28s)]
*  a transition toward greater capitalism. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=789.64s)]
*  And, you know, when you look at the Chinese government's [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=792.74s)]
*  approach to this, it's really shifted. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=795.48s)]
*  We did a report at PEN America some years, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=797.1s)]
*  about five years ago, called Made in Hollywood, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=800.44s)]
*  Censored in Beijing, about how Hollywood filmmaking [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=803.74s)]
*  was being shaped by government censors [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=807.68s)]
*  out of the Chinese government, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=811.4799999999999s)]
*  because China had become, at the time, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=812.9399999999999s)]
*  it was the second largest global film market. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=814.8199999999999s)]
*  It's now the largest. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=817.9399999999999s)]
*  And in order to get onto a short list of Western films [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=819.68s)]
*  that were approved for release into China, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=824.2199999999999s)]
*  you had to please the censor. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  So if you had a Chinese villain, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  or you had an American military victory over China, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  that was not gonna pass muster. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=835.18s)]
*  If you had even a Taiwanese flag, as they did in Top Gun, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=836.84s)]
*  that was considered unacceptable. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=841.38s)]
*  And Hollywood filmmakers played ball, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=843.3000000000001s)]
*  because it was a financial incentive for them to do so. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=846.2s)]
*  And I think some of them were uncomfortable with it, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=849.64s)]
*  but they made the argument to themselves, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=852.0s)]
*  look, we're getting into this important market, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=854.6800000000001s)]
*  we're having some influence, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=856.7800000000001s)]
*  maybe that will lead to openness. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=858.1800000000001s)]
*  I think what happened over the last few years [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=860.24s)]
*  is the Beijing authorities really [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=862.44s)]
*  sort of turned around on this, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=865.14s)]
*  and decided they were better off really doubling down [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=866.9399999999999s)]
*  on their own domestic film industry. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=870.54s)]
*  And they have not expanded the number of foreign films [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=872.9s)]
*  that come in. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=875.84s)]
*  Increasingly, they're investing in local blockbusters [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=876.88s)]
*  that they have influence over, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=880.24s)]
*  that reinforce their narratives. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=882.34s)]
*  You're not gonna see anything like [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=884.18s)]
*  the kind of independent filmmaking that we have here, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=886.34s)]
*  where there are challenges to authority, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=890.58s)]
*  and alternative storylines that come to the fore. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=892.84s)]
*  That's not gonna happen in China. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=896.6s)]
*  Well, let's take a place that you mentioned [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=898.2s)]
*  where it actually has worked some, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=900.08s)]
*  which is Poland, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=902.5s)]
*  and the struggle for democracy versus authoritarianism there. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=903.84s)]
*  Culture played a big role, explain that. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=907.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I focus on a particular film [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=910.2s)]
*  that was released shortly before the election this fall, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=914.08s)]
*  which had a kind of surprising and positive result [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=919.34s)]
*  with the elevation of Donald Tusk, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=922.82s)]
*  and a new government that is much more [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=925.88s)]
*  kind of classically liberal and open. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=928.38s)]
*  And the film looked at how Poland was handling the crisis [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=931.22s)]
*  at its border with Belarus, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  and the very harsh approaches of the Duda government, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=938.34s)]
*  and just the mistreatment of migrants. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=942.58s)]
*  And it was a very kind of bold-faced, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=944.84s)]
*  unvarnished look by Agnieszka Holland, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=949.14s)]
*  who's a well-regarded filmmaker. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=951.9s)]
*  And the government got very upset by this film. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=955.14s)]
*  They wanted to suppress it, they delayed it. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=957.9s)]
*  They tagged kind of a warning screen on it, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=960.34s)]
*  saying that they disagreed with it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=962.84s)]
*  But within a matter of weeks, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=964.38s)]
*  it became the second most watched film of the year, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=966.3000000000001s)]
*  even though it was released at the end of the year. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=969.4000000000001s)]
*  And having that voice out there, that independent voice, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=972.3599999999999s)]
*  a Pole telling a Polish story, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=976.8s)]
*  holding up a mirror against the government to show Poles [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=980.8399999999999s)]
*  what was really going on, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=986.14s)]
*  and help shape how they thought as they went to the Poles, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=988.4599999999999s)]
*  that just has extraordinary power. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=992.4399999999999s)]
*  It's different than any exhortation from behind a podium. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=994.5999999999999s)]
*  It's something that speaks to people viscerally [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=999.7s)]
*  and emotionally. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1002.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, culture shapes politics, even here at home, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  we're seeing it, everything in the history wars, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  to a popular culture. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1009.5s)]
*  I think a lot of conservatives would say [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1011.44s)]
*  that the entertainment industry, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1013.84s)]
*  the popular culture industry, skews very much of the left [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1015.74s)]
*  and leaves them out. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1019.64s)]
*  Do you think that's a problem here? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1021.24s)]
*  Look, I think it's crucial that we hear all voices [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1023.7s)]
*  in our culture at PEN America. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1027.34s)]
*  We fight against efforts to cancel books. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1030.2s)]
*  People wanna cancel the memoirs [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1032.94s)]
*  from members of the Trump administration, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1035.44s)]
*  or the book contract signed by Amy Coney Barrett. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1037.5400000000002s)]
*  I think those voices need to be out there. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1041.14s)]
*  I think people of all kinds need to see themselves [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1044.44s)]
*  somewhere in the larger culture. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1047.9s)]
*  And I think that exists, whether it's in country music, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1050.14s)]
*  in the panoply of just about everything that you can find [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1055.2800000000002s)]
*  on television these days. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1059.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, that said, there is a left-leaning skew [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1061.28s)]
*  in Hollywood, and that probably is not wrong, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  but you can't control that centrally. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1070.48s)]
*  I think people can invest, and we can make sure [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1073.26s)]
*  as an organization like PEN, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1077.46s)]
*  where we try to bring together different voices, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1078.68s)]
*  we're cognizant that we want people [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1080.92s)]
*  from across the ideological spectrum [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1082.8600000000001s)]
*  to feel like they can be part of that conversation. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1085.76s)]
*  Suzanne Nossel, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1088.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1092.36s)]
*  ["Penny Barrett"] [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ0VgAwspDE&t=1093.46s)]
