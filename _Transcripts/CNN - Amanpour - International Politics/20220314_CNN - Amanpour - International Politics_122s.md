Video Description: Russia claims it is opening humanitarian corridors from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol to enable civilians to evacuate. But it is too late for many. Today, it emerged that a pregnant woman who was photographed last week being carried from one of the city’s bombed maternity hospitals has died, along with her baby. To discuss the dire humanitarian situation, Christiane speaks with the U.N.’s emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths.

# Martin Griffiths: The Double Standards Towards Refugees | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI)
*  I want to ask you because the UN says 2.8 million have already fled. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=0.0s)]
*  And you're well aware, despite the unbelievable generosity of so many countries these days [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=4.32s)]
*  for these Ukrainian refugees, there is also a backlash in other parts of the world, which [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  point out that actually during the crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, there [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=16.52s)]
*  was not the same kind of hospitality. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=22.56s)]
*  There's a real racism, there's a real double standard, there's real hypocrisy in the world [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=25.12s)]
*  about this issue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=31.0s)]
*  What can you say about that? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=33.32s)]
*  I mean, you were fundamentally involved in Syria and Yemen on these issues as well. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=34.32s)]
*  Yes, it's a huge worry. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=39.84s)]
*  In fact, I'm going to be launching this year's Yemen appeal in two days from now in Geneva, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=41.92s)]
*  asking for the same kind of generosity to the people of Yemen that we see to the people [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=49.32s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=52.96s)]
*  And there is a shocking different set of priorities for people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=54.48s)]
*  It's right and proper that people in those neighboring countries should welcome people in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=60.96s)]
*  We know that, by the way, Syrians have been welcomed into Turkey with great generosity, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  into Pakistan from Afghanistan with great generosity. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  So we've seen that elsewhere. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=74.16s)]
*  But what I worry about is the way in which the secondary impacts, the rise in prices [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  consequent upon the war in Ukraine, will also make it more difficult in these other countries. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=83.12s)]
*  I'm told that Lebanon, for now, for example, which depends for half of its wheat imports [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=88.64s)]
*  on Ukraine, now has less than a month's supply left in country. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=94.08s)]
*  And Lebanon was always a fragile country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=99.12s)]
*  So we need to keep our eye on the world as well as on Ukraine. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMAf_3CrI&t=106.56s)]
