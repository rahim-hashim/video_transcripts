# Chris Murphy Analyzes Tensions between the US and Iran  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y)
*  What do you think is the risk to Americans today? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  It has been long-standing policy of the United States [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=4.2s)]
*  to take actions to try to deter Iranian aggression in the region. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=7.4s)]
*  That aggression has led to the death of hundreds of U.S. soldiers [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=12.1s)]
*  during the conflict in Iraq, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=15.6s)]
*  and they continue to support terrorist elements throughout the region. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=17.0s)]
*  And so we need to remember, even at this moment, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  where there's going to be a lot of criticism of the president's actions, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=24.8s)]
*  that we continue to need to have a strategy that understands [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=28.2s)]
*  that Iran is an adversary to the United States, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=32.6s)]
*  and they support dangerous elements throughout the region [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=34.8s)]
*  that pose threats to civilians and to American forces and allies. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=38.2s)]
*  The question that we're asking today is whether or not [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=42.6s)]
*  the execution of Qassem Soleimani makes the United States safer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=45.7s)]
*  My contention is that it likely does not. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=51.2s)]
*  In fact, it will lead to a series of reprisals, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=53.3s)]
*  more military escalation between the United States and Iran, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=56.5s)]
*  that will ultimately get more Americans killed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  And given that the president inherited a relationship with Iran, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=63.099999999999994s)]
*  in which they had given up their nuclear program, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=67.5s)]
*  they were not launching attacks against U.S. personnel, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=70.5s)]
*  this is entirely a conflict of choice by this president. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=73.7s)]
*  Iran's behavior cannot be excused, but it didn't need to go this way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=78.7s)]
*  So the question then is, I guess, the ball, as I said to Mr. Morandi, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=82.6s)]
*  is in Iran's court right now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=86.5s)]
*  We don't know what Iran is going to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=87.8s)]
*  But in your situation, as members of Congress [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=90.5s)]
*  who believe in the War Powers Act and being notified, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=93.7s)]
*  what is your statement today, what is your realistic hope [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=97.9s)]
*  of being able to enact Congress's prerogative in this particular field, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=101.6s)]
*  which is in the conducting war? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=106.1s)]
*  Well, first, let's make it clear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=110.7s)]
*  We're now talking on Monday afternoon, American time, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=112.7s)]
*  and Congress has still not been briefed on this alleged imminent attack [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=115.7s)]
*  that was about to be lodged against American forces [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  that made it necessary to kill General Soleimani. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  We apparently are not going to get that briefing until Wednesday. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=129.8s)]
*  And I think it may speak to the relatively thin evidence that exists, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=133.6s)]
*  that there actually was a set of exigent emergency circumstances [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=137.6s)]
*  that required this attack. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration now absolutely has the obligation to come to Congress. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  If it wants to engage in continued military action against Iran, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=148.9s)]
*  for which there is no current authorization, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=152.4s)]
*  they need authorization from Congress. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=154.6s)]
*  And I hope that they will do that on their own. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=157.6s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=160.2s)]
*  But the process beginning in the House of Representatives this week [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=161.1s)]
*  to bring a war powers resolution before the House is necessary. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1Ys2-OW0Y&t=164.2s)]
