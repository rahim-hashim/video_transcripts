# Fmr. Member of Russian Parliament Fights for Ukraine | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY)
*  Ilya, what about... I mean, it is odd that a Russian, not just a Russian, a Russian parliamentary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=0.0s)]
*  member would come over here in the... I mean, I know you've been living here for a while. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  How did you get the Ukrainian military to accept you in their ranks? And are there any [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  other Russians that you know of anywhere around where you are fighting as well? For this side? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=17.46s)]
*  Ukraine? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=23.76s)]
*  Not where I am, but in general there are numerous Russians in Ukraine fighting. There were numerous [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=24.76s)]
*  Russians who were coming to join Ukrainian military volunteer groups back in 2014. I [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=33.28s)]
*  believe there are several thousand of them. There is one regiment which I know next to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=41.52s)]
*  fighting on the Ukrainian side against the invaders. But the question is very simple. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=48.76s)]
*  We think that the key to freedom in Russia right now is in Ukraine. If we are victorious [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=57.04s)]
*  here, if we will defeat Putin here, we will win Russia. That's very much like German anti-fascists [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  back in World War II. You know that the Chancellor Willy Brandt, for example, the leader of German [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=73.64s)]
*  Social Democrats, he was fighting within the Allied armies in Norway against German fascists. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=79.16s)]
*  And that's not because he was anti-German. And I am not anti-Russian. I am pro-Russian. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=87.76s)]
*  But I am anti-Putin. And we will kill the bastard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=92.88s)]
*  Well, you have written recently that you don't think he will be quote unquote on this planet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  in another year. But it is fascinating what you say because you are fighting for your [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  own country, to liberate your own country via Ukraine. That's obviously the one thing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=110.12s)]
*  that Putin really fears. One of the reasons many Russians and other analysts say that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=115.68s)]
*  he just doesn't want Ukraine to be free and democratic and independent is because then [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  ordinary Russians will start asking why it's not OK for them also to be free and democratic. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=127.04s)]
*  Do you get that sense? Is that where we are in your country, in Russia? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  I think so. Ukraine is very much the heel of the tendon for Mr. Putin. And his propaganda [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  all the way down, he was portraying Ukraine as a failed state because he was saying, ah, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  you see, Ukrainians have made their revolution and they are failing. And you shouldn't do [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=151.88s)]
*  the revolution here in Russia because you will fail as Ukrainians did. But we are not failing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRod4cqHuYY&t=157.35999999999999s)]
