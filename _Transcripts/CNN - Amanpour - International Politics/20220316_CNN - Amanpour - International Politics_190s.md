Video Description: Ukraine’s President Zelensky is appealing to the U.S. for a different act of bravery. In an urgent address before Congress, he made a plea for help, directed to an American audience. President Biden is sending Ukraine an additional $800 million in security assistance, but has not budged on the request for a no-fly zone. Seth Moulton joined the Marines just months before 9/11, served four tours in Iraq, and now serves in Congress. He was at the Capitol for Zelensky’s speech, and joins the show from Capitol Hill.

# Rep. Moulton on Ukraine War: "We Need to Move More Quickly" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw)
*  So, Congressman, it's very clear that he obviously still wants to know, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=0.0s)]
*  Flyzone, you're not going to give it, nor is NATO. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=4.0s)]
*  But it's the last paragraph that's the issue, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=6.48s)]
*  He wants much more sophisticated anti-aircraft, including the S-300s. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  And I understand that debate is underway in Congress. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=15.08s)]
*  Would you support that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=17.92s)]
*  Yes, this is an alternative that I fully support. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=20.2s)]
*  And in many ways, the United States has been supporting this all along. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=23.56s)]
*  We've been giving them Stinger anti-aircraft missiles since the very beginning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=26.52s)]
*  There are different, more advanced anti-aircraft systems that we can give them in addition. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=30.72s)]
*  In essence, there are different ways to enforce a no-fly zone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=35.64s)]
*  Zelensky has always asked for American pilots to be flying over Ukraine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=39.4s)]
*  I do not support that because it will put Americans in direct conflict with Russians. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=43.6s)]
*  And that does absolutely raise the risk of escalating the war, of this perhaps turning into World War Three. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=48.68s)]
*  In some ways, that's exactly what Putin wants. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=54.92s)]
*  Escalating the war will play into his hands. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=57.68s)]
*  His war in Ukraine is going badly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=60.68s)]
*  He wants to turn this into a Russia versus NATO war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  We should not let that happen. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=65.92s)]
*  But there's a lot more that we can do to get Russian planes out of the sky. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=67.6s)]
*  There's one other thing, Christiane, a lot of the danger, a lot of the damage that we're seeing in Ukrainian cities right now [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=71.48s)]
*  is not due to bombs dropped from aircraft, although that's a problem. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  It's due to artillery. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=80.6s)]
*  And there are counter-artillery, they're called counter-battery systems that we can provide the Ukrainians [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  to take out this Russian artillery when it fires on Ukrainian cities. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  Those are additional weapons that we should provide to the Ukrainians today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=91.68s)]
*  Indeed. And I mean, look, you're a former Marine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=95.92s)]
*  You get it. You understand the battle zone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  We do understand that a lot of that damage to the civilian infrastructure has been long-range artillery. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  But in the recent days, aircraft have played an increasingly and devastating role. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  So you say we can do this and that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Why aren't you doing it then? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=112.92s)]
*  Why isn't more of those anti-missile batteries getting there? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  And specifically what you just said, why aren't more of the more sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles not being deployed? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=118.36s)]
*  Those are great questions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think the answer is that all along here, we've been doing the right things, but we've been doing them too slowly. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=127.56s)]
*  I think there's interest in Congress and there's probably interest in the administration in providing these systems. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  But from the very beginning, we've just moved too slowly to provide the support to Ukraine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=138.44s)]
*  When I was last in Kiev in December, I came back and I wrote a private memo to the administration, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=143.12s)]
*  then published an op-ed in the journal saying exactly this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=148.12s)]
*  We need to move more quickly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=151.2s)]
*  You win wars by moving more quickly than your opponent, by out-foxing your opponent, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=153.12s)]
*  by making decisions more quickly than the opponent can respond. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=158.28s)]
*  We can't be playing defense here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=162.8s)]
*  We can't be always responding to what Putin does. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=164.44s)]
*  We need to take the initiative. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think weapons delivery is one example of a way in which we can move more quickly to support the Ukrainian cause. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elG7MMv0QXw&t=168.68s)]
