# Oxfam Humanitarian Worker on the Situation Inside Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk)
*  We're going to go live to Gaza to speak to the Oxfam humanitarian worker Omar Grib. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=0.0s)]
*  He is joining us by phone and we want to welcome you to the program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Can you first Omar start by telling us what you are witnessing right now? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=10.8s)]
*  What has been happening all day today? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=16.96s)]
*  Yes, thank you for having me, Christian. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  A lot is happening. You are witnessing a compounded round of escalation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=25.12s)]
*  So 600 Palestinians have been killed across the Gaza Strip and over 3,000 are wounded. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=34.56s)]
*  And of course the numbers are escalating by the minute. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  So Israel also declared a full closure of Gaza, which means no entry of food or fuel or medicine [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=47.44s)]
*  really compromising the humanitarian situation even more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=54.8s)]
*  What we witnessed is very heavy air strikes, hundreds of military air strikes by Israel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=58.64s)]
*  across the Gaza Strip by land, air and sea, including some of that destroyed essential [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=65.12s)]
*  water and sanitation infrastructure. It really raises the fear that Gaza will run out of drinkable [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  water. And keep in mind that drinkable water is already scarce. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=79.68s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of targeting to residential buildings, houses, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  towers, and you know, this is also affecting the displacement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, it's been a tough couple of days, honestly. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  Omar, on Saturday after this assault, Netanyahu told residents of Gaza to get out now [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  because we will operate everywhere and with full force. And you may have heard some very, very, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=106.4s)]
*  you know, tough comments about what's coming from our Israeli IDF spokesman and others on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=112.56s)]
*  our program earlier. So my question to you is where are civilians meant to go? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Where are they going? Are they getting the warnings in time? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=123.76s)]
*  Actually, we're having the same questions, honestly. If the Gaza Strip has no shelters, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=127.27999999999999s)]
*  has no bunkers, and has no safe zones. So when people hear that, I'm not sure they know exactly [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=133.76s)]
*  where to go, considering that Israeli attacks are cascading across the whole of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=141.92s)]
*  So I'm not sure how people will perceive this news and what to do with it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=149.2s)]
*  I don't deem it as really beneficial to people because, you know, the Gaza Strip is a small [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  coastal enclave and as it's all compromised with the Israeli attacks, people have no place to go [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=161.36s)]
*  besides the UNO-RWA schools. So it doesn't make sense to me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=168.8s)]
*  Are you all bracing for a ground assault? And as you've mentioned, I mean, basically what the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  Defense Minister said, that there is a total siege on those, you know, life-saving food, water, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=181.04s)]
*  fuel, electricity. Are you bracing for a ground assault? And again, have you got anything to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=186.48s)]
*  compare that with in your experience in the past? Of course, I witnessed all the past [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  escalations, or most of them. And just to talk to you from a personal perspective, it's like [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  bringing all the past bombardments and compounding them into one really 10 times or 100 times more [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  intense and larger escalation against the Gaza Strip, which is really leaving everybody, you know, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  to really frantically think of what might come next and what to do to seek, you know, safety. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  Again, everybody's going to start focusing in a few days on the ground assault. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=231.68s)]
*  And I think he's going to start focusing in a few days, no doubt, on the humanitarian situation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  The UN World Food Program called for the creation of humanitarian corridors, but that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=241.12s)]
*  doesn't seem likely possible at all now. Would you agree with that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=246.56s)]
*  What's really not just on ground is for the ground to tell you what are the needs. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  We're closely monitoring. Of course, it's very dangerous to actually be on ground [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=259.2s)]
*  and, you know, closely assess. So we're monitoring to see what's exactly happening so we can [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  hopefully see a fire where we can immediately prepare and implement humanitarian responses. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=271.12s)]
*  Yeah. For now, nothing is clear and, you know, you can't really decide anything. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=278.24s)]
*  Omar Horeb, we'll keep checking in. Thank you very much. Oxfam Inside Gaza City. Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN98JeHhmKk&t=284.4s)]
