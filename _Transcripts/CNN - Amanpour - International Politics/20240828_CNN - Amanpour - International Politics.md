Video Description: In recent history, the Balkans have directly benefited from NATO intervention, the alliance helping to end the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. So, with Ukraine fighting for its very existence, what can the NATO leaders currently gathering in Washington learn from this past? Christiane asked two people who know best: General Wesley Clark, who served as the Supreme Allied Commander at the time, and Albin Kurti, Kosovo's current Prime Minister.

# Lessons on NATO Intervention From Kosovo to Ukraine  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo)
*  I want to ask you to reflect on what NATO did and what Kosovo did all those years ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=0.0s)]
*  when General Clark was SACEUR, the head of NATO, and led a campaign to save and stabilize Kosovo. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=7.76s)]
*  Firstly, let me ask you, Prime Minister, because you've written about it. In a nutshell, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=16.72s)]
*  what did NATO do for your country? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=21.04s)]
*  Last month, we celebrated 25 years of liberation of our country, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=24.16s)]
*  and it wouldn't have been possible without NATO intervention, without NATO airplanes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=29.36s)]
*  bombing for 78 days police and military forces of the Serbian leader and Yugoslav president [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Slobodan Milošević. It was the fourth war that he was launching in the territory of former Yugoslavia [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=42.4s)]
*  throughout the 90s. Beforehand, there has been dozens of massacres against civilian population [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=50.24s)]
*  in Kosovo, where women, children, and elderly have been killed, women have been raped, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=58.32s)]
*  houses, villages, entire villages have been burned down, and all of this was within the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=65.6s)]
*  genocidal project of regime of Milošević to have Kosovo without its people, without Albania. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=72.08s)]
*  So, basically, they saw our country as a territory, not as people, and they wanted those people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=79.92s)]
*  either killed or out. And Operation Horseshoe was undergoing when basically NATO intervened and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=87.2s)]
*  stopped the genocide of Serbia. So, stopping the genocide and liberating our country and getting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=95.6s)]
*  the peace finally where one and the same thing enabled and later on guaranteed by NATO. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=103.76s)]
*  So, General Clark, given what we're watching in Ukraine and how reluctant NATO is to get involved [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=111.44s)]
*  for all the reasons that it won't get go head to head with Russia, can you walk us back to how the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=117.12s)]
*  decision was made to actually do what the prime minister has laid out to intervene in a way that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  ended this genocidal project? Well, we started when the genocide first began in the spring of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=129.68s)]
*  1998. NATO got engaged. NATO said you can't have security in Europe if you have an ongoing conflict. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  NATO said we've got to work outside the defensive boundaries of NATO member states [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=146.08s)]
*  in order to provide security for those member states. It's exactly the same situation as now, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=152.72s)]
*  but what's different is, of course, Russia was only indirectly involved in promoting Serb ethnic [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=158.8s)]
*  cleansing in 1999. Now they're directly involved. They are the aggressor, and it's been a matter of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=166.4s)]
*  mutual deterrence. Putin knows that we don't want a provocation that leads to a nuclear confrontation, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=175.44s)]
*  and so he continues to warn us by doing nuclear exercises and having his spokesmen talk about it, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=184.16s)]
*  and then he says, of course, it's not going to happen. He knows that NATO is fearful of this, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=191.28s)]
*  and yet this is the very purpose for which NATO was created to provide stability and security in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=197.84s)]
*  Europe. And I remember during the 50th anniversary, which occurred during the time this happened, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=204.32s)]
*  NATO was full of hand-wringing, doubt, concern. Oh my goodness, we're bombing a country, we're in a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=210.55999999999997s)]
*  war, should we stop it, should we have a pause, what can we do? There was all kinds of internal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=216.72s)]
*  struggle, and yet we persisted. NATO persisted because the United States as the leader persisted, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  and Britain was also, Prime Minister Blair was a big part of this, as well as Secretary Albright [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=230.56s)]
*  and President Clinton. We persisted, we didn't back off. This is the time NATO has to double down [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=237.04s)]
*  in terms of its resolve that Putin will not win, and we have to do more than simply provide [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=244.64s)]
*  a stream of weapons that are coming in fragmented, slowly, and so forth. NATO needs to do more. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=251.68s)]
*  Look at the example of Kosovo today, 25 years of democracy, a free country. I was there two [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=259.12s)]
*  weekends ago looking at people. Everybody has a horror story about it, just like the Prime Minister [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=266.56s)]
*  recounted, and everybody is grateful for NATO. It should be this way in Ukraine. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=272.56s)]
*  We can save Ukraine if we step up and do it, and that's our duty as NATO. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U1qs3q_Ipo&t=279.52s)]
