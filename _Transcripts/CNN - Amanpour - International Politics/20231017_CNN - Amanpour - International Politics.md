# “None of This Is Inevitable” HRW on Civilians in the Crossfire  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg)
*  Now, with so much of the focus on the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza, mass casualties, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=0.0s)]
*  population displacement and destruction, Gaza authorities say it's, quote, unlike anything [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=6.44s)]
*  seen in previous aggressions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=11.84s)]
*  That's their word. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=14.24s)]
*  Human Rights Watch program director Sari Bashi joins Hari Srinivasan to discuss the increasingly [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=15.52s)]
*  grave situation on the ground in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=21.44s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=26.0s)]
*  Sari Bashi, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=27.88s)]
*  Just recently, the UN Human Rights Commission said that the evacuation that Israel has ordered [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=29.88s)]
*  of the Palestinians would be a forcible transfer of civilians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=36.64s)]
*  Now, does that constitute a human rights violation? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=40.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=44.0s)]
*  So while warring armies are encouraged to warn civilians where such warning can actually [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=44.6s)]
*  help keep themselves safe, the evacuation order that the Israeli military issued on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=50.72s)]
*  Friday does not fit that category, and it risks civil transfer. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  And Friday, the Israeli army ordered a million people, nearly half of whom are children, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  to leave northern Gaza, that's half the population, and evacuate to the south. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=64.12s)]
*  But there's no safe place to go to because they continued bombing the south, and there's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=69.0s)]
*  no safe way to get there because they continued bombing even the evacuation routes that they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=74.6s)]
*  designated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  So under those circumstances, it's not effective warning. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=80.36s)]
*  It's not protecting civilians. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=83.88s)]
*  And it runs the risk of becoming forcible transfer, in particular because the Israeli [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=86.12s)]
*  military also encouraged Palestinians to flee to Egypt. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=91.72s)]
*  70% of the people living in Gaza are refugees from what is now Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  So some of the older people who were fleeing their homes on Friday remembered 75 years [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=101.56s)]
*  ago fleeing homes in southern Israel as the Israeli army then approached, and they also [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=106.92s)]
*  remember that they were not allowed to come back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=112.12s)]
*  So what are the consequences here if Israel continues to carry these actions out? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=114.91999999999999s)]
*  Because right now, they seem to have a military plan in place, and it's a matter of time before [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=120.28s)]
*  they launch what would be a ground offensive. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=127.16s)]
*  So none of this is inevitable. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  The United States is supplying the Israeli military with $3.8 billion in military aid [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=132.2s)]
*  every year, and they're now rushing additional weapons. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=138.84s)]
*  They're also providing Israel with political cover and a diplomatic cover. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=141.56s)]
*  The United States has an opportunity to be very specific in telling Israel that it needs [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=146.36s)]
*  to protect civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=152.2s)]
*  And those specifics would first of all be to cancel the evacuation order and to protect [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=154.28s)]
*  civilians irrespective of where they are. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=159.56s)]
*  Many people in northern Gaza did not leave, either because they couldn't. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=161.88s)]
*  They're older people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=166.2s)]
*  They're people with disabilities. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=167.16s)]
*  They're hospital patients because the main hospital in Gaza is in the evacuation zone, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=168.6s)]
*  or they chose not to because they were facing impossible choices, and the conditions in the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=173.48s)]
*  south are not good, to say the least. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=178.04s)]
*  Those people retain their civilian protections. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=180.6s)]
*  So if the Israeli military does launch a ground invasion, it may not target or indiscriminately [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=183.88s)]
*  attack them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=189.24s)]
*  The second thing the United States government needs to ask the Israeli government, tell the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  Israeli government to do immediately, is to restore fuel, electricity, water, and food [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=195.0s)]
*  supplies to Gaza. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=201.32s)]
*  Those have been cut since October 7. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=202.6s)]
*  Collective punishment, which is what denying the supplies are, and forcible transfer, are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  war crimes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=211.0s)]
*  And I want to be very clear. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=212.27999999999997s)]
*  What Hamas-led fighters did on October 7 was an unspeakable war crime. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=213.72s)]
*  They massacred Israeli civilians. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  They took hostage children, people with disabilities, babies, older people. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=220.44s)]
*  It was unspeakable. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=225.8s)]
*  But the fact that the other side is committing war crimes doesn't mean that you get to commit [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=227.32s)]
*  war crimes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=232.92s)]
*  And it needs to be very clear that Israel has to protect civilians in Gaza who are suffering [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=233.96s)]
*  very, very difficult circumstances. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=240.44s)]
*  When you look at this from the outside, it seems like the ideas about the laws of war, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  what's fair, what's not fair, seem to have been written for an era where you could tell [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=250.28s)]
*  who the soldiers were because they were wearing this color uniform and they were standing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=255.16s)]
*  opposite a field from you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=259.96s)]
*  But now, you know, one of the concerns that Israel has is, how do I tell who's a civilian [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=261.48s)]
*  and how do I tell who's not? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=267.0s)]
*  I see it a bit differently. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  When you cut water to a population of 2.2 million people, nearly half of whom are children, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=271.4s)]
*  you know exactly what that's going to do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=278.12s)]
*  That's not about security. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=280.52s)]
*  That's collective punishment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  And it's matched by statements by the defense minister saying that they are going to have [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=283.88s)]
*  a total siege of Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=287.96s)]
*  When you drop weapons in densely populated areas, explosive weapons that have wide area [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  effects, it is predictable that you will kill civilians. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=296.28s)]
*  It is predictable that you will kill children. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=300.76s)]
*  And that's what's happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=303.88s)]
*  Nearly 3,000 people in Gaza have been killed, about a third of them children. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=305.4s)]
*  Since October 7th, Israeli airstrikes have been killing 100 children a day in Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=309.88s)]
*  There's no—the problem is not the laws of war. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=316.76s)]
*  The problem is the lack of consistency. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  The very same outrage that appropriately made Israelis, Americans so horrified by what [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=323.0s)]
*  Hamas-led fighters did to Israeli civilians on October 7th, needs to be the same principle [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=329.48s)]
*  that applies to civilians in Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  At Human Rights Watch, we're trying to hold open a narrow space of universal principles. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=338.12s)]
*  Civilians need to be protected. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=343.16s)]
*  It doesn't matter if they're Israeli. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=344.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter if they're Palestinian. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=346.20000000000005s)]
*  Children need to be protected. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=348.44s)]
*  That's not hard, or it shouldn't be hard. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=351.48s)]
*  Recently, Hamas posted a video of one of the hostages that they're holding. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=354.92s)]
*  What are the conditions that Hamas needs to meet with those people? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=359.32s)]
*  How should they be treated during this time? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=363.8s)]
*  So the first thing that Hamas should do is unconditionally release all the civilians [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=367.56s)]
*  it's holding hostage. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=371.56s)]
*  Hostage-taking as a war crime, it's abhorrent. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=372.76s)]
*  And we know that the hostages they have include people with disabilities, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=375.72s)]
*  include older people. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=379.48s)]
*  I think the oldest one is 85. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=380.92s)]
*  I think the youngest one is nine months old. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=382.92s)]
*  They need to be released immediately and unconditionally. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=385.32s)]
*  So long as they are in Hamas custody, they need to be treated humanely. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=388.12s)]
*  And that's not what's happening. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=391.88s)]
*  Last week, the Hamas military wing threatened to execute civilians if the airstrikes continue. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=393.32s)]
*  That in itself is a war crime. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=400.76s)]
*  You have been living in and studying what's been happening in the Middle East for [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=402.52s)]
*  decades now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=407.88s)]
*  And I wonder, I guess, just as a Jewish woman who is married to a Palestinian man, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=408.92s)]
*  what's been going through your head for the past week? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, when this all happened, first happened on Saturday, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=421.64s)]
*  I had to address my children's questions. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  Why was their cousin so scared? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=428.92s)]
*  Why was their grandmother trying to evacuate? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=430.76s)]
*  What was happening? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=433.24s)]
*  And I told my daughter what I always told her, that there are abuses taking place against [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  Palestinians, but that there is never any justification for killing people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=442.28s)]
*  And that some people who oppose what the Israeli government is doing to Palestinians [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=447.64s)]
*  killed a lot of people. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=452.84s)]
*  And that was horrific. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=454.2s)]
*  My daughter gets it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=457.4s)]
*  My daughter understands that people are people and that you don't have different standards for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=458.84s)]
*  Israelis or Palestinians. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=464.2s)]
*  She understands that we're all human beings because she loves people on both sides. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=466.11999999999995s)]
*  And one of the things I'm worried about is the us versus them discourse that we're seeing, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  certainly in Israel, but also in the United States. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=478.12s)]
*  It becomes a, but they're worse than we are. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that's neither constructive nor particularly normal. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=483.23999999999995s)]
*  We have obligations as human beings to protect civilians and to protect other human beings. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=487.4s)]
*  And that's the only way we're going to get out of this because this violence didn't come [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=493.23999999999995s)]
*  in a vacuum. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=497.88s)]
*  It came after decades of repression of Palestinians by the Israeli government that in no way [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=498.92s)]
*  justifies what was done. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  It's important to recognize that if we want this to stop, we need to address those root causes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  The Israeli government for decades has been engaging in forcible transfer of Palestinians [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=513.0s)]
*  in the West Bank, taking their land, setting it aside for Jewish settlers. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=518.76s)]
*  That all needs to stop the day after this war ends. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=524.2s)]
*  And right now the United States government has particular responsibilities to emphasize [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=528.52s)]
*  those universal principles, the principles that my nine-year-old gets, but unfortunately, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=534.36s)]
*  big grownups don't seem to get. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=539.24s)]
*  So what can be done considering at this point there have been perhaps war crimes committed, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=541.88s)]
*  but by the time any of these war crimes are prosecuted, the damage is already done. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=547.48s)]
*  Do we have any kind of levers or mechanisms where we can prevent them from continuing to happen? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=553.08s)]
*  So first of all, we have asked the International Criminal Court prosecutor [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=559.48s)]
*  to issue preventive warnings. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=563.72s)]
*  There's an ongoing investigation, both of crimes by Hamas and other armed groups of Gaza, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=565.72s)]
*  as well as by the Israeli military. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=570.84s)]
*  And there's an opportunity for him to issue a warning saying, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=572.76s)]
*  we are concerned that further crimes are being committed. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=576.6s)]
*  Please stop. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=579.0s)]
*  And that can have an effect. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=579.96s)]
*  The U.S. government can do the same thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=581.48s)]
*  JANIS-LOUIS RUIZ, U.S. Secretary of State, US, President Biden, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=583.08s)]
*  Biden is supposed to be in Israel for a few hours. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=583.96s)]
*  What should he be saying there? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=585.96s)]
*  NADJA DROST, U.S. Secretary of State, US, President Biden, President Biden, President [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=587.72s)]
*  Biden should say to cancel the evacuation order from Friday, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=589.08s)]
*  stop dropping explosive weapons in densely populated urban areas, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=592.44s)]
*  because we know if you do that, you will kill civilians, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=598.2s)]
*  and immediately restore supplies of food, fuel, water and electricity. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=601.32s)]
*  That's for right now. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=606.12s)]
*  And later on, we can talk about some of the root causes of what's going on right now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=607.48s)]
*  And other countries should look at their atrocity prevention measures. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=611.88s)]
*  You know, countries have measures where they look at statements of concern [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  by different governments, including the statements we've seen recently [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  from Israeli officials. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=625.32s)]
*  And they have mechanisms they can use to try to rein that in, to express strong concern. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  I can very much understand how horrified people and also policymakers [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  in the United States and Europe are by what Hamas-led fighters did to Israeli civilians. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=641.16s)]
*  But they need to be very clear that what's happening now in Gaza cannot continue. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=647.16s)]
*  Civilians need to be protected full stop. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=652.8399999999999s)]
*  What do you expect to happen next? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=655.0s)]
*  I think a lot of it depends on what the United States decides to do. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=658.28s)]
*  I think if the United States decides that it will rein in the Israeli military [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=661.64s)]
*  and ask them to, for example, restore supplies to civilians, to protect civilians, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=667.32s)]
*  I think there's a chance that things could get better. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=672.5200000000001s)]
*  If they don't, I'm very worried. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=675.48s)]
*  It seems in some ways human nature that when you are hurt, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=677.72s)]
*  you turn around and try to hurt others, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=682.7600000000001s)]
*  That you punch back or you feel like the best defense is a good offense. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=685.24s)]
*  How do you stop that cycle from perpetuating? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=691.08s)]
*  You adhere to basic principles. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=696.2s)]
*  You asked if the laws of war are still valid, if they're still appropriate. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=698.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=703.0s)]
*  There are books written about it, but it's actually very simple. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=704.84s)]
*  You have to protect civilians. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=708.12s)]
*  You have to protect the people who have nothing to do with the fighting. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=709.96s)]
*  That's the principle that children can understand. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=716.44s)]
*  When I tell my daughter, I know your brother hit you, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=719.08s)]
*  but that doesn't mean you could hit him back. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=721.32s)]
*  I think we can have a very simple message to the Israeli government. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  I know Hamas committed unspeakable war crimes against Israeli civilians. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=727.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean you can commit war crimes against Palestinian civilians. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about what it's like for your kids growing up in the West Bank [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=734.2s)]
*  with an Israeli parent and a Palestinian parent. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=739.48s)]
*  What is their kind of day-to-day existence like where they see the effects of being [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=742.52s)]
*  from two sides? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=749.24s)]
*  I think it makes them better human beings. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=750.12s)]
*  My children understand that there are principles of basic humanity, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=753.24s)]
*  and they understand that because they love Palestinians and they love Israeli Jews. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=757.72s)]
*  They have two sets of grandparents. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=762.68s)]
*  They have relatives. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=764.68s)]
*  They have friends. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=765.48s)]
*  They're able to walk that beautiful but narrowing space where human beings are human beings. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=767.0s)]
*  I think we have an opportunity to follow in their footsteps. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=774.6s)]
*  We have an opportunity to apply those same basic principles to the policies and decisions [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=777.72s)]
*  that are being made right now. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=783.48s)]
*  I'm very proud of my children, and I think that certainly some policymakers have a lot [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=785.08s)]
*  to learn from them. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=790.12s)]
*  This operation seems to be much larger than what happened back in 2014, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=791.64s)]
*  and I'm wondering what your biggest concerns are about the scale of what's happening now. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=799.08s)]
*  I'm worried that there's not going to be much left. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=805.72s)]
*  This is all absolutely unprecedented. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=808.52s)]
*  The massacres and hostage-taking of October 7th were the worst civilian massacres in Israeli [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=811.8s)]
*  history, and there are now at least 199 Israelis being held in captivity in Gaza. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=816.84s)]
*  The destruction being done in Gaza, both of civilian infrastructure, hospital schools, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=826.28s)]
*  roads, but more to the point in terms of people's lives, is irreversible. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=832.3599999999999s)]
*  We're moving to a place where very basic principles of humanity are being eroded very, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=843.0s)]
*  very quickly, and that's why we need to move very quickly to stop that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=848.52s)]
*  Program Director for Human Rights Watch, Sari Bashi. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=853.64s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=856.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=857.4799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_InBTHz1ldg&t=861.8s)]
