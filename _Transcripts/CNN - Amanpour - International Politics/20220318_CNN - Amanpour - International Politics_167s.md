Video Description: Putin’s war on Ukraine grinds on, into its fourth week. Civilian casualties are mounting, families have been ripped apart, and vast areas are destroyed. President Zelensky says Putin has turned his country’s sky into a source of death. But whether Putin wins or loses, it’s clear there’s no returning to the status quo ante. What will emerge from this crisis in the center of Europe? The fate of democracy is at stake. What can a new world order look like? Scholar and author Francis Fukuyama joins the show to discuss whether the U.S.-led world order can survive -- and whether America has the moral authority and the will to lead.

# Can a U.S.-Led World Order Survive After Ukraine?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A)
*  Well, unfortunately, this sounds like a cliche, but I really do think there's a fork here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=0.0s)]
*  where we could go in two very different directions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=6.58s)]
*  If Putin is successful in his plan of basically unseating the democratically elected regime [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  in Kiev and putting a puppet government in there, and if nothing really happens to him [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=16.28s)]
*  to stop that, then we are going to be back in the situation of the 20th century where [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  military force is used to forcibly change borders. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=28.28s)]
*  On the other hand, if he gets bogged down, if he starts taking casualties at a rate that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=32.72s)]
*  is unsustainable for him, he may actually have to pull back in a very humiliating way, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=39.6s)]
*  and that would demonstrate the solidity of the NATO alliance, the ability of democracies [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=45.32s)]
*  to push back the weakness of this authoritarian regime, and that might give actually a second [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  boost to the spirit of 1989 and the spirit of democracy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=57.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, at the moment, we don't know which of these two futures is really [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=62.2s)]
*  going to unfold. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  So let's take them both. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=67.08s)]
*  First, the latter one, if he gets bogged down, and frankly, if he loses. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=68.08s)]
*  Most people are saying that he will lose whatever and that he has torn up our world order. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  We live in a Putin world right now, win or lose, and there is no return to the status [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=80.08s)]
*  which I take to mean there may be no return to a US led liberal world order as was created [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=85.77999999999999s)]
*  out of the ashes of World War II. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=94.78s)]
*  Well, if the second scenario unfolds, I don't know that that's really what's going to happen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  It may not be US led in the way that it was during the Cold War, because I think that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=103.66s)]
*  our polarization leads to a kind of political weakness that hurts our credibility. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=108.78s)]
*  But Germany, for example, has turned around completely. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=115.3s)]
*  It's now got a strong foreign policy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=119.22s)]
*  They're going to double their defense expenditures. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of agreement within the NATO alliance to push back, and that could do a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=124.14s)]
*  lot to restore a kind of rules-based liberal democratic world order. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=129.38s)]
*  And that is not going to be one that Vladimir Putin determines, and we don't have to live [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=135.54s)]
*  in his shadow. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=143.1s)]
*  So I think that there could be some optimistic outcomes, but again, it really depends on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=144.6s)]
*  the outcome on the battlefield. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXItFs5NV-A&t=150.06s)]
