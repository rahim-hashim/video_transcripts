*  First, let's start off with a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=45.7s)]
*  little bit of news this week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=46.46s)]
*  There were reports that Kim [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=47.56s)]
*  Jong-un could meet with Russia [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=50.34s)]
*  for a possible arms deal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  Yes, and it would make sense, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=57.08s)]
*  although when Kim Jong-un met [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=59.0s)]
*  Putin for the first and only [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  time, Kim Jong-un felt, well, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=62.46s)]
*  not properly respected because [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=65.94s)]
*  Putin the next day flew down to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=67.8s)]
*  Beijing to attend a major [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=69.98s)]
*  conference while leaving his [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=71.98s)]
*  foreign guest in his home [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=75.38s)]
*  But today we're living in a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=76.58s)]
*  different world since Russia's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=78.28s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine, the old, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=80.42s)]
*  the former Cold War dynamics of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=82.97999999999999s)]
*  Moscow, Beijing, and Pyongyang [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=85.08s)]
*  standing against the other team, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=87.74s)]
*  Team USA with Japan and South [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=89.72s)]
*  Korea on its side. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  That dynamic has returned in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=93.32s)]
*  full force and national [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=95.46s)]
*  interests, of course, override [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=97.46s)]
*  any wounded pride. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=99.52s)]
*  And North Korea wants to sell [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=101.22s)]
*  arms to Russia, and Russia needs [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=103.56s)]
*  those North Korean ammunition [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=105.66s)]
*  and artillery. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=107.9s)]
*  So North Korean ammunition and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=109.3s)]
*  artillery could be used in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=111.44s)]
*  either what, backstopping [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=113.94s)]
*  Russia's arsenal or actually used [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=115.54s)]
*  in the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=118.84s)]
*  I think the latter and the Biden [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=121.2s)]
*  administration has quite [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  repeatedly alleged, stated that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=124.98s)]
*  North Korea has been secretly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=128.24s)]
*  supplying arms to Russia since [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=130.34s)]
*  February 2022. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=132.78s)]
*  When it comes to a potential arms [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=135.22s)]
*  deal with Russia, I mean, is [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=136.68s)]
*  North Korea interested in this [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=138.96s)]
*  in any part to just be a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=141.62s)]
*  thorn in the side of the West in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  addition to selling arms? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=147.54s)]
*  Well, there's that element, too. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=149.34s)]
*  Of course, North Korea wants to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=151.14s)]
*  be taken more seriously, although [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=152.68s)]
*  all of North Korea's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  interlocutors, including the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=156.84s)]
*  United States, take North Korea [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=158.56s)]
*  quite seriously in view of their [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=160.48s)]
*  capabilities. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=162.28s)]
*  But North Korea has another [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  agenda, which is to swap [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=165.5s)]
*  ammunition, artillery and so on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=169.45999999999998s)]
*  in return for higher military [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=172.26s)]
*  technology, ICBM technology, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=174.62s)]
*  submarine-launched missile [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=177.22s)]
*  technology from Russia. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=178.62s)]
*  So these national interests on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  the part of Russia and North [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Korea override any tensions, any [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  diplomatic protocol, any concern [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=189.7s)]
*  of violation of numerous UN [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=192.9s)]
*  Security Council resolutions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=195.1s)]

*  ballistic missiles. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=201.68s)]
*  But North Korea has completely [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  ignored such resolutions and on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  over 100 occasions have shot [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=207.42000000000002s)]

*  2022. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  And what does Russia say? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  What does China say? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=216.8s)]
*  Nothing. In fact, the two big [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=218.08s)]
*  nations, Russia and China, have [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  worked together, cooperated to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=222.04000000000002s)]

*  North Korea. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=232.52s)]
*  your new book. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=234.64s)]
*  This is called The Sister, and it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=235.8s)]

*  Tell us a little bit about Kim [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeo-jung. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, Kim Yeo-jung, the sister of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=257.84s)]
*  the current North Korean [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=259.84s)]

*  Because in 2018, there was a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=604.28s)]
*  historic meeting between the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=605.88s)]
*  North and the South. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=607.24s)]
*  Kim Jong-un came, he was the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=608.08s)]
*  first leader to do so in [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=609.28s)]
*  decades. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=610.32s)]
*  And that was also the year that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=611.32s)]
*  President Trump met with the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=613.12s)]
*  North Korean leader. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=614.92s)]
*  So where does she fit? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=616.04s)]
*  What's her role? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=618.0s)]
*  Well, I think Kim Yeo-jung is an [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=619.36s)]
*  unprecedented diplomatic weapon [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=621.32s)]
*  in the North Korean diplomatic [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=624.04s)]
*  toolbox. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=625.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=626.24s)]
*  By virtue, simply by virtue of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=627.16s)]
*  her identity, her relative youth. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=629.48s)]
*  In 2018, she was barely 30 years [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=632.24s)]
*  old and her gender, you know, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  she brings this unprecedented, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  softer, feminine glow to the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  very brutish, cold, macabre [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  image that is her despotic [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=645.2s)]
*  regime. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=647.1600000000001s)]
*  So I think the tendency, the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  latent patronization, the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=651.2s)]
*  tendency to patronize young [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=653.6s)]
*  women, sexism, you know, latent [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=655.48s)]
*  in many of us, I would suggest [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=657.88s)]
*  that for men and women is an [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=659.88s)]
*  advantage to the Kim regime. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=662.84s)]
*  You know, it's easier to stomach, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=665.52s)]
*  to swallow insults coming from a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=667.84s)]
*  young, pretty woman than her [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=670.6800000000001s)]
*  less photogenic and dour [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=673.84s)]
*  looking brother. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=675.84s)]
*  So, you know, she casts a softer [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=676.84s)]
*  glow on her regime and what she [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=680.24s)]
*  says seems to strike many as [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=682.24s)]
*  genuine and real. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  So what she did in 2018 to set [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=686.64s)]
*  her stage for her brother's [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=689.24s)]
*  debut on the international stage [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=691.24s)]
*  in his campaign to win many [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=693.64s)]
*  concessions from the U.S. and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=696.8399999999999s)]
*  from South Korea and other [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  countries. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=699.8399999999999s)]
*  She's taken on this role and I [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  think she relishes it being [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=703.24s)]
*  under the spotlight issuing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=705.24s)]
*  various condemnations against [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=707.04s)]
*  world leaders, stating her [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=708.64s)]
*  nation's undying support that [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=711.24s)]
*  they will, North Korea will [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=714.04s)]
*  always stand in the same [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=715.4399999999999s)]
*  interest as the heroic soldiers [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=717.64s)]
*  and people of Russia referring [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=719.84s)]
*  to the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=722.24s)]
*  So I think she's quite enjoying [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=724.24s)]
*  herself being out there. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=725.84s)]
*  There was the case of the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=727.84s)]
*  American college student Otto [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  Warmbier and I wonder, he gave [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=731.24s)]
*  a forced confession and you say [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=734.24s)]
*  that this had Kim Yo-jong's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=736.04s)]
*  fingerprints all over it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=737.4399999999999s)]
*  Explain. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  So at the time Kim Yo-jong had [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  been running her nation's very [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=741.84s)]
*  powerful propaganda and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=743.4399999999999s)]

*  we've seen some real vile, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=748.84s)]
*  homophobic, racist, sexist [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=751.0400000000001s)]
*  insults hurled against variously [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=754.0400000000001s)]

*  President Obama and also [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=766.6400000000001s)]
*  against the then South Korean [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=768.6400000000001s)]
*  female president, the first [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=770.6400000000001s)]

*  East Asia. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=774.04s)]
*  Otto Warmbier was detained, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  taken hostage in January 2016 [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=778.4399999999999s)]

*  and then North Korea made all [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  these trumped up charges, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  obviously pushed Otto Warmbier [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  to give a coerced confession [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=790.64s)]
*  and so on and because Kim Yo-jong [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  was in charge, the de facto [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=796.04s)]

*  Korean regime, to insult the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=823.84s)]

*  None of this is true and, you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=826.84s)]

*  studied the issue carefully. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=849.64s)]
*  So, yeah, the whole unpleasant, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=851.0400000000001s)]
*  very cruel case has her signature [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=854.24s)]
*  all over it, I would suggest. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=856.44s)]
*  Do you think that the father was [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=858.64s)]

*  Well, North Korea, you know, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=888.84s)]
*  pretends to be a communist system [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS_xCrclZzA&t=891.24s)]
