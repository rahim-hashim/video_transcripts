Video Description: Just 25 years ago, the Good Friday Agreement put an end to decades of violence and brought peace to Northern Ireland. The accord's enduring success has made it a model for peace negotiations across the world. The architects of that groundbreaking pact were former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern. In a historic reunion, Blair, Clinton and Ahern sat down with Christiane for an exclusive interview reflecting on the hard choices they made to achieve peace and stability for the beleaguered nation.

Originally aired on April 17, 2023.

# EXCLUSIVE: Clinton, Blair and Ahern Reflect on the Good Friday Agreement | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI)
*  Well, I think we were all privileged to be where we were when we were and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=0.0s)]
*  privileged to do our part to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Get this done. They actually had to sign the agreement, you know, I was just a cheerleader sort of and gave him George Mitchell [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=7.96s)]
*  Which was the gift of a generation. So I think we're proud. I hope we are Prime Minister Blair. This was something [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=15.68s)]
*  that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=23.6s)]
*  wrecked many British governments before yours [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=24.78s)]
*  But I was lucky in in having a group of people in Northern Ireland leaders who were prepared to lead and do difficult things [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=28.26s)]
*  I had an Irish T shock an Irish Prime Minister [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=34.7s)]
*  that had a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=38.7s)]
*  you know, we were coming to the end of the 20th century and you needed people with a kind of 21st century mentality of the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=39.9s)]
*  World and Bertie had that and then I mean President Clinton was saying that he was a cheerleader, but he was actually much more than that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=46.14s)]
*  He was also an intervener at crucial points in the negotiation. So we were lucky [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=51.94s)]
*  It's one of these things you think I think it's a was a combination of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=56.74s)]
*  Circumstances but the individual leadership of people at that particular moment was crucial in delivering it [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  And Prime Minister Hearn was it that mostly the alignment of the stars so to speak in terms of leadership [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=68.34s)]
*  Was it also about the people on the ground? Yeah, the parties have people in the ground of I think from our point of view [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=73.94s)]
*  To have the present United States been genuinely interested and bill to give time and to stay up at night [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=81.42s)]
*  I mean, we're you know, we are a small country and you know the things you don't expect and I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=87.68s)]
*  Was just so lucky that Tony and I got on so well. He gave just an enormous amount of time [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=92.98s)]
*  I know you'd a hundred other items on this list and you know, I realize every Prime Minister is busy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=99.02s)]
*  But when I looked at my agenda against his agenda and he was prepared to come here spend days here weeks here hours and you know [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=105.18s)]
*  Time and time again people talk about 1998 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  But we went on to 2007 and the same commitment you gave Tony and that that was an extraordinary commitment [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=116.9s)]
*  Can I ask the origin story? So President Clinton even in your campaign, you know before the the 92 election [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=123.9s)]
*  You talked about this to Irish Americans you said you would put all your abilities behind trying to to get peace [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  Why why did it matter so much even in 92? First of all, I was a student at Oxford when the troubles began. I [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=137.78s)]
*  remember what a big story it was when Bernadette Devlin was elected to Parliament and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=144.9s)]
*  I remembered and I went to Ireland a couple of times while I was a student and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  I saw both the happiness and the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=157.14s)]
*  sorrow and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=160.74s)]
*  I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=162.85999999999999s)]
*  Always felt [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  When I started talking to Irish Americans when I was running for president [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=168.1s)]
*  That we can make a positive difference if we were fair [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=173.22s)]
*  to both sides and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=176.9s)]
*  I [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=179.18s)]
*  Knew that to do that we'd have to do something that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=181.18s)]
*  this the side that was then prevailing would think was unfair which was to get involved because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=184.66s)]
*  The our whole diplomacy was built around [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=190.02s)]
*  our special relationship with the UK which included staying away from Ireland [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  Even when President Kennedy came here, he didn't talk about Northern Ireland and no president ever spent the night in Northern Ireland [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  So I did stayed in the Europa on purpose because they had been bombed so much [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=206.78s)]
*  And so I give a lot of credit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  To the Irish Americans that urged me to do it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=216.7s)]
*  and to the people in my National Security Council [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=220.34s)]
*  Especially Nancy Soderbergh was here today and who worked this issue for me who? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=226.22s)]
*  Said you know you might not have a lot of experience in foreign policy, but your instincts are right on this day [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=233.18s)]
*  and so we took the heat and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=239.1s)]
*  Even the British ambassador then Admiral Crowe had been chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Reagan and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=243.14s)]
*  Stunned the world including me when he endorsed me for president and he called me [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=249.77999999999997s)]
*  He said you gave me this great job, and now you're making it impossible for me to do I said no Admiral [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=254.14s)]
*  You're gonna be more important than ever. This is a good thing so your US ambassador had his marching orders from you um [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=259.3s)]
*  Prime Minister Blair here you are you have you have come in as a as a labor prime minister for the first time in a generation [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=266.14000000000004s)]
*  and you have an overwhelming mandate and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=273.42s)]
*  You start by doing this. I mean it's you were elected in 97 the negotiations started in 97. Why why was it so important to you? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=277.22s)]
*  To put that much political capital, I mean there was a personal reason actually to a degree [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=287.54s)]
*  Rather like the the president. I mean my family on my mother's side to come from Donegal [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=293.74s)]
*  I'd grown up with a very clear understanding of the the troubles [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=300.58s)]
*  And you know you would wait literally every morning in the 1970s 1980s [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  1990s [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=310.14s)]
*  to use on on the UK media of acts of terrorism and destruction death [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  Store tragic stories of the families of the victims of the troubles [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=317.86s)]
*  So it was all it was part of my own personal history, but I also thought you know John Major who'd be my [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=321.98s)]
*  predecessor as Prime Minister had tried and and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=328.74s)]
*  Got somewhere there was some stirring you could see some possibility even though the thing had broken down by the time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=331.82000000000005s)]
*  We came to office, and I thought I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=337.54s)]
*  Mean I've often wondered whether it was just [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=340.38000000000005s)]
*  Because you was straight into government and maybe the the you know you had this feeling that everything was possible [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=343.22s)]
*  And so you were prepared to give what most people thought was impossible ago [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=349.06s)]
*  So what for all of those reasons that the first speech I made as Prime Minister was was here in Northern Ireland [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=352.82s)]
*  and then you know we [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=359.78s)]
*  Once we decided to work on it. We've put a lot a lot into it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=362.54s)]
*  You [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FGYFJBJCtI&t=372.5s)]
