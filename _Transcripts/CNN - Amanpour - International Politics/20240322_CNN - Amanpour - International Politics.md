# Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Gaza & the 2024 Election A Look at US Foreign Policy  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY)
*  Let's turn now to a day of U.S. diplomatic efforts to push for peace in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=0.0s)]
*  A delta blow by the U.N. Security Council once again, who failed to pass a U.S. resolution [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=5.84s)]
*  calling for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=11.16s)]
*  It was a major tonal shift for the White House after months of vetoing other resolutions, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=13.48s)]
*  suggesting a departure from previous policy towards Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=18.2s)]
*  This while U.S. military aid to Ukraine continues to hang in the balance in Congress as a prospect [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=22.48s)]
*  of another Trump presidency casts a shadow over Ukraine's future on the battlefield as [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=27.8s)]
*  we've just been discussing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=32.6s)]
*  President of the Council on Foreign Relations joins Walter Isaacson to discuss how shifting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=34.88s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy is resonating in Washington and beyond. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=39.24s)]
*  Thank you, Biana and Michael Froman. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  This week, Congress has still been wrestling with Ukraine aid. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=49.58s)]
*  Now there's an idea that maybe it should be a loan that's perhaps waivable. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=53.2s)]
*  How important is it to you that they settle it? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  And is this idea of doing it as a loan, does that make sense? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think it is absolutely critical that they settle it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  That's perhaps the most important thing that Ukraine knows that the money is going to be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=69.76s)]
*  there, that Russia knows that the support is going to be there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=75.0s)]
*  I think it is significantly better for it to be a grant as it has been before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=79.22s)]
*  But the most important thing is for Congress to act and to demonstrate that the U.S. stands [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=84.02s)]
*  behind Ukraine at this critical moment. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=89.3s)]
*  Even if this happens, it seems like this is not going to be a forever thing, certainly [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=92.42s)]
*  if Donald Trump is elected. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  But even now, it looks unlikely that they'll continue to do aid year after year. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=98.44s)]
*  Do you think it's time to have some peace process that would try to at least get us [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  to a truce or a standstill? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=109.62s)]
*  Or what should we be doing? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=113.1s)]
*  I think ultimately everybody wants to get there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=114.74s)]
*  I think the question is, do you get there with Ukrainians coming to the table from a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=119.46s)]
*  position of strength or from a position of weakness? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=124.42s)]
*  If Congress does not act, they'll be coming to the table from a position of weakness. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=127.14s)]
*  If Congress does act and have the wherewithal to get through this year to try and make as [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=132.46s)]
*  many gains as they can on the battlefield, and very importantly, to avoid problems on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=137.98s)]
*  the battlefield, prevent Russia from making gains on the battlefield, then there's at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  least some hope that when the parties decide that negotiations are appropriate, that there'll [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=148.42s)]
*  be a decent outcome. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=154.3s)]
*  I think the risk right now is that without the support from Congress, Ukraine may be [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=155.9s)]
*  forced to the table in a way that's very much disadvantageous. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=161.02s)]
*  Well, so if you do get to the table, what do you think an outcome could be? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=163.9s)]
*  Well, it's going to be a very hard set of issues. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=168.94s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole range. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=172.06s)]
*  It's hard to imagine Russia giving up territory that it has gained, and it's hard to imagine [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  the Ukrainians accepting that as a long-term proposition. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  I think one idea that has been put out there is something not unlike what happened in the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=184.62s)]
*  Korean Peninsula at the end of the Korean War, where there was a truce but not a final [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=189.98s)]
*  peace settlement, and there was a series of compromises and security guarantees that allowed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=194.54s)]
*  both sides to find it acceptable. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=200.62s)]
*  The Ukrainians will not be happy about that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=204.38s)]
*  They'll be giving up both the Eastern Ukraine and Crimea even in the short run. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=206.14s)]
*  It's not something they're politically prepared to do, but I think what will be determining [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  this is how much progress there is on the ground and how much the Russians feel the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=216.46s)]
*  need to make a compromise. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  I think one thing that could change the dynamic, Walter, is that if—I think President Putin [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  believes that time is on his side, both because Russia has dug into very strong defensive [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  positions in Eastern Ukraine and because, frankly, he's waiting to see what the outcome [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=237.9s)]
*  of the U.S. election is and whether the support will be there from Congress in the meantime. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=242.94s)]
*  I think one thing that could change that is if President Putin felt he was losing some [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=249.74s)]
*  control over Crimea, which is, of course, extremely important to him and to Russia and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=254.38s)]
*  his image of Russia. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=261.58s)]
*  If the wherewithal that we provide Ukraine gives them the capability of shaking some of that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=263.42s)]
*  security around Crimea, then that could potentially bring President Putin to the table earlier. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  … Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed at the request of President Biden [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=275.34s)]
*  to send a delegation to Washington to talk about whether or not to do a military operation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=282.62s)]
*  in Ra'a Fah and how to do it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  What do you hope comes out of these discussions? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  I think, hopefully, that will turn the temperature down a bit between the United States and Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=296.3s)]
*  The U.S. is now Israel's, really, if not the only source of support. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=304.3s)]
*  Certainly, it's the strongest remaining source of support. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=309.42s)]
*  And we've seen that fray with Senator Schumer's speech and the general tension between the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  administration and Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=319.98s)]
*  So hopefully turn down the temperature. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=323.42s)]
*  I think that has to be related to actually substantive progress on the underlying issues, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=325.34s)]
*  which is, on one hand, of course, Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=329.9s)]
*  Israel has the right to try and eliminate Hamas as a security threat on its border. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=333.73999999999995s)]
*  The question is, at this point on the verge of going into Ra'a Fah, will there be a strong [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  humanitarian element to that operation? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=347.5s)]
*  What happens to the million or so Gazans who are being asked to go back to the North, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=350.38s)]
*  who are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=356.3s)]
*  Back in the North, 70 percent of the buildings have been damaged. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=358.94s)]
*  So where are they going back to, and will there be a housing component to that? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=362.38s)]
*  Can we get humanitarian aid into Gaza in a meaningful way? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=366.06s)]
*  And that means beyond air drops, beyond building a port into the Mediterranean Sea, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=370.38s)]
*  really opening up the roads, both from Egypt and potentially from the North, from Israel, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=377.26s)]
*  for significant truck traffic, to bring in the food and the other humanitarian supplies [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  that are so desperately needed. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=388.78s)]
*  And of course, we're not talking as much as we should be talking about the hostages. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=391.18s)]
*  How do we get the hundred or so hostages that remain in Gaza under Hamas control out and safely home? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=395.5s)]
*  Well, let's talk about humanitarian aid, because I don't get it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's a famine, there's widespread deep hunger in Gaza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=406.3s)]
*  Why would the U.S. and Israel not want to try to get humanitarian aid in as fast as possible? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=411.74s)]
*  Like I said, very much in the U.S. interest and Israel's interest to do so. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=419.26s)]
*  I think what we've seen is that the trucks that have come to the border, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=425.26s)]
*  to the Rafa crossing, have been turned away sometimes for having [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=429.1s)]
*  the reports of surgical scissors or other things that were deemed to be potentially dangerous. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=433.58s)]
*  Part of this operation, part of the near-term focus needs to be working with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=438.94s)]
*  Egypt to ensure that whatever comes into Gaza at this point is not strengthening Hamas, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=444.3s)]
*  not giving Hamas tools and weapons to be used against the Israelis, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=451.5s)]
*  not allowing them to replenish their strength. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=455.42s)]
*  And there needs to be a process for doing that, but doing it efficiently so we can get humanitarian [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=458.38s)]
*  aid back into Gaza. But there needs to be a real plan, Walter. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=463.1s)]
*  And I think one of the things that Israel's been criticized for is as they've gone into Gaza, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=467.34s)]
*  and certainly as they prepare to go into Rafa specifically, that there hasn't been enough [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=473.1s)]
*  attention for how to ensure that the Palestinians there will be cared for as they have to displace [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=478.46s)]
*  themselves again to get out of harm's way. And making the humanitarian element a key part [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=486.78s)]
*  of the overall operation has got to be part of this. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=493.41999999999996s)]
*  What do you see as an eventual outcome for Gaza? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=496.38s)]
*  Look, I think it's a really difficult question right now because on one hand, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=501.9s)]
*  it needs to be a situation where Israel is secure. Israel's not going to live with a Gaza that is a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  source of insecurity for it going forward. There's no interest in allowing or encouraging the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=514.54s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza to move elsewhere. So there's going to be an enormous rebuilding [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=523.74s)]
*  effort that needs to happen, a security effort that needs to happen. And then making Gaza a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=529.0999999999999s)]
*  livable, sustainable place over time, that's going to require the involvement of not just the United [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=536.14s)]
*  States and Israel, but Saudi Arabia, other Arab nations, Egypt, who can play a role in helping to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=542.94s)]
*  secure Gaza and ensure that it's got the investment necessary to survive. The other big issue, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=551.1800000000001s)]
*  Walter, is who's going to rule Gaza? What's the political situation in Gaza? And the Palestinian [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=557.9000000000001s)]
*  Authority has very little credibility among Palestinians. Amos will not be permitted to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=564.3000000000001s)]
*  govern Gaza by Israel. And there's not been the kind of investment, particularly by the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=569.9s)]
*  Arab, surrounding Arab nations over the years, in supporting and cultivating a strong Palestinian [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  administrative state to be able to take control both of Gaza and the West Bank. And so that is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=582.78s)]
*  the next step. I think that it may take years for that to happen, but there's no time like the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=590.06s)]
*  present to begin to invest in that. You're sitting in the Council on Foreign Relations building. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=595.98s)]
*  As you can tell, wood paneled, wonderful molding. It's been there for a century or so. And on the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=602.38s)]
*  walls of that building, I know, are sort of the great elder statesmen of American foreign policy, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=607.98s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans, who work together in a nonpartisan way. That seems to have broken [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=613.4200000000001s)]
*  down in this country. Tell me, what are the causes of that? And what do you do at the Council now [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=621.1s)]
*  that this nonpartisan consensus no longer exists? I think it's so important. I mean, it used to be, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  there was the phrase, the politics stopped at the water's edge. And when it got into foreign [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=634.62s)]
*  policy, there was a broad consensus around the role of the United States in the world, around [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=639.26s)]
*  the open liberal market-based economies, around democracy. All of that is very much at risk right [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=644.9399999999999s)]
*  now. And I don't think we should overstate it. There are still a lot of Republicans and a lot [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=654.06s)]
*  of Democrats who agree on the fundamental principles of that, of internationalism, of the US [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=658.78s)]
*  playing a constructive role in the world. They may disagree over some of the tactics and how far to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=665.5s)]
*  go, how long to commit. But I think the role of the US as a very critical nation and its leadership [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=670.94s)]
*  being needed on so many issues is recognized by many. Having said that, there's been a long [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=677.5s)]
*  tradition in the United States of isolationism. And we now see it on elements of both parties, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=683.1800000000001s)]
*  but particularly in the Republican Party. The Council was founded over a century ago, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=690.3800000000001s)]
*  precisely to address the risk of isolationism and the understanding that our interests and the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=696.62s)]
*  interests of the American people are so closely tied to what goes on around the world that it's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=702.86s)]
*  important for the US to be engaged and to show leadership. And those very same dynamics are [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=709.02s)]
*  present today. And we're very much active in trying to bring together Republicans and Democrats, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=713.9s)]
*  broader coalitions, to talk about these issues and to talk about how the US should exercise [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=719.74s)]
*  leadership. Is there something we got wrong in that globalism consensus? And there's some [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=724.78s)]
*  rationale to the backlash against it that's happening not only in the United States, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=730.94s)]
*  but around the world. So I think if we look back over the last several decades, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=736.38s)]
*  the opening up of economies, the integration of them has had enormous positive impacts in general. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=743.58s)]
*  It's lifted hundreds of millions, if not billions, out of abject poverty. It's allowed [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=750.46s)]
*  really all the human development indicators to be improved. It has brought nations closer [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=756.78s)]
*  together in a number of respects. I think what was clear, though, is that the benefits of that [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=763.82s)]
*  integration have not been broadly and equally shared. And so that between nations and within [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=770.14s)]
*  nations, there were winners and losers. And the impact on those who were left behind were not [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=775.82s)]
*  fully addressed. Just take the United States as an example. I think this, by the way, cuts across [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=783.2600000000001s)]
*  both Democratic and Republican administrations. We never paired our focus on integrating the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  global economy with sufficient domestic policy to take care of those who would be adversely affected [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=794.5400000000001s)]
*  in the short or the medium term. And we saw the impact of this on communities as factories closed, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=801.58s)]
*  as manufacturing shrunk, and as there were no—there wasn't sufficient social safety net [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=806.7s)]
*  and programs to help people really develop and transition to new industries and those new [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=813.1s)]
*  industries to be invested in their communities to take up the slack. And that, I think, has led to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=818.7800000000001s)]
*  populism and protectionism, some nativism, and nationalism as well. And we see that not [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=825.34s)]
*  just in the United States. We see it in some other countries as well. But we see it particularly in [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=831.9s)]
*  our politics. What do you think the election of Donald Trump would mean for American foreign [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=835.9s)]
*  policy? You know, when I travel around the world, the concerns I hear are about American isolationism [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=842.38s)]
*  and about our political dysfunctionality. Those are the two major risks that the rest of the world [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=851.1s)]
*  sees when they look at the United States. We have a little bit of dysfunctionality right now, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=857.5s)]
*  witness Congress not being able to act on the aid from Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, etc. But I think [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=864.62s)]
*  when the world looks at the choice that we'll face in November, they view President Trump as being [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=873.34s)]
*  more isolationist, and that very much scares them. And so, you know, of course, we don't know [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=879.34s)]
*  exactly what policy President Biden would pursue in the next, in a second term, nor former President [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=885.58s)]
*  Trump, if he were to be re-elected. But I think the broad consensus is it's likely to be more [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=892.22s)]
*  isolationist, less focused on alliances and partnerships. And that will have ramifications [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=898.14s)]
*  more broadly for how our policy is implemented around the world. Can you understand, though, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=905.98s)]
*  the appeal that that has in some parts of America? And to the extent you think it's wrong, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=911.1s)]
*  what can you do to counter it? So I think I do understand the appeal. And as I said, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=918.0600000000001s)]
*  it's not new. Isolationism has been here really since the beginning of the Republic. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=924.3000000000001s)]
*  We would miss George Washington's farewell address about entangling alliances, his warning about [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=929.26s)]
*  that. We certainly saw it earlier in the 20th century between World War I and World War II. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=936.54s)]
*  And I think the 20th century, and President Biden made reference to this at the beginning of the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=943.7399999999999s)]
*  State of the Union, the 20th century holds out some very important lessons for us, which is [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=950.8599999999999s)]
*  by withdrawing from the world doesn't mean that things aren't going to happen outside our borders [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=955.58s)]
*  that affect us. And I think right now, let's just focus on Ukraine. The Ukraine war is very [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=960.94s)]
*  importantly about the Ukrainians and their national aspirations, but it's much bigger and broader than [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=967.34s)]
*  that. It's about whether countries can challenge the fundamental principles of international order [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=971.5s)]
*  and stability, that is the agreement not to use force to change borders. And I think a lot of [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=979.1s)]
*  countries are looking at Ukraine, whether it's China and its concerns about its focus on Taiwan [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=985.5s)]
*  or countries all across other regions of the world who say, well, look, if we can [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=992.22s)]
*  redress our grievances around where borders are drawn, that becomes the new normal. It's going to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=999.66s)]
*  be an outbreak of a lot of conflicts and a lot of wars, and that has an implication for us here at [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1006.3s)]
*  home. The same thing, obviously, on the economic issues. I understand that free trade is not, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1011.9s)]
*  in fashion right now, there's been a big reaction against it. But when people begin to see, okay, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1019.02s)]
*  what does it mean for my, getting the availability of goods at an affordable price, and particularly [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1023.74s)]
*  for people who are spending a disproportionate amount of their disposable income on imports, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1028.54s)]
*  which tends to be people with the lower levels of income, they'll begin to see they don't like [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1034.3s)]
*  inflation, they don't like high cost of living. How do we strike that balance? How do we make sure [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1040.3s)]
*  we're not throwing out the baby with the bathwater when it comes to some of these issues? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1045.18s)]
*  I think we need to do a much better job, by we, I mean, people in government, people in institutions, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1050.78s)]
*  people in education, of just making clear what's at stake. Why does it matter? Why does Ukraine [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1056.3799999999999s)]
*  matter to somebody in the middle of the country? And is it because if we're not supporting [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1062.78s)]
*  Ukrainians, we may find ourselves sending our own soldiers to war in one place or another? Is it [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1068.62s)]
*  because it's going to disrupt the supply of food and other fertilizer and other goods in such a way [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1074.62s)]
*  that it could have an implication back here at home, including at the grocery store? What is it [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1082.3s)]
*  that we, how do we make those issues relevant to people at home? And then making clear, as I said, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1086.7s)]
*  what the tradeoffs are of the different policy options that are available to us. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1092.22s)]
*  Michael Froman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1096.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVGS_GN4YY&t=1099.66s)]
