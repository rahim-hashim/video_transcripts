Video Description: "It was simply impossible to stay silent.” This is the reason given by an editor for Russian state TV for risking everything to speak out against Vladimir Putin’s war. Marina Ovsyannikova has already been fined for being what Putin himself today denounced: Russians with a "Western mindset" acting as “national traitors.” Ovsyannikova's defiance was cheered around the world as an act of bravery, punching a small but important six-second hole in the relentless flood of propaganda being broadcast to the Russian people. In her first major TV interview since the on-air protest, Ovsyannikova tells Christiane that even her own mother believes the Kremlin’s disinformation, and explains how she overcame her fears to act.

# EXCLUSIVE: Russian TV Protester: “It Was Simply Impossible to Stay Silent” | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4)
*  You are an ordinary Russian woman who worked for state television. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=0.0s)]
*  You have two children. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=4.4s)]
*  What on earth made you do this? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=6.08s)]
*  How did you decide to do it? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=9.28s)]
*  You know, I decided to do it spontaneously. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=15.96s)]
*  But the decision was brewing for quite a long time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=22.56s)]
*  You know, lately I have been feeling a cognitive dissonance more and more [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=27.4s)]
*  between my beliefs and what we say on air. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=34.76s)]
*  It was a growing sense of dissatisfaction that kept increasing every year. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  And the war was the point of no return. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=51.2s)]
*  When it was simply impossible to stay silent. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=54.96s)]
*  And I realized that I would either need to do something [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=58.84s)]
*  or we will reach a point of no return. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=64.4s)]
*  And it will be more and more difficult to do anything. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=73.84s)]
*  Marina, tell me physically how you were able to do it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, could you just freely walk onto the set? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=81.08s)]
*  Were you part of the nightly broadcast as a producer? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=84.64s)]
*  How did you actually physically get access to the anchor set? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, let's say that I was afraid until the last minute that I won't be able to do it, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  that it won't have the effect that I was expecting. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=104.72s)]
*  Because the newsroom on Channel One is a huge open space, open plan area. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=109.28s)]
*  And I was planning to stand back, but then I realized that I will not be visible [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=118.36s)]
*  and the directors will change the layout very quickly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  I'll be arrested and it will over at once. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=129.44s)]
*  But eventually I watched the scene technically and thought how to organize it correctly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=133.88000000000002s)]
*  And right in the last minute, I decided that I would be able to overcome the guard [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=143.36s)]
*  who stands in front of the studio and stand behind the host. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=156.48s)]
*  So I moved very quickly and I passed by the security and showed my poster. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=164.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=186.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=189.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=191.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=193.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=195.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=197.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=199.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=201.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=203.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=205.44s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbWF41aEXy4&t=207.44s)]
