Video Description: As the bloodshed in Gaza continues, Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza have killed at least 87 Palestinians in the last 24 hours. The death toll in the enclave now surpasses 44,000, according to the health ministry there. This comes as the U.S. blocked a U.N. draft ceasefire resolution earlier this week, saying it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas. Former war correspondent Arwa Damon is on the ground in Gaza with her charity INARA, providing critically needed food and medicine to children. She joins the show from there.

# On the Ground in Gaza: Inside the Humanitarian Crisis | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo)
*  Joining me for more is former war correspondent Arwa Damon, who is on the ground with her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=0.0s)]
*  charity, Anara, providing critically needed food and medicine to children. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=4.48s)]
*  Arwa, great to see you, great to have you on the ground there. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=9.56s)]
*  And as we noted in the introduction, no real end in sight to this conflict. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=12.84s)]
*  Barack Ravid from Oxeo says that Israel sent a letter to the U.S. administration saying [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=17.16s)]
*  that they have no intention of starving Palestinians or of implementing the controversial so-called [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=22.56s)]
*  General's Plan in the North. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=28.299999999999997s)]
*  Walk us through the humanitarian situation and what you are seeing there in your current [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  visit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  Look, this is my fourth time back in Gaza since this all began. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  And each time I leave, I think that it quite possibly could not get worse than yet it somehow [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=42.54s)]
*  does. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=47.34s)]
*  And the sense really is that Israel from the onset has been saying that its intention is [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=48.34s)]
*  not to collectively punish the population or to starve the population or to kill civilians. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=53.82s)]
*  And yet that is exactly what we see happening on the ground. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=59.74s)]
*  We're in a situation right now where the humanitarian sector in and of itself is on life support. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=63.1s)]
*  And look, we're not going to put our tools down on our own, but we might end up forced [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  into that position quite simply because we're not going to have any tools left. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=72.98s)]
*  We're not going to have anything left to be able to offer the population here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  The UN actually sent a letter to COGAT highlighting that insecurity, the lack of supplies and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=80.42s)]
*  the impact of Israeli strikes on certain locations right after humanitarian missions have carried [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=88.3s)]
*  out activities there or dropped off supplies are severely damaging and is strongly urging [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=94.76s)]
*  Israel to take this very seriously. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=100.7s)]
*  But it's not, no one's really all that optimistic that it's going to make that much of a difference. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=102.3s)]
*  Where do I start to even begin to try to describe this situation? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=108.18s)]
*  If we take even the simplest thing, school books for children, notebooks and pencils, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=111.62s)]
*  you'd think that that would be easily brought into Gaza so that we can provide kids with at [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=117.38s)]
*  least basic supplies in these makeshift tents that they're attending classes in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=122.86s)]
*  But we can't. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=128.66s)]
*  Bringing in a notebook and a pencil is extraordinarily difficult. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=130.02s)]
*  Bringing in tarps or even finding tarps in Gaza to be able to provide extra protection [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  against the rains that we're all expecting to have coming is extraordinarily difficult [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=140.98s)]
*  and very, very hard to find. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  And speaking of the rain, we're expecting flooding to happen when the rains do come. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=147.1s)]
*  And a lot of these makeshift tented areas in these camps that have cropped up are in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  low lying areas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=157.22s)]
*  So they're going to get flooded, only they're not going to just be flooded with rainwater. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=158.94s)]
*  They're going to be flooded with sewage and waste. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=162.74s)]
*  And we've been asking the Israelis and locating different alternative sites that that sewage [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=166.06s)]
*  and waste could potentially be moved to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=172.74s)]
*  But all of those sites get rejected. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  There are water wells in Gaza City that could potentially be brought back online. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  But organizations are unable to do that because the well also happens to feed an area like [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  which Israel has effectively been besieging, a siege within a siege and bombing very, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=188.9s)]
*  very intensely. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=193.94s)]
*  I mean, I could go on and on and list all of the examples of just how Israel is crippling [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=194.94s)]
*  humanitarian operations here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=200.34s)]
*  One of the big concerns, which I'm sure you and a lot of our viewers may have been hearing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  a lot of organizations talking about, is the looting that has been happening. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=206.26000000000002s)]
*  It's very important to point out here that this looting takes place in areas that have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=210.02s)]
*  been under evacuation order that Israel fully controls. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=214.14s)]
*  And we have repeatedly been asking for alternative and safe routes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  Nearly 100 trucks, we should note, carrying food for Palestinians were violently looted [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=224.26s)]
*  just this past weekend after entering Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  It was one of the worst eight losses in 13 months of the war in the enclave. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=231.94s)]
*  Did you witness any of this? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  I would love to hear from you and that you documented so well and in such detail on your [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=240.1s)]
*  Instagram account and on social media just the relationships that you've built with people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  there on the ground, the connections that you've made, what they are telling you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=251.74s)]
*  Can you give us a bit more anecdotally and personally what you've experienced from speaking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=256.94s)]
*  with people? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=263.58s)]
*  There's a lot of frustration. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=265.38s)]
*  There's a lot of anger. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=268.34s)]
*  There's a lot of desperation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=269.65999999999997s)]
*  And you see this in the adults and you also see this in the children. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=271.34s)]
*  Yesterday was World Children's Day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=275.94s)]
*  Thursday was World Children's Day. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=278.9s)]
*  And we had this big event at one of the camps and we had clowns and jugglers and people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=280.9s)]
*  entertaining the kids. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=287.14s)]
*  And it was there that you really began to sort of see the way that some of the trauma [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=288.73999999999995s)]
*  was manifesting itself, especially among the children, because some of them just weren't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=293.9s)]
*  interacting at all. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=298.7s)]
*  And you look at them and it's like, you know, they're there, but their mind is somewhere [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  else. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=304.9s)]
*  Their eyes are blank. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=305.9s)]
*  And no matter how the clowns would try to draw them out, they just couldn't. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  And then you also hear the children's laughter, some of the other ones, and it just sounds [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=313.06s)]
*  like pure magic. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=318.38s)]
*  And this one mother came up to me and she said, you know, my son, he's just he hasn't [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=319.62s)]
*  been the same since two of his siblings were killed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=324.06s)]
*  And he doesn't want to engage because he keeps wanting his two siblings to be there with [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=327.44s)]
*  him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=333.5s)]
*  And he keeps asking me, you know, where are they and why did they have to go? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJh_olU_Mjo&t=334.5s)]
