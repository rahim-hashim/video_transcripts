Video Description: Since the General Manger of leading NBA franchise, the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for Hong Kong protesters, the political fallout has been huge. The NBA swiftly responded that the statement was “regrettable” and that the organization has “great respect for the history and culture of China.” Charles Barkley, a 16 season veteran of the NBA, joins Christiane to give his take on the controversy.

# Charles Barkley Gives His Take on the NBA-China Controversy  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU)
*  He's obviously kind of saying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=0.0s)]
*  what you're saying. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=1.44s)]
*  His original sound when he was [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=2.58s)]
*  asked an actual question, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=5.28s)]
*  he said, look, I'm not going to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=7.44s)]
*  get into a war of words [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=9.44s)]
*  with Daryl Moret, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=11.24s)]
*  but I don't think he was [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  educated enough to understand [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=14.08s)]
*  the ramifications of what he did [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=15.84s)]
*  and how it would hurt [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=18.44s)]
*  so many people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of what [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=21.34s)]
*  you're saying. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=22.88s)]
*  Why do you think he put himself [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  in the middle of this? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, number one, he's the most [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=27.0s)]
*  popular player. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=29.18s)]
*  He's the best player we got. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Listen, I don't think Daryl Moret [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=31.68s)]
*  was wrong. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  I just think you can't insult [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  the entire country when you go [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=37.08s)]
*  on over there making money. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=38.38s)]
*  And that's what the Rockets, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=39.84s)]
*  like I say, the Rockets are [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=41.18s)]
*  probably the most profitable team [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  in China. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=44.02s)]
*  So you can't insult people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=45.34s)]
*  and then try to make money. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=46.94s)]
*  I feel bad for LeBron [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  because, you know, all these [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=50.38s)]
*  people are saying LeBron [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=51.18s)]
*  took the money. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=52.24s)]
*  First of all, I have no problem [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=53.84s)]
*  with a guy looking out for his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=55.34s)]
*  financial interests. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=56.68s)]
*  But in the big picture, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=57.82s)]
*  he's representing the NBA [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  and Nike. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=61.38s)]
*  It ain't just about his money. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  You got the greatest player [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=65.26s)]
*  in the world, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=66.58s)]
*  the most important player [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=67.76s)]
*  in the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=68.92s)]
*  If he goes crazy [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=69.86s)]
*  on China, yeah, he's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  going to lose some money, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=74.32s)]
*  but also the NBA and Nike [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=75.62s)]
*  are going to lose a lot of money. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=78.78s)]
*  And we're talking about tens [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=80.12s)]
*  of billions of dollars. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=81.42s)]
*  So I think it's really unfair [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=83.18s)]
*  that people are trying to say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=85.38s)]
*  LeBron had to do that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=86.58s)]
*  because of not just because [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=88.36s)]
*  of his money, but like I say, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=89.86s)]
*  we're talking billions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=91.38s)]
*  with the NBA [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=92.38s)]
*  and we're talking more and more [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=93.66s)]
*  billions with Nike. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=94.88s)]
*  And he's the number one guy [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  at Nike. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=97.38s)]
*  Interesting, we saw him sort [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=99.32s)]
*  of backpedal a little bit [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=100.66s)]
*  when he faced this backlash [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=102.32s)]
*  because at home, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=104.42s)]
*  people were saying, hang on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=105.48s)]
*  a second, you too are selling out [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=106.38s)]
*  to Beijing's rules. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=108.42s)]
*  And he backtracked a little bit [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=110.28s)]
*  saying that, no, he's not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=111.72s)]
*  arguing with Darrell's substance. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=113.08s)]
*  And Darrell didn't mention China, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=114.72s)]
*  by the way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=115.92s)]
*  He just said, let's support [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=116.38s)]
*  freedom and democracy in Hong [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Kong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=119.06s)]
*  So he backtracked a little bit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=121.56s)]
*  But the good news, of course, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=124.16s)]
*  is that China has now quietly, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=126.16s)]
*  at least we're not making [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=128.68s)]
*  a big deal about it, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=129.66s)]
*  but it's now started playing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=130.48s)]
*  on showing again the Houston [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=133.18s)]
*  Rockets games. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  So it's always a bit of a push [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=136.28s)]
*  and pull with China, isn't it? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=138.66s)]
*  You do something they don't like, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=140.16s)]
*  they wrap you over the knuckles, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=141.42s)]
*  and then business as usual [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=143.32s)]
*  starts up again. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=144.96s)]
*  Well, listen, that was all that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  was always going to be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=148.06s)]
*  the bottom line and literally [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=150.0s)]
*  and figuratively, you know, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=152.4s)]
*  it's easy for everybody to say [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  what LeBron should say [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  and blah, blah, blah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=156.96s)]
*  But we're talking hundreds [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=158.24s)]
*  of millions and billions [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=159.94s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  I can say the NBA, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=162.36s)]
*  we've been in China [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=164.56s)]
*  The entire United States [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=165.74s)]
*  been in China for a long time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=167.06s)]
*  But LeBron was representing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  himself and people can say [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=171.56s)]
*  he's selfish. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=173.4s)]
*  I have no problem with him [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=174.1s)]
*  protecting his own money, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=175.14s)]
*  but also he had to protect [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=176.54s)]
*  the NBA and Nike. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWCA2FznncU&t=178.5s)]
