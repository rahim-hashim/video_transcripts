# NATO Secretary General on Ukraine War: " We Are Now Faced With a New Reality" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY)
*  So this has been quite the exciting day. You've had a huge summit. President Biden has just left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=0.0s)]
*  A lot of activity going on. Is what you decided here, what you were going in hoping for? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=5.28s)]
*  What did you really want to come out with? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=11.92s)]
*  I wanted actually the very strong message that is coming from this summit of unity, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=13.76s)]
*  of support to Ukraine, of the importance of strengthening the defense of the alliance, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=19.44s)]
*  especially the eastern part of the alliance. And then of course that we need to put maximum [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=26.16s)]
*  pressure on Russia to end this census war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=29.6s)]
*  So a lot of people are very concerned and I had an interview with President Putin's spokesman and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=32.88s)]
*  he talked about the nuclear option in certain instances. And we've just said that you have [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=37.28s)]
*  discussed this and President Biden said, you know, the nature of the response by NATO would depend [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  on the nature of the use if there was a use of any kind of prohibited weapons. Can you give us [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  any more insight into where the line in the sand is, what you would do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=54.64s)]
*  First of all, I'm very careful about speculating because we are in a very dangerous situation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  If I start to speculate, it will only add to the uncertainty. What is clear is that any attack on [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=63.84s)]
*  a NATO country would trigger the full response from the whole alliance. That's the core [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=69.44s)]
*  responsibility of NATO is one for all, all for one. That's article five. And to make sure that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=73.6s)]
*  there is no room for misunderstanding or miscalculation in Moscow about that commitment, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=78.8s)]
*  we have significantly increased our presence in the eastern part of the alliance, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=83.68s)]
*  not least with US troops. There are more US troops in Europe now than for many, many years, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=87.76s)]
*  but also European allies are stepping up. So you said that you had to reposture NATO, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  right? Reposition it for the future. And there's, I think there's something like 40,000 NATO troops [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=97.76s)]
*  around right now. What are you looking at for the future with these additional formations that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=103.12s)]
*  you've talked about and where? These 40,000 troops under direct NATO command together with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  100,000 US troops and other troops, they are part of our imminent response to the Russian invasion [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=113.68s)]
*  of Ukraine. But we are now faced with a new reality. This will be with us for a long time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  The consequences of this war is a new normal. And therefore the leaders today tasked the NATO [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=126.48s)]
*  commanders to put forward options for more longer term adaptation, a reset of NATO's deterrence and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=134.32s)]
*  defence. That's about more troops, but also more air capabilities and naval capabilities [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=141.44s)]
*  to make sure that we provide credible deterrence also in the future. And where? What countries? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=146.64s)]
*  Across the alliance, but mainly in the eastern part of the alliance. This is partly about presence, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=151.44s)]
*  but also partly about the ability to reinforce quickly if needed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfGgGKVFIwY&t=156.8s)]
