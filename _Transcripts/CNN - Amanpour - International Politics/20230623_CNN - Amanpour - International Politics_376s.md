# Obama Foundation Leaders: A New Generation Takes on the Fight for Democracy | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs)
*  All right, Mr. President, welcome back and and leaders, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=0.0s)]
*  Hodges, Summer and Binet. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=3.12s)]
*  We were talking just before the break about the pervasive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=5.76s)]
*  misogyny and frankly, physical attacks on women around the world. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=9.28s)]
*  I just want to first start by asking you, Mr. President, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=13.68s)]
*  what is the effect on democracy when essentially half the globe's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=15.72s)]
*  population is kept down and it still is? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=19.56s)]
*  Well, you've answered your own question. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=22.32s)]
*  If you've got half the population that is being suppressed, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=24.88s)]
*  often violently, then by definition, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=28.16s)]
*  democracy is not functioning in the way it should. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=32.72s)]
*  And what is also true is, is that when women are not empowered, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=34.92s)]
*  typically they're the ones who are the caregivers, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=41.2s)]
*  which means children are not empowered. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=44.92s)]
*  And the kinds of issues, whether it's health care or education, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=48.0s)]
*  kitchen table issues, those are not being attacked. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=53.36s)]
*  They're not being intended to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=57.96s)]
*  And so we are depriving ourselves of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=60.24s)]
*  a set of perspectives that are vital to making democracy work. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=66.48s)]
*  And when you look at countries that are successful, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=70.52s)]
*  they are countries in which women are empowered and countries [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=75.0s)]
*  that are less successful, that stagnate, that are more likely to engage [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=78.72s)]
*  in conflict and are more violent are typically ones in which women are suppressed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=82.88s)]
*  And I've read a new report that's just come out in the last several days, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=87.96s)]
*  the UN Gender Index, and it shows that some nine out of ten people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  are biased against women in about 80 countries where they surveyed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  About half say that men make better leaders, political leaders, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  men are better business leaders, and a quarter of the respondents say [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  that they accept men beating their wives. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=109.24s)]
*  I mean, a quarter of the respondents. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=112.24s)]
*  Let me ask you, Hajar, because, you know, you come from Sudan, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  you're living back and forth in Europe, and you've experienced war and refugee status. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=117.92s)]
*  Tell me how it affects you and in your community building, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=125.52s)]
*  this, you know, this oppression of women still. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=128.8s)]
*  Well, stepping into that and going back to how Sudan works, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=131.96s)]
*  especially when it comes to women rights and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=135.04s)]
*  Sudan has been facing this massive wave of having this kind of like explaining [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=138.56s)]
*  to women that they cannot do anything. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=146.0s)]
*  Right. Like we have always been told that you cannot vote. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=148.12s)]
*  Who's going to take your vote? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=152.52s)]
*  You cannot you cannot participate in anything. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=153.8s)]
*  You are not as equal as men are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=156.72s)]
*  So having all of those challenges that are being faced by women, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=159.0s)]
*  it kind of reshaped half of the women in Sudan into not knowing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=162.32s)]
*  what kind of leaders they can actually be. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=168.44s)]
*  So the power that they actually have in them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=170.72s)]
*  And it took us like ages to realize that women are actually strong and they can [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=173.44s)]
*  they can empower and they have the right to vote. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=178.52s)]
*  They have the right to have a voice and they have the right to be respected as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Stepping into respect, it has always been a challenge for Sudanese women to be respected, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=184.96s)]
*  especially when it comes to be respected by men, because for them, it's always like, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=189.0s)]
*  we are the leaders, like we rule the family. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=193.12s)]
*  It's only us, nobody else. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=195.6s)]
*  And for me, especially, I have always been challenged by it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=197.88s)]
*  But luckily, I grew up in a family that always taught me that you have the right [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=202.04s)]
*  to do whatever you want as long as as you know what you're doing and we trust you enough. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=206.92s)]
*  So as my part, I wanted to reflect that in my own way. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=211.72s)]
*  It took me like a lot of time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=216.0s)]
*  I went back to Darfur. We've all heard about Darfur. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=217.56s)]
*  It was the scene of the genocide in the early 2000s. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It was massively and so unfortunate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=222.88s)]
*  I went back to Darfur. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=226.12s)]
*  I sit down with families in refugee camps and try to explain to them [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=227.2s)]
*  the importance of how they should actually like let the girls go to school. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=231.04s)]
*  Right. So I was the enemy when I started talking about that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=234.64s)]
*  They didn't know that I was actually trying to help. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=237.8s)]
*  They were like, no, you're working against culture. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=239.64s)]
*  So here we see how culture is playing a main role in shaping even the community that we are around. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=241.2s)]
*  You know, we have you three women leaders here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=247.56s)]
*  I'm sure the Obama Foundation has some male leaders as well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=249.72s)]
*  But here we are, the three women leaders. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm glad we do, because I want to ask you about what you get from the foundation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=255.28s)]
*  and what the foundation is designed for in terms of, you know, getting getting information from each other, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=259.8s)]
*  sharing experiences, community building. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  Just to add one thing that is really key when it comes to the women right issue, it has to do with representation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=269.0s)]
*  What do we see represented and across the board? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=275.56s)]
*  I think we have an issue of having female leaders that we actually can see ourselves represented in. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=279.6s)]
*  We have a lack of communities and organizations that are led by women. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  We also have an issue of networking, having a space, a safe space where you can connect with other women or men even. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=292.8s)]
*  And one of the things that the Obama Foundation and the Obama leadership has given me as a as a leader is truly the networking, the role models I really needed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=301.72s)]
*  Growing up in Tiensta, it's one of the most vulnerable areas in Sweden. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  And I would sit in a bus, travel from Tiensta all the way to Shista, which is the Silicon Valley of Europe, looking out the window, seeing these amazing companies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=318.32s)]
*  It's a tech hub. It's a tech mecca, basically. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=330.16s)]
*  And sitting in the bus holding in my hand a device. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=333.48s)]
*  So throughout my entire life as a 14 year old or as a 25 year old, I've always been connected with technology in my hand. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=338.36s)]
*  But looking out the window, I made a decision as a young girl, I will never ever get a job in tech. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=348.68s)]
*  And the main reasons is if you don't see yourself represented, what will you become? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR-5f6kSRfs&t=355.28000000000003s)]
