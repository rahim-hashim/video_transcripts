Video Description: Emergency meetings are underway across the Middle East. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Jordan meeting with King Abdullah as the region deals with the sudden fall of the Assad regime in Syria. In Israel, President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sullivan says the U.S. is trying to close a hostage/ceasefire deal. On Wednesday night the United Nations General Assembly demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and also condemned a new law in Israel that will ban the operations of the relief agency UNRWA. The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, is on a tour of capitals that support the agency's work in an effort to get that ban reversed. Lazzarini joins Christiane in London.

# UNRWA Chief Philippe Lazzarini Condemns Israeli Ban of His Organization  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ)
*  Now, last night, the United Nations General Assembly demanded an immediate, unconditional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and also condemned a new law in Israel that will ban [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=5.44s)]
*  the operations of the relief agency UNRWA. The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=11.28s)]
*  on a tour of capitals that support the agency's work, trying to get that ban reversed. And [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=16.92s)]
*  he joined me here in the studio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=22.76s)]
*  Philippe Lazzarini, welcome to the program. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  You are in London as part of your meeting with major donors, the government. Also, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=29.32s)]
*  you're trying to get supporters to get Israel to reverse the ban on your operations. Is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=34.92s)]
*  that right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=39.92s)]
*  That's correct. I mean, the first objective for us is to reverse the ban, to make sure [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=40.92s)]
*  that it is not implemented, because if it is implemented, it would also mean the end [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=46.96s)]
*  of the UNRWA operation in Gaza, but also in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank. And as [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=52.6s)]
*  we know, we have a major humanitarian operation taking place in Gaza. We have to scale up [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=58.32s)]
*  our effort instead of further weakening our collective response to the people in Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=64.32s)]
*  We're hearing just the most awful stories continuously, the starvation, every day the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=73.32s)]
*  killing, and we show the pictures and we show families mourning their many, many kids. You [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=78.88s)]
*  know, Israel says they're going after militants as well, but there's a huge number of civilians [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=85.64s)]
*  and specifically children who are being killed. How, you know, if you're not officially able [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  to enter or operate, I know you have people there, what are they seeing on the ground, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  your workers, your employees? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Stories are absolutely harrowing. I just had our staff counselor who went to Gaza for four [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  weeks, has interviewed, was in relation with 2,000 of our staff, and basically they were [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=109.48s)]
*  sharing their stories. They're heartbreaking. For example, staff member saying that I lost [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=115.92s)]
*  30 kilo, we are hungry, and we are just eating animal fodder to keep us alive. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  Even staff members? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=128.4s)]
*  Even staff member. Even staff member. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=129.58s)]
*  So if that's the case for them, what does that mean for the ordinary Palestinian family, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=131.4s)]
*  children, women? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=135.8s)]
*  That means hunger is a real reality. It is a deepening in Gaza. You know, Christian, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=137.72s)]
*  in September we couldn't reach 1 million people, 1.4 million people in October, 1.7 million [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=144.64s)]
*  people in November. Hunger is deepening. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=150.84s)]
*  So the Secretary of the National Security Advisor has been and is in Jerusalem. They're [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=154.92s)]
*  trying to work on a ceasefire and a hostage deal. He did say a number of things, including [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=159.92s)]
*  a pointed message, I assume, to the Israeli government, that feeding the starving in Gaza [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=165.64s)]
*  does not harm Israel's security. Why do you think that message isn't getting through? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=170.44s)]
*  I think the message is not getting through because there is absolutely no empathy because [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=178.88s)]
*  the war in Gaza is being legitimized under the label of the fight against terrorism. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=185.68s)]
*  So basically the suffering of the people in Gaza cannot really be felt. But I would say [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=193.32s)]
*  the exact opposite would go against the security of Israel. If we keep people being starving [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=199.32s)]
*  in Gaza, it can only deepen resentment and future extremism in the region. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Can we just talk about why you're banned, the elephant in the room? And I'm going to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=212.32s)]
*  get this absolutely right and correct. As you know, Israel, from the beginning, has [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=216.0s)]
*  essentially accused UNRWA of having staff members who not only they say are part and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  tools of Hamas, but some who took part in the October 7th massacre. You know this, you've [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=226.56s)]
*  done investigations, you've laid certain people off. Have you had any actual evidence [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  to support that charge? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  We had an investigation from the Internal Oversight Mechanism of the United Nations. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=241.44s)]
*  The conclusion had been shared at the end of July. Basically, half the staff, there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=247.0s)]
*  was not enough evidence. And for half the staff, the conclusion was, if the information [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=253.0s)]
*  is authenticated, this might contribute to indeed criminal charges. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=257.68s)]
*  Conclusion for the agency has been that all the staff has been dismissed. And I have always [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=264.14s)]
*  been very clear, if any of them have participated to the horrible massacre of October 7th, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=269.0s)]
*  this would be a terrible betrayal to the United Nations, betrayal to the Palestinian [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=274.6s)]
*  communities, and that needs to be criminally investigated. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=280.48s)]
*  But just to be clear for me, did the Israeli authorities present you with evidence that's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=285.72s)]
*  incontrovertible? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=290.48s)]
*  No. We have allegations. Most recently, we received a list of 100 staff members. We keep [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=291.48s)]
*  asking for substantiated information to open investigation, but we have never ever received [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=299.48s)]
*  this information, even to allow the UN to open an investigation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jSj5P27sWQ&t=306.48s)]
