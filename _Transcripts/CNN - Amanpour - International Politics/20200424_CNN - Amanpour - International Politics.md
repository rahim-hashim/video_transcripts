# How Israeli Politics Have Been Affected by Coronavirus  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM)
*  So let's get to the political now, because as I mentioned, Benny Gantz, who's now gone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=0.0s)]
*  into an emergency unity government with Benjamin Netanyahu, and you and your party were part [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=4.64s)]
*  of the coalition to begin with, has basically said, you know, I would never do this, Netanyahu's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=10.8s)]
*  not fit for public office. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=17.48s)]
*  And now he's basically said, we prevented a fourth election, we will safeguard democracy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=19.44s)]
*  What is, what's your reaction to that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=26.32s)]
*  Well, this of course caused the split up of blue and white. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=30.92s)]
*  We were never part of the coalition, we were part of blue and white, and this caused the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=35.0s)]
*  division between us and Benny Gantz's faction. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=41.84s)]
*  The thing is this, we were very close to completing a political move that would have given us [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  the advantage and be the end game, whatever anybody wanted, and definitely the end game [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=52.68s)]
*  that Benny Gantz was apparently looking for was different than, for example, mine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=59.84s)]
*  But we were about to complete this move in the Knesset, and just as it was about to be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=65.08s)]
*  completed in my mind, the way I see it, Benny Gantz just caved in. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=69.32s)]
*  And this is not a unity government, as you said in the beginning, because he's moving [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=73.36s)]
*  15, 17, no more than that, members of Knesset, against a bloc that is close to 60. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=79.16s)]
*  He's not getting any positions that are crucial to the fight against the coronavirus, as he [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=85.56s)]
*  stated was the reason for him to move into government. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  And most important of all, he's guaranteeing, this is not an emergency government, this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=95.32s)]
*  guarantees Netanyahu at least 18 months as prime minister and 18 more months of some [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=100.36s)]
*  kind, I won't get into the details of it, of basically immunity and being able to stand [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=107.52s)]
*  trial on the one hand and still continue to be a replacement prime minister and someone [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=112.64s)]
*  who holds the helm of Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=118.0s)]
*  And that we couldn't agree to, and that's why blue and white split, and we are apparently [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=120.92s)]
*  headed towards the opposition. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=126.4s)]
*  Do you think that the sort of arrangement that's been set out, will Netanyahu handover, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=128.16s)]
*  you know, rotate the prime ministership in 18 months as has been laid out? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=135.4s)]
*  Are you confident that that will happen? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=139.04s)]
*  I'm almost confident that that will not happen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=143.04s)]
*  And this is the opinion, a poll just came out stating that this is the opinion of most [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=146.24s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=150.96s)]
*  They're trying to pass, and I'm just coming here from the Knesset, I'm going back to the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=152.24s)]
*  Knesset, they're trying to pass all kinds of intricate laws, which basically, you know, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=156.04s)]
*  seem to be a change of Israel's constitutional nature, only to create this artificial bond [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=161.56s)]
*  between two people who simply just don't trust each other. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oC2WPwKpM&t=168.96s)]
