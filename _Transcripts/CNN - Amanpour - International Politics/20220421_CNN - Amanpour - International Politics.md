*  identify themselves. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=91.1s)]

*  taken to a police department in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=108.6s)]
*  Moscow, one of the police [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=110.3s)]

*  He was given one phone call. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=118.9s)]
*  He called me and let me [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  know under which article he was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=123.0s)]
*  being charged. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  Charges against him were [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  absolutely ridiculous. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=127.8s)]
*  The official police report said [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=130.1s)]
*  that he had [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=131.8s)]
*  behaved erratically on seeing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=135.6s)]
*  police officers that he had [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=137.5s)]
*  changed the trajectory of his [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=138.9s)]
*  movement, quickened his pace and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=140.3s)]
*  trying to. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=141.8s)]
*  Well, he couldn't have done any [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=143.4s)]
*  of those things because he was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=144.5s)]
*  sitting in his car. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  He was not even on his feet to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  have done any of those things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  But this is an article under [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=152.0s)]
*  which you can be sent to jail [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  right away for up to 15 days, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=155.9s)]
*  which they did. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=157.8s)]
*  They tried him the next day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=159.70000000000002s)]
*  Thankfully, his lawyer was [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=162.8s)]
*  present, but still they tried [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=163.8s)]
*  him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  That court session took only [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  about half an hour to 45 [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=168.4s)]
*  minutes. Everything was sealed [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=169.9s)]
*  and done. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=171.4s)]
*  And he was sent to jail for 15 [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=172.5s)]
*  days. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=174.7s)]
*  On the morning he was arrested, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=175.4s)]
*  or right before he was arrested, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=177.3s)]
*  he was on CNN and he called [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=178.8s)]
*  Putin's government a regime of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=180.8s)]
*  murderers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=183.2s)]
*  Do you think that's the real [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=184.2s)]
*  cause that he got arrested for? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=185.8s)]
*  My husband has been very [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=189.0s)]
*  outspoken, fiercely outspoken [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=191.4s)]
*  against this regime's atrocities, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=195.0s)]

*  years and years to years, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=199.4s)]
*  because with the Russian [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=201.4s)]
*  society, Putin has been [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=203.70000000000002s)]

*  his own people. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=699.4s)]
*  Because we need to continue [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=701.3s)]

*  my husband continued working [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=887.8s)]
*  closely with William Browder to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=889.5s)]
*  push for more sanctions. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=891.5999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, these targeted [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=894.0s)]
*  sanctions, the majority of them [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=896.0s)]
*  came only after the war broke out [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=898.5s)]
*  and it is tragic that it has [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=900.5s)]
*  taken the rest of the world over [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=902.9s)]
*  22 years and a bloody war in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=905.3s)]
*  the middle of Europe to realize [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=907.9s)]
*  what this regime actually brings [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=910.4s)]
*  to the world that they cannot [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=912.4s)]
*  treat Mr. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=913.8s)]
*  Putin as a partner, that they [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=915.2s)]
*  cannot reset relations with him, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=916.6s)]
*  that they have to actually push [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=919.1s)]
*  back and fight him. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=921.1s)]
*  And well, had these targeted [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=923.7s)]
*  sanctions been introduced five, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=927.4s)]
*  seven, maybe ten years ago, this [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=930.4s)]
*  war would never have happened. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=932.4s)]
*  Of this, I'm convinced. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=934.6s)]
*  And now we need more sanctions [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=937.1s)]
*  and these sanctions will be more [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  massive. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=942.4s)]
*  They affect the entire Russian [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=943.0s)]
*  economy. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=945.6999999999999s)]
*  And yes, when Mr. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=946.6999999999999s)]
*  Putin is finally in jail, when [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=947.8s)]
*  he's serving, when he finally [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=950.3s)]
*  stands trial for all the war [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=952.6s)]
*  crimes that he has already [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=954.6s)]
*  committed in Ukraine and that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=957.0s)]
*  he's committing against his own [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=958.7s)]
*  population in Russia, when his [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=960.4s)]
*  clique is finally imprisoned [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=963.7s)]
*  for a very long time, I hope. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=966.6s)]
*  Russia will be left in ruins. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=968.9s)]
*  We cannot forget about that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=971.9s)]
*  Mr. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=973.5s)]
*  Putin is not erasing Ukraine, not [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=973.9s)]
*  just Ukraine from the face of [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=977.4s)]
*  the earth. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=978.9s)]
*  He's also destroying Russia. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=979.5s)]
*  The country will be in ruins and [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=982.5s)]
*  we will have to rebuild everything [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=984.4s)]
*  from scratch. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=986.4s)]
*  And I know that my husband will [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=987.6999999999999s)]
*  be one of those people who will [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=988.9s)]
*  be very much involved in this [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=990.5s)]
*  work of rebuilding. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=992.8s)]
*  We hear reports that people are [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=994.9s)]

*  And they're getting back to the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=1004.5s)]
*  mothers of these soldiers. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0aQb94rqHY&t=1005.6s)]
