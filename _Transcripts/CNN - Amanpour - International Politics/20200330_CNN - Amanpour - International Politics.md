Video Description: Journalist Maria Ressa is CEO of Rappler, a news site in the Philippines, where she fearlessly reports on the brutal realities of President Duterteâ€™s infamous "war on drugs," which has left a trail of bodies in its wake. Now Ressa herself is in the firing line, facing criminal charges from the government. She joins Christiane to talk about her reporting and the importance of a free press.

# The War for Truth in the Philippines  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k)
*  So that's Peter Pomerantsev using Duterte and Rappler's sort of interlink there as an example of what then went wrong. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't think that we did anything differently. We were reporting his campaign as we always have, right? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=8.0s)]
*  He was one of five candidates. We had no political agenda. I think where it came together is that he says things candidates shouldn't say. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=15.0s)]
*  Like in one interview he told me he killed three people. Who says that? And who's running for president, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=24.0s)]
*  And then when he went to this presidential debate, it was maybe a thousand students there, a thousand audiences. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=32.0s)]
*  It was the kickoff to his presidential campaign outside of Mindanao because that was January of 2013. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=39.0s)]
*  Which was his province where he'd been governor. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=46.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=48.0s)]
*  Mayor. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=49.0s)]
*  I think he also realized the power of Rappler because what made us different was unlike the traditional newsgroups, we had the millennials. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=50.0s)]
*  Our main base, because we went on social media, that was our primary distribution. Our age was 18 to 34. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=58.0s)]
*  And then of course when we continued reporting the way we've been reporting, the minute you see an average of eight people getting killed every night, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=66.0s)]
*  that was what our reporter was coming home with. That's off the scale. And we kept doing it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=76.0s)]
*  And so what happened? Because then he turned on you and the community turned on you or appeared to. What happened? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=81.0s)]
*  These are familiar tactics, right? I mean, the first thing was the social media attacks. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=87.0s)]
*  So Mayor Duterte used social media successfully to get elected. At the beginning I was clapping because they actually did that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=92.0s)]
*  But the weaponization of social media happened after he became president, not coincidentally with the start of the drug war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=102.0s)]
*  And they went after not just journalists, and this is very personal, this is a new weapon against journalists, but they also went after anyone who questioned the drug war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=109.0s)]
*  Then after that, they systematically attacked traditional journalists. We weren't first in line, we were third. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=118.0s)]
*  The largest newspaper, the largest television station, we were third in line and I think we just pushed back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=127.0s)]
*  How did you push back? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=135.0s)]
*  We wanted to continue doing the story and it was very clear that the government was fudging numbers. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=136.0s)]
*  The first casualty in the war for truth was the number of people killed in the drug war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=141.0s)]
*  Today the government will say, will admit to killing almost 6,000 people. That number alone is insane. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=145.0s)]
*  But if you compare it to what the Philippine Commission on Human Rights and the UN says, it's more than 27,000 people killed. That's genocide, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAW9jpMB1k&t=151.0s)]
