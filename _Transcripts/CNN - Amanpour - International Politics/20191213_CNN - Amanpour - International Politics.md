Video Description: The dust has settled on the U.K. general election, and it was a decisive win for Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party and his unambiguously pro-Brexit stance. Johnson has a comfortable majority, guaranteeing that Brexit will happen. By contrast, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party suffered a catastrophic defeat, its worst since 1935. Christiane analyzes the situation with a panel of experts.

# Roundtable Analysis of the UK General Election and Brexit  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [December 13, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ)
*  We knew this was going to be a highly unpredictable election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I think that's one, maybe the only thing on which everyone agreed. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=2.64s)]
*  I thought we would have a hung parliament. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=6.28s)]
*  I massively underestimated the level of support for the Conservatives, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=7.96s)]
*  especially in places where people will tell you it's almost in their DNA [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  not to vote Conservative. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  And this feels in some ways like a country that's taken a decisive step, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=18.0s)]
*  but it does also feel as split as ever. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=21.84s)]
*  If you look at the metropolitan centres, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=23.6s)]
*  those were the places that retained their Labour strongholds. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=25.68s)]
*  So the divide between a city like London and the more industrialised North [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=28.04s)]
*  now seems greater than ever. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=32.92s)]
*  So it's really a lot to take in and it feels as if the divisions in our country [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=34.88s)]
*  have, if anything, been solidified by this election result. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=41.0s)]
*  So, Mark Lander, let me ask you, because some people say, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=44.0s)]
*  well, it's very like America. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=47.04s)]
*  The divisions in the country solidified. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=48.6s)]
*  Although you saw Boris Johnson saying, now there must be closure, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=50.44s)]
*  there must be healing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=53.6s)]
*  And he seemed, according to some analysts, to be tacking more moderate, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=55.12s)]
*  tacking more to the centre. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=59.64s)]
*  Do you think that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  And what do you think the US might take away from this? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, I agree with people that say that Boris Johnson is not an insurgent [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  in the same way that Donald Trump was. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=70.12s)]
*  Donald Trump, when he was elected, was every bit as radical [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=71.92s)]
*  as anyone thought he would be in terms of how he governed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=75.08s)]
*  I think in terms of how Boris Johnson will govern, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=77.96s)]
*  from the perspective of domestic policy, government spending, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=81.08s)]
*  I think he probably will try to tack toward the centre. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=84.72s)]
*  He was clearly making an appeal for unity in his remarks today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=87.2s)]
*  I think where things get a little bit tricky is in the issue of Brexit. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=91.8s)]
*  What kind of Brexit does he negotiate? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=95.4s)]
*  His instinct might be to go for a softer Brexit, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=98.56s)]
*  in part because he now has inside his party all of these working-class [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=102.12s)]
*  former Labour voters from the Midlands and the North. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  I think the problem is he's going to find he's a bit hemmed in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=110.16s)]
*  because a softer Brexit implies all kinds of concessions on Britain's part [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=113.64s)]
*  in the negotiations with the European Union. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=118.88s)]
*  I think he might find that difficult to do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  He's also made a series of promises in the course of this campaign [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=123.08s)]
*  about not extending the negotiating period beyond 2020. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=126.8s)]
*  So I think there will be a series of difficult decisions [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=130.6s)]
*  he'll come up against fairly soon. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=133.64s)]
*  Well, and we're going to get that view later in the programme [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  from the former Danish Prime Minister. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=138.48s)]
*  But as to the get Brexit done, Simon Fraser, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=140.4s)]
*  and you were, as I said, head of the British Foreign Office. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  It's not really... I mean, this election is not getting Brexit done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=147.08s)]
*  Yes, the divorce deal. Yes, he has a majority that will force through his deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  But what then, as Mark alluded to, what happens next? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=154.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think you have to say it is a really important moment on Brexit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  It's not getting Brexit done, but it means Brexit is going to get done. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=162.8s)]
*  And that changes the psychology of Brexit. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  And those of us like me who are basically remainers have to accept now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  we're not going to have another referendum one way or another. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=172.72s)]
*  This is going to happen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVO-ulzKiqQ&t=175.28s)]
