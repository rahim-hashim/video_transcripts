Video Description: Tensions between the U.S. and China -- Russia's closest ally -- are intensifying after a visit to Moscow by Beijing’s top diplomat, Wang Yi. The meeting is setting off alarm bells in the West over the possibility of China providing lethal aid to Russia. Professor Jessica Chen Weiss was a senior adviser to the U.S. State Department until July of last year. She tells Walter how Beijing’s latest moves could impact another year of war.

# How to Prevent a Cold War With China  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno)
*  We dig deeper now into Beijing's latest moves. Professor Jessica Chen Weiss was a senior advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=0.0s)]
*  to the State Department until last year, and she's joining Walter Isaacson to talk about this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=6.32s)]
*  Thank you, Christiane and Jessica Chen Weiss. Welcome to the show. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=11.92s)]
*  Thanks so much. It's great to be with you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=16.64s)]
*  China's chief foreign policy minister, Wang Yi, met with Putin this week. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=18.8s)]
*  Wang Yi had just come from the Munich Security Conference, and he said [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=25.28s)]
*  he was working on a peace plan from President Xi of China. What do we know about that peace plan? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=28.56s)]
*  We don't know yet. I mean, we'll have to see, but I'm not really expecting anything dramatic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=35.04s)]
*  to break ground. China has, I think, consistently been playing a really difficult strategic game [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=39.6s)]
*  here, balancing on the one hand wanting to have a close partnership with Russia, which Xi Jinping [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=45.44s)]
*  sees as China's most important partner in resisting perceived U.S. efforts at containment, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=52.4s)]
*  and on the other hand, not wanting relations with the United States and the Europeans to go too far [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=59.6s)]
*  south. And so I think that we'll see here in the coming days further elaboration of the Chinese [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=64.72s)]
*  government's efforts to continue to manage this difficult straddle, if you will. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=71.84s)]
*  But isn't it in China's deep national interest to have this war in Ukraine settled? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=77.6s)]
*  I think on the one hand, you know, the continuation of the war puts China in a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=84.56s)]
*  difficult position, but they also don't see a whole lot of, you know, political upside in pushing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=89.28s)]
*  Putin to end this. And so with the two sides pretty dug in, in fact, perhaps gearing up for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=96.8s)]
*  a further escalation, I think China would like to see this issue, you know, in some ways simmer [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=102.8s)]
*  down, but not necessarily be something that they necessarily feel like they want to be on the front [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=108.08s)]
*  lines of managing. But we'll see. This is a bigger step than they've taken to date and I think, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=114.32s)]
*  you know, reflects the interest, particularly on the European side, to see China play, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=118.88s)]
*  you know, a more active role in trying to mediate, perhaps. You know, but this is, I think, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=123.2s)]
*  the longer perspective, I think, that China's taken here is really with an eye toward, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=129.44s)]
*  you know, balancing against the United States. And so China doesn't want to see Russia defeated, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=134.24s)]
*  you know, but whether or not China can see the two sides de-escalate and whether they have, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  you know, really a lot of diplomatic capital invest here, I think we'll have to see. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he was worried and warned Wang Yi [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=149.12s)]
*  against China sending lethal weapons to the Russians to help in the Ukraine. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=154.8s)]
*  Do you think China will do that? I think this is ultimately guided by [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=160.72s)]
*  the Chinese recognition that to date, Putin probably is a bit dissatisfied with the extent [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=165.36s)]
*  of China's support, which has largely been confined to the diplomatic and areas which, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=170.4s)]
*  you know, haven't been subject to international sanctions. But as, you know, Putin needs to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=176.0s)]
*  replenish, you know, we've seen in the Biden administration has indicated that there have been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=181.04s)]
*  non-lethal forms of assistance, dual-use types of goods that have gone from Chinese entities to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=185.67999999999998s)]
*  Russian entities. And I think the question here, you know, really remains, you know, what is it that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=191.6s)]
*  we ultimately see as driving China's strategic calculus here? You know, I've said- [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=197.68s)]
*  Well, what is driving its strategic calculus? Well, ultimately, I think China's going to have [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=203.12s)]
*  to balance its need to resist the United States against its desire for, you know, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=208.32s)]
*  continued access to international technology markets and capital. You know, that reflects that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  continuing dilemma. And so far, at least, I think there's a question as to whether or not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  the Chinese government sees any strategic upside, again, to limiting its, you know, long-term [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=224.48s)]
*  partnership with Russia. So far, at least, the growing tensions in U.S.-China relations, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=230.88s)]
*  the growing concern that the United States and China are headed for a showdown over Taiwan, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=235.6s)]
*  not necessarily because China wants such a conflict, but because actions by whether it's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=240.16s)]
*  in Taiwan or by the United States are pushing in that direction, I think only consolidates the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=244.72s)]
*  Xi Jinping's belief that it needs a stalwart partner in Russia to resist what the storms to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=250.16s)]
*  come. And so until we see, I think, you know, not just threats, but potential assurances that if [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=255.76s)]
*  China doesn't go forward with this assistance, that there would be some better trajectory ahead [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=263.6s)]
*  in China's relationship with the West. How do we offer that better? We, meaning the United States, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=268.88s)]
*  offer that better trajectory? Well, I think the most important issue is, of course, that of Taiwan. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=274.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think that here it's critical that we deter rather than provoke Beijing on that issue. And I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=280.16s)]
*  think the administration is quite clear that we have, you know, standby our one-China policy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=285.6s)]
*  But I certainly think that there are members of Congress and others who, you know, may be [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=290.32s)]
*  campaigning for election that have gone much further and said that the one-China policy has [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=294.0s)]
*  outlived its utility and that we should recognize Taiwan as an independent state. Those are the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=298.08s)]
*  kinds of statements that I think really, you know, do damage to the long run prospects of peace and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  stability and a non-confrontational relationship with China. And so it's there that if we don't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=307.36s)]
*  make those assurances on, you know, that we aren't supporting Taiwan independence, if we can't make [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  those clear and credible, I think it's going to be hard for us to assure really the world, not just [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=319.6s)]
*  China, that the United States wants, you know, a non-conflictual, productive relationship, even if [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=326.48s)]
*  it's competitive and testy at times with Beijing. Do you think there was a mistake for the Speaker [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=332.8s)]
*  of the House, Nancy Pelosi, to go to Taiwan when she did? You know, I visited Taiwan in December, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=339.12s)]
*  and I think that they recognized that maybe the costs that it brought were [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=344.88s)]
*  greater than the benefits of her visit. And so these kinds of symbolic shows of support for Taiwan, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=348.64s)]
*  however understandable, don't necessarily leave the island and its 23 million residents any better [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  off. And so what I would like to see in our support for Taiwan are meaningful ways, you know, to, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=360.88s)]
*  you know, build resilience, including through, you know, stronger economic ties to the island [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=367.36s)]
*  and find ways to do what needs to be done quietly rather than, you know, waving the red flag. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=373.12s)]
*  Let me read you something that Wang Yi, the Chinese top foreign affairs official, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=378.72s)]
*  said at the Munich Security Conference. He said, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=384.24s)]
*  U.S. bias and ignorance against China has reached ridiculous levels. The U.S. has to stop this kind [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=387.04s)]
*  of absurd nonsense that's done out of domestic political needs. I found that a very strong [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=393.76000000000005s)]
*  statement, but then I also found myself saying, well, there's some truth to it. What do you think? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=400.0s)]
*  You know, oftentimes the cases in which Chinese rhetoric or propaganda kind of hurts the most is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=405.2s)]
*  when it shines a light on the things that we ourselves are, I think, having trouble with, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=411.36s)]
*  which is, you know, developing, you know, despite the administration's best efforts, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=416.32s)]
*  a kind of steady as she goes, you know, here's what we need to do to, you know, get our own house in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=422.56s)]
*  order and lead internationally when you have, you know, a public conversation, which is all about, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=427.92s)]
*  you know, getting as tough as possible. And in often cases, I think, really playing upon and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  exaggerating the threat that China poses. No question, China is a challenge. It's an [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=440.88s)]
*  authoritarian system, very different from ours. But at the end of the day, China's not really [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=445.92s)]
*  going anywhere. There are a lot of ways in which, you know, we continue to, you know, need to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=450.72s)]
*  coexist, you know, on some terms or other. And what's going to be hard for us to meet many of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=456.88000000000005s)]
*  our own objectives, you know, whether that's, you know, meeting our climate objectives without, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=462.48s)]
*  you know, continuing to do business with Chinese entities, many of whom are, you know, innovating [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=468.88000000000005s)]
*  and clean tech. And so I think it's very unfortunate when you have, you know, people like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=474.24s)]
*  Virginia Governor Youngkin, you know, suggesting that, you know, a Ford battery plant that uses [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=478.08s)]
*  or licenses Chinese technology where they're ahead of the United States in that technology, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=484.32s)]
*  saying, well, we don't, you know, that would be, you know, like letting the Chinese Communist [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=488.56s)]
*  Party inside our gates. I mean, that's an that's an own goal. That is not helping us, you know, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  Americans to be kind of this knee-jerk reactiveness. But it's really, you know, I think [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=497.28s)]
*  part of the broader political dynamic that we face here in the United States where, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=504.0s)]
*  you know, taking shots at one another and kind of targeting the Chinese bogeyman seems, you know, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=508.88s)]
*  politically beneficial. Part of this targeting of what you call the Chinese bogeyman, you see it [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=515.84s)]
*  in various states. You've mentioned Glenn Youngkin, but also in places like Texas, where they say [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=522.72s)]
*  the right to buy land by Chinese nationals. Explain what they're doing there and what [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=528.72s)]
*  effect you think that might have. So in many different state legislatures, there are [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=536.56s)]
*  consideration of bans on the foreign ownership by sort of adversary, nationals of a foreign adversary [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=541.76s)]
*  of land or real estate. The security threat here is not particularly crystal clear. You might say [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=548.8s)]
*  that there are certain pieces of land near military sites that you might want to be [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=555.84s)]
*  particularly careful with and have as kind of as mechanism to scrutinize that. But a blanket ban [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=560.4s)]
*  on foreign ownership of real estate is, you know, goes against everything that, you know, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=567.6s)]
*  we stand for. This is a land that was built by immigrants. And frankly, a lot of our competitiveness, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, in high tech areas really depends upon, you know, the kind of immigration and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=578.64s)]
*  assimilation of foreign talent into the United States. And so even if there is a carve out for, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=584.64s)]
*  you know, permanent residents, people who are on the pathway to citizenship, that pathway is very [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=590.56s)]
*  long. And there are first they come over as graduate students and they stay here as postdocs [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=596.0s)]
*  and then, you know, go off into industry. And these folks want to contribute, you know, to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=601.12s)]
*  American scientific and technological leadership. But surveys suggest that 60% of Asian American [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=605.28s)]
*  scientists of Chinese origin, you know, say that they feel unwelcome and are thinking about leaving. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  And so we want to hear in the United States continue to lead in innovating on these technologies. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=619.36s)]
*  We also have to nurture the talent that is going to allow the United States to remain at this [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=624.56s)]
*  frontier. I'd like to try to understand what is the cause of this great and growing conflict [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=630.88s)]
*  we seem to be having with China politically. Obviously, it's an authoritarian state and it [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  goes against many of our values, the Uyghurs and things. But should we take a more realistic [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=643.52s)]
*  approach and say, fine, we're not going to try to interfere in the internal dynamics of China and we [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=649.04s)]
*  just have to look at our own national interests and be competitors with China, but not be in a [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=655.6s)]
*  conflict with China? I think you've put your finger on it, Mother. I think we do need to. And I think [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=661.12s)]
*  the administration has already recognized that our strategy is not premised on trying to change [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=667.04s)]
*  China. That was the narrative for decades. However, I think misplaced that the United States was [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=672.24s)]
*  engaging with China in order to liberalize China. I don't think that was really the story. This was [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  really first of all about standing up the Soviet Union. Then over time, there are a whole variety [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=683.12s)]
*  of interests that we pursued with China. And ultimately, it was better to have them on the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=687.92s)]
*  inside of these institutions than the outside. That remains the case, even though China is no [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  longer liberalizing politically or economically. And so the question is, how do you find a modus [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=696.88s)]
*  vivendi with the second largest economy in the world, one that is armed with nuclear weapons and [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=702.8s)]
*  that is to date, I think, very shown itself under Xi Jinping, quite capable of giving as good as [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=708.72s)]
*  they get. And I think that right now, what we really ought to be looking for is a way to figure [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=716.16s)]
*  out how is it that we, the United States, can be secure? And to what extent does that run through [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=721.12s)]
*  lowering tensions with China, including in this domain, which is what you put your finger on, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=727.12s)]
*  which is this question about mutual interference in each other's affairs? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=732.0s)]
*  Well, let me push back on that a little bit, which is, isn't it a strength of our foreign policy and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=735.76s)]
*  us as a nation that we stand for certain values and we try to promote those values overseas? Or [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=741.44s)]
*  does that cause us an inevitable conflict with China we shouldn't have? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=746.88s)]
*  So I think there are different ways to stand for our values. And I think that already we're seeing, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=751.12s)]
*  I think, at the national level of recognition, we can stand for our values by being an example [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=755.68s)]
*  to the world, which is very different from going around the world, putting our thumb on the ledger [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=760.64s)]
*  and trying to shift the balance of power domestically in our favor. And so I would say here, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=765.52s)]
*  we might want to do a lot more on the side of helping those who are already democratic, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=771.6s)]
*  stay democratic and deepen their democracy and do a little less to exacerbate the insecurities of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=777.04s)]
*  authoritarian leaders around the world. That's not to say that we love autocracy far, but I want to [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=783.12s)]
*  see democracies light continue to shine, but we need to do first the work here at home. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=790.0s)]
*  And then we have to also recognize that we need to prioritize the use of American [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=796.56s)]
*  resources and political capital around the world where it will be most effective and not [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=801.36s)]
*  counterproductive. And so I would say that starting with that kind of core group of democracies [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=805.36s)]
*  would be an important place to start in that effort. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to read you something you wrote in Foreign Affairs called the China Trap. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=815.52s)]
*  And you write of the need to clarify the conditions under which the United States would welcome or [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=819.84s)]
*  accept Chinese initiatives rather than reflexively opposing them. What do you mean about reflexively [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=826.08s)]
*  opposing them? Is that some political problem we have here? And what affirmative vision would you [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=834.48s)]
*  suggest that we propose? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=841.2s)]
*  I fear we're going to continue to be in this reflexive reactive position where the impetus [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=844.24s)]
*  is always if the Chinese government puts forward a new institution like the Asian Infrastructure [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=850.64s)]
*  Investment Bank, or now we have the Global Security Initiative, the instinct is to say China bad [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=856.96s)]
*  without thinking about what is it that we want and to what extent are there overlapping elements [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=862.88s)]
*  of what China is proposing and what we would ultimately desire such that we could say, well, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=868.4s)]
*  here's the pieces of what China is proposing that are OK and here's what's not OK. And if we could [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  work out what that overlap is, that's an area where we could at least agree not to necessarily [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=879.12s)]
*  get in each other's way, even if we are not fully cooperating or collaborating in that endeavor. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=886.8s)]
*  You said that the reflexive criticism of China is part of an echo chamber, almost, that people [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=892.48s)]
*  do not want to appear soft on China in both parties. They don't want to appear soft on China. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=898.88s)]
*  And so they get into this echo chamber. You were in the State Department at the beginning of the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=905.36s)]
*  Biden administration. Isn't it true of the Democrats and the Biden administration that they're a little [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=910.16s)]
*  bit afraid of being seen soft on China? This goes back to this question of is there any [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=915.6s)]
*  political upside domestically of raising inconvenient questions given the broader mood, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=921.84s)]
*  which is one of let's get tough on China. And it's not just the State Department. It's not [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=928.08s)]
*  just the Biden administration. I would say that this dynamic of outhoccing each other is really [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=934.08s)]
*  present on Capitol Hill as well as in think tanks and the broader policy conversation. And [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=939.2800000000001s)]
*  you know, obviously there are people who are genuinely and sincerely committed to their both [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  very dire assessments of what China is doing and the kinds of policies we ought to take in response. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=953.2s)]
*  But I have heard directly from people inside and outside of government that they wouldn't [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=959.2s)]
*  necessarily agree, but they don't want to stick out their neck to question those views and even [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  go further to echo them to want to be as hawkish as the next guy in order to not be attacked [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=970.56s)]
*  politically. And so to me that suggests a real problem in our broader conversation, which makes [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  it hard to think about where are we going? What are the results of the policies that we are adopting? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=984.9599999999999s)]
*  How do we fashion them in ways that deliver for the American people as opposed to just sound tough [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=992.0s)]
*  on China? Because ultimately standing up to China isn't a strategy. It's not a policy. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=998.0s)]
*  And ultimately we are going to have to figure out how are we going to continue to survive in this [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1003.44s)]
*  world and avoid what I fear is a looming crisis or conflict with China in part as a result of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1010.08s)]
*  our inability to prioritize as well as offer these clear choices where if China does this, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1017.68s)]
*  they can expect that. But if they choose a less esplatory option, they could also expect some [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1024.16s)]
*  degree of restraint on our side. And right now the domestic politics of this all point in one [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1029.8400000000001s)]
*  direction, which gives me little confidence or comfort that we are even interested in figuring [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1035.0400000000002s)]
*  out some kind of modus vivendi. Jessica Chinweiss, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW4RAftIKno&t=1042.3200000000002s)]
