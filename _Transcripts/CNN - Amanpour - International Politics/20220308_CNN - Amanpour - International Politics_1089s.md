Video Description: Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman joins Michel Martin today to discuss the current conflict in his homeland of Ukraine and his latest piece in Foreign Affairs Magazine, "America Must Do More to Help Ukraine Fight Russia." Vindman proposes a lend-lease program modeled on the one that provided arms and assistance to U.S. allies in Europe during WWII. He also discusses how Trump and the GOP empowered Putin, and what it is like to be sounding the alarm to no avail.

# Alexander Vindman The U.S. Is at Great Risk of Ending Up in This War  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU)
*  And while the West has rushed to arm Ukraine, there are still holes in the country's defense capabilities. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=0.0s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was the European Affairs Director for the National Security Council in the Trump administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=6.0s)]
*  He was also a key witness in the former president's impeachment trial. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=14.0s)]
*  And he's joining Michelle Martin to discuss the conflict in his native homeland and how to bolster Ukraine's defense. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=18.0s)]
*  Thanks, Christian. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, thank you so much for joining us once again. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=26.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Michelle. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=30.0s)]
*  And your latest piece in foreign affairs, you make the case that while Ukraine has certainly fought valiantly against the Russians, they are going to run out of fuel, ammunition, weapons, aircraft, et cetera. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=32.0s)]
*  You propose that the U.S. and its allies should implement a lend-lease program modeled on when they provided arms and assistance to U.S. allies in Europe during World War II. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=44.0s)]
*  The administration has been very focused on sanctions, which you can understand a long-term accountability piece of that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=54.0s)]
*  But it's hard to see what the immediate benefit is to Ukraine fighting in the trenches as they're seeing people being slaughtered. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=61.0s)]
*  So what I'm asking you, based on your expertise, both militarily and sort of politically, what are some steps that you've taken? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=69.0s)]
*  First of all, on the sanctions, which is we already made some headway there, there is more headroom for additional sanctions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=77.0s)]
*  Some of these, we have to realize that some of these are kind of, they're important, but they're feel-good sanctions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=83.0s)]
*  There might be a pocketbook cost to the American public, but we have to remember that we're trying to avoid a war and we're trying to warn off Russian escalation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=88.0s)]
*  And there are things we could do to soften that blow. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=95.0s)]
*  We could subsidize some of the oil and gas prices for our public and for the European public to get us there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=99.0s)]
*  So that's one of the critical things we can do. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=105.0s)]
*  This Lend-Lease idea is based off of something we did in World War II to support the precursor to Russia, the Soviet Union, who is fighting an existential war against the Nazis. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=108.0s)]
*  Now we need to do the same thing for Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=118.0s)]
*  And that's actually one of the striking things. There's a messaging component to it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=121.0s)]
*  We're supporting Ukraine against the fascist Russia that's looking to destroy this large sovereign independent state, democratic state that's striving to join the international democratic union. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=125.0s)]
*  And the things we needed to do was we need to establish depots. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=139.0s)]
*  And these are basically forward positions of logistics to on-demand serve Ukraine's interests. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=143.0s)]
*  It's too late for us to wait for a Ukrainian request for supplies and then ship it in and then figure out how to distribute it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=150.0s)]
*  We need it right there. So as soon as the Ukrainians want it, they collect it, they move it into the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=159.0s)]
*  That's basic things like water, fuel, food, medical supplies for the enormous civilian casualties right there on the spot. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=165.0s)]
*  It's also military supplies, ammunition, bullets, again, fuel for military vehicles. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=174.0s)]
*  It's more javelins, these anti-tank systems. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=180.0s)]
*  It's more stingers, but it's also more capable systems that really get at the heart of Russia's advantages. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=183.0s)]
*  And the most important thing is air power. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=189.0s)]
*  Russia has a massive advantage in terms of air power and long range fires. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=192.0s)]
*  These are the ballistic missiles that have been raining fire down on Ukrainian cities from many, many kilometers away, hundreds of kilometers away, in fact. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=196.0s)]
*  And what we could do is we could arm the Ukrainians with these legacy planes from Eastern Europe. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=204.0s)]
*  We're overthinking that one. We're now bogged down on how do you get them across the border? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=210.0s)]
*  You put Ukrainian pilots in and you have them fly across the border. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=216.0s)]
*  That is not going to trigger a third world war that we're putting, we're giving planes and letting the Ukrainians fly across the border. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=219.0s)]
*  What is the key difference here between what the United States is doing now is that we're actually supplying the hardware, even if we're not operating it ourselves? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=225.0s)]
*  So that's this. There's a couple of things. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=233.0s)]
*  First of all, we're providing right now we've provided thousands of tactical systems that have tactical effects. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=236.0s)]
*  We need operational systems that have operational effects. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=243.0s)]
*  These are the things that are going to really undermine Russia's ability to fight this war and to execute a campaign that's going to really punish cities, destroy cities, kill thousands of people. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=246.0s)]
*  That's where we're on the cusp of right now. The Russians are building up forces to conduct these massive assaults. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=258.0s)]
*  That's why we've seen what amounts to a bit of a slowdown in the last 24, 36 hours. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=263.0s)]
*  They're they're they're collecting strength to launch these massive attacks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=269.0s)]
*  So getting these these capabilities in place now could have a meaningful effect on the battlefield. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=273.0s)]
*  It could strike Russian planes on the airfields in next Crimea in Belarus on the Russian side of the border in the airfields adjacent to the Russian side of the border. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=279.0s)]
*  Helicopters, ballistic missiles. Those are the things that we need to help the Ukrainians target. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=289.0s)]
*  And we need to remember right now we still have we're in this mental block that somehow we could return to business as usual. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=293.0s)]
*  Somehow we could you know there's a scenario where we end this this conflict and it stays limited. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=302.0s)]
*  But that's not the trajectory we're headed toward. We're headed towards the trajectory of protracted war that gets increasingly nasty and draws us further in. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=308.0s)]
*  The decisions that we think are tough today are going to be easier in the future. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=317.0s)]
*  We're going to have much, much more difficult decisions to make in the future. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=320.0s)]
*  We just need to look ahead a little bit and not think about just short term risks, but medium and long term risks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=323.0s)]
*  How this develops in a very, very violent way that drags us in. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=328.0s)]
*  And if we make that switch, then it's easy to provide these capabilities, these systems to the Ukrainians and they could man them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=332.0s)]
*  What is your sense of why the administration and other allies are hesitant? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=338.0s)]
*  As you as you said, the big debate has been over the United States and the allies and NATO enforcing a no fly zone of Ukraine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=342.0s)]
*  There seems to be no political will on either side of the aisle for that in the United States, at least certainly not in NATO. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=351.0s)]
*  But you're saying that's not necessary. The Ukrainians could do this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=357.0s)]
*  So why do you think? What's your read of the situation here? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=360.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not even sure where to begin because there are so many different features here. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=365.0s)]
*  But one of them is this defeatist attitude that somehow based on these assumptions, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=369.0s)]
*  looking at tables on a chart and how much force that Russia had to bear, bring to bear and what the Ukrainians had that this would end quickly. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=375.0s)]
*  And in this kind of mentality, you're looking to minimize risks because the outcome is inevitable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=383.0s)]
*  So why put resources in and why risk a larger confrontation with Russia if it's inevitable? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=390.0s)]
*  We're still not off that, frankly. There's still a defeatist attitude because people that in a lot of cases, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=398.0s)]
*  there just really aren't that many specialists that focus on Russia, that look beyond the tables, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=404.0s)]
*  that understand the asymmetries in morale, that the fact that the Russians, that the Ukrainians will not roll over, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=409.0s)]
*  that the Russians don't have sufficient combat power. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=417.0s)]
*  There's also a great deal of wishful thinking in the White House below the level of the president that this stays limited, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=420.0s)]
*  that there's a way to let this play out between the largest country in the world and the largest country in Europe and nobody else gets involved. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=433.0s)]
*  That is an absurd assumption because already there's enormous pressure growing on Eastern Europe. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=441.0s)]
*  They're bearing the brunt of this with regards to refugees flows. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=447.0s)]
*  They're the ones that are most forward leaning. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=450.0s)]
*  Certainly the Baltics, the Poles, the Romanians recognize that this doesn't end with Ukraine and they want to do more. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=452.0s)]
*  We're the ones that are holding them back. We're the ones that actually arrested, from what I hear, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=459.0s)]
*  the transfer of these aircraft in the moments that it was conceived because we thought it was too risky and now we're pushing it, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=464.0s)]
*  but we lost the momentum, frankly. We lost the momentum. There was an opportunity to do this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=471.0s)]
*  And it's because we're risk averse. We still think there's a chance that this goes back to business as usual. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=476.0s)]
*  In fact, in a Cold War, we're headed towards a heart war. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=482.0s)]
*  And these folks, these people that I've gotten to know, don't get it. They simply don't get it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=486.0s)]
*  They're focused on things that matter under almost every other circumstance like upcoming elections and fuel prices. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=493.0s)]
*  And what that means instead of understanding that we're in a fight for the future of the 21st century [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=501.0s)]
*  and that we're either going to face an enormously emboldened and more powerful adversary, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=506.0s)]
*  even though it might be isolated economically in the form of Russia and the authoritarian world, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=512.0s)]
*  or authoritarianism, the authoritarian world that we've been concerned about that's surging forward is on its heels. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=517.0s)]
*  I've got to say this is the most forward-leaning I've been in, frankly, in terms of criticism, but we're at a tipping point. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=526.0s)]
*  So it's important to make these points. It's a very insular administration. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=531.0s)]
*  These are folks that have been close to President Biden, Vice President Biden for years. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=536.0s)]
*  And they want to insulate them against the shocks of mismanagement like Afghanistan, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=541.0s)]
*  where these people actually were the ones responsible for accelerating plans that didn't really make sense [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=549.0s)]
*  or executing a withdrawal that should have been more thoroughly planned. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=556.0s)]
*  And they're still there. And sometimes you need to be able to tell the boss that he's not wearing any clothes, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=560.0s)]
*  that his assumptions are invalid, that in fact the risks of escalation are minimal. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=568.0s)]
*  And he doesn't have people that could do that right now. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=573.0s)]
*  He has people that are going to cater to his wishes and are not going to push back at minimum. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=575.0s)]
*  There needs to be a little bit more reflection about the missteps we've had over this year with regards to the execution of Afghanistan, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=585.0s)]
*  not the policy decision to leave, but the way it was executed and shepherded by the National Security Council. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=593.0s)]
*  And then again, now with this major war unfolding, they're underperforming. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=599.0s)]
*  And I'd like to see more. This is not a sharp criticism against President Biden, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=605.0s)]
*  because President Biden, frankly, in fact, is a product of 20 years of Ukraine and Russia policy, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=610.0s)]
*  where we have been looking at this relationship through a soda straw. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=616.0s)]
*  We've biased our activities towards Russia, thinking that we could do more than we can, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=619.0s)]
*  instead of places like Ukraine where we have willing partnerships. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=624.0s)]
*  And I also wanted to ask, though, what impact you think the four years of the former president's posture toward Russia, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=628.0s)]
*  what impact that's having now? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=638.0s)]
*  He's no longer in office, but some of the people who are espousing that view still are. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=640.0s)]
*  I'm wondering what influence that perspective has on the president's ability to coalesce around a more aggressive strategy. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=645.0s)]
*  This is a critical point. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=655.0s)]
*  Frankly, the logic now that most of the American public just didn't have the context to understand [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=657.0s)]
*  is the importance of arming and supporting Ukraine and the president's corruption and abuse of power in the first impeachment, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=664.0s)]
*  how that's directly connected to today. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=672.0s)]
*  There is now, you know, it's not a leap anymore. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=674.0s)]
*  It's the fact that the president undermined that relationship. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=676.0s)]
*  That's clear. But there's a deeper point here. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=679.0s)]
*  I was saying that we were headed towards this confrontation with Russia sooner or later. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=682.0s)]
*  Based on Russia's provocative actions, they were eventually going to cross the red line. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=687.0s)]
*  So if we were creeping from Bush, George W. Bush through President Obama, through we were creeping forward towards that confrontation. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=690.0s)]
*  We lurched forward during the Trump administration because in that administration we had a couple of foundational shifts. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=699.0s)]
*  One of them was the catering to Russia, the efforts to really kind of elevate Putin as a world leader, as a credible actor, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=707.0s)]
*  as a as as kind of one of the guys, as a as a as somebody that should be welcomed into the community of nations. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=724.0s)]
*  That's what President Trump did. Trump created some opportunities. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=734.0s)]
*  He basically indicated that there's a softening of the Republican position. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=739.0s)]
*  The Republicans have been traditionally hawkish around values issues and around authoritarianism and things of that nature. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=746.0s)]
*  So there was a softening there. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=752.0s)]
*  There was a fracture between us and our allies or NATO allies. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=754.0s)]
*  Another opportunity and the enormous discord that Trump sowed inside the United States was extremely meaningful. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=758.0s)]
*  We're superpower. And we looked weak because of Trump and not just when he was in office, but even after he left, we have to remember that the insurrection started on January 6th. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=765.0s)]
*  The buildup for this war started just days later. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=776.0s)]
*  The timing is telling that Vladimir Putin saw deep opportunities based on President Trump's insurrection. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=780.0s)]
*  The fact that we were hyper polarized, the fact that Trump has captured the Republican Party and the belief that somehow the Republicans were no longer going to be opponents to Putin's aggression and belligerence. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=788.0s)]
*  And that didn't just end when Trump left office. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=803.0s)]
*  He continued that through to literally hours before this war started. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=806.0s)]
*  So he was elevating and appealing and appeasing Trump in the hours before this war. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=811.0s)]
*  What message does that send to Putin? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=820.0s)]
*  It sends a very simple message that the Republicans will not be part of the response to Russia. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=822.0s)]
*  They will not be part of the cost and position to Russia. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=828.0s)]
*  Just as President Biden is trying to signal that there would be a cost. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=831.0s)]
*  So the rhetoric from the president is sanctions will be fierce, heavy. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=835.0s)]
*  And on the other side, you have Trump saying, we're your friends. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=840.0s)]
*  Don't worry about us. Tucker Carlson saying this. Mike Pompeo saying this. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=844.0s)]
*  You know, Ron Johnson. These folks are actually undermining the deterrence efforts of the U.S. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=848.0s)]
*  government to try to avoid the war. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=854.0s)]
*  So that's why I say that they have blood on their hands because we could have potentially avoided this, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=856.0s)]
*  but they undermined our efforts to avoid this. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=860.0s)]
*  And now we have this major war that threatens U.S. national security, whether we see it or not. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=862.0s)]
*  It's right on the horizon. And they dug a hole. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=867.0s)]
*  They're going to have to lay in that hole. The Republican Party. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=871.0s)]
*  They're trying to distance themselves, but it's too little too late. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=873.0s)]
*  Before we let you go, Lieutenant Colonel Berman, I can't help but think about what this moment is like for you [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=877.0s)]
*  as the person who tried to warn the country about the dangers that were looming, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=882.0s)]
*  about the dangers of the region, the lack of support for the Ukrainian president and his efforts in the Democratic movement within Ukraine. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=889.0s)]
*  And of course, Trump's appeasement. You tried to warn the country about this. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=899.0s)]
*  Certainly, this is not a moment that you take any pleasure in being right. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=903.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, but what's this what's this like for you? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=907.0s)]
*  It's tough, frankly. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=912.0s)]
*  You know, I definitely saw the the peril on the horizon and try to do the best I can to to warn the administration internally, the American public, you know, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=916.0s)]
*  I definitely put myself and my family at risk and we just kept stumbling forward. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=931.0s)]
*  And that happened, you know, while I was in government and that continued to happen even while I was as a I'm still I still consider myself a public servant in the months preceding this. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=937.0s)]
*  I was you know, I put my my credibility and my legitimacy on the line being so assertive about the fact that this is all but certain to happen. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=948.0s)]
*  And we need to do something to avoid it. And we failed. We didn't do that. We didn't do enough. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=960.0s)]
*  I mean, now I'm trying I'm yelling and screaming about the fact that we are on the cusp of a hot war. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=965.0s)]
*  We need to do more to avoid this. The longer this goes, the riskier it gets. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=972.0s)]
*  The decisions that we have to make weeks and months from now are going to be much, much more dangerous. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=977.0s)]
*  We need to make some courageous, risk-informed decisions now to avoid that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=982.0s)]
*  Otherwise, we will find ourselves in an untenable position. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=986.0s)]
*  We need to do that now. We need to provide the Ukrainians the support they need. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=990.0s)]
*  It is going to get worse. I cannot be more adamant about it. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=995.0s)]
*  My desire to see this administration succeed in light of the risks of reversals in the upcoming elections, I'm setting those aside. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=999.0s)]
*  Because right now we have much more imperative. We have an imperative. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1010.0s)]
*  We have a war that we can be dragged into. We need to do everything we can to help the Ukrainians to win this or to freeze this, to move this to a diplomatic solution quickly. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1014.0s)]
*  Otherwise, we have every risk of ending up in this war. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1026.0s)]
*  That is where we are all in peril. It is not the same rattling now. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1030.0s)]
*  It is the creeping, the incremental ratcheting up of tensions that brings us in. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1036.0s)]
*  That is what brings us to risk. I am done being restrained about not that I tend to be pretty plain spoken, but I am done with that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1042.0s)]
*  This is the time to act. I will deal with the consequences of burning the bridges with the only side of the aisle that I have credibility or affinity from. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1052.0s)]
*  That is where we are and that is what we need to do. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1065.0s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, I am Sandra Vindman. Thank you so much for speaking with us today. I do hope we will talk again. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1068.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1073.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySQX9HLnYwU&t=1082.0s)]
