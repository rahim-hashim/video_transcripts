Video Description: Putin's war on Ukraine is entering week four. What is the Russian president's thinking, and what is his endgame? If anyone would know, it would be Dmitry Peskov. He has served as Putin’s chief spokesperson for more than two decades. He was at the president’s side during his rise to power. As a close confidante of Putin's, Peskov is also a high-profile target for Western sanctions. He joins the program from Moscow for an exclusive interview.

*  To Europe to the United States for a couple of decades, but no one would listen to us and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=24.36s)]
*  Before it is too late [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  It was a decision to start to launch a special appearance operation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=33.76s)]
*  Military operation to get rid of entire Russia that was created next to our borders [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=40.12s)]
*  What to get rid of Russia and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=47.32s)]
*  Anti-russia because Ukraine actually Ukraine started to be it was formed by the Western countries anti-russia [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Okay, this is the problem. Okay. You look Ukraine is a country sovereign. It's recognized by the United Nations [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  It's been around for a very very long time, but I just want to know I want to ask you again is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=65.88s)]
*  President Putin because again the Finnish president said to me that when he asked Putin directly [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=73.08000000000001s)]
*  About this because president Putin has laid that card on the table [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=79.84s)]
*  President Putin said that if anybody tries to stop him very bad things will happen and I want to know whether you are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=83.8s)]
*  Convinced or confident that your boss will not use that option [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=90.56s)]
*  Well, we have a concept of domestic security and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=97.12s)]
*  Well, it's public you can read all the reasons for nuclear [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=103.28s)]
*  Arms to be used [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  So if it is an [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=111.72s)]
*  Existential threat a threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=114.36s)]
*  Well, there are no other reasons [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=122.56s)]
*  That were mentioned in that text [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  So you are basically saying only an existential threat to your country [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=127.76s)]
*  I still don't know that I've got a full answer from you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=132.2s)]
*  And I just I'm just going to assume that President Putin wants to scare the world and keep the world on tender hooks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bBgcmnZEQ&t=135.88s)]
