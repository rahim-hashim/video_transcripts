Video Description: Christiane Amanpour is in Ukraine, where -- days away from the second anniversary of the war -- there is a sense of urgency and of frustration. With American support drying up just as Ukraine needs it most, Russia has delivered a significant defeat and its flag is now flying over Avdiivka in the east. Still Ukraine battles on, with inadequate weaponry and its troops exhausted from two years of war. Amid this gloom, the death of preeminent Putin critic Alexey Navalny hit Europe, and Ukraine, like a bolt of lightning. President Joe Biden says Congress's "...failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten." Christiane spoke with President Zelensky onstage at the Munich Security Conference.

**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU)
*  Mr. President, you said that with the will and with all the gear, you could win. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=0.0s)]
*  I've been speaking to American generals, others who said you can win, but it depends on the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=4.9s)]
*  will of politicians in your allied nations, in the United States and everywhere else. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=9.84s)]
*  As you know, there is a stalling in the United States Congress. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=15.76s)]
*  The Republican-led House will not address the huge weapons bill that the President is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=18.8s)]
*  trying to get to you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=24.92s)]
*  Some of them may be here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=26.2s)]
*  What would you say to your Republican colleagues in the United States? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=27.4s)]
*  Anybody who's blocking that bill? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=32.56s)]
*  I will have a meeting with senators today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=34.68s)]
*  I think we will have a speech with detail. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=38.6s)]
*  They have to understand what's going on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=45.0s)]
*  I don't want to push such message to the United States because they did a lot for us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Did a lot. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=53.16s)]

*  Just, yes, we have to work in one, in one joint team. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=62.76s)]
*  That is the answer. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=77.0s)]
*  If Ukraine will be alone, you have to understand what will be. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=78.36s)]

*  And they have to understand that we will win – with them or not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=140.16s)]
*  We don't have any other way. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=146.32s)]
*  We have only one land, our Ukraine. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=148.0s)]
*  Mr. President, you are outmanned, and you always say this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=154.72s)]
*  There are a huge, huge advantage in terms of numbers of Russian forces. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=168.08s)]
*  There is a question of potentially you signing a law or changing the draft and the conscription [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  and lowering the age from 27 to 25. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  Are you going to do that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=182.78s)]
*  It's a comprehensive and complicated question. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=185.74s)]
*  It's a question about how fair recruitment should be. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  The most important issue is rotation of the people who are very tired at the front line, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=195.22s)]
*  physically. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  Any person, not only Ukraine, it doesn't really matter what nation you belong to. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  If you are tired, you have to go back, you have to be restored and somebody else would [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=206.34s)]
*  replace you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=211.62s)]
*  Another professional soldier who has been trained during a certain period of time and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=212.62s)]
*  mobilization recruitment depends on that also. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  How many people you have on the front, how many reserves you have and why you need that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  for defending operations? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=224.98s)]
*  Some number of brigades. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=226.7s)]
*  They began to translate me. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=230.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's difficult. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=232.26s)]
*  For counter-offensive, you need another number of brigades. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  The question of mobilization is a complicated thing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=241.14s)]
*  I can't share with you the number of victims and casualties. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=248.66s)]
*  For example, when we speak that they have too much people, you have to know, for example, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=257.74s)]
*  in Avdiivka, I'm just comparing the number one to seven. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=267.38s)]
*  It's a pity that I'm... [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=274.54s)]
*  But for one death of Ukrainians, seven deaths of Russians. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=277.62s)]
*  One to seven. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=286.22s)]
*  So I'm not comparing this war and I don't want and it's tragedy even to lose one person, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  but we didn't begin it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  But you have to know, you have to understand what was going on in this small city. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc9vxNoWFWU&t=297.02000000000004s)]
