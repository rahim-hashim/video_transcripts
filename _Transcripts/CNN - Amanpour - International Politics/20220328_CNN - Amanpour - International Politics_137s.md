**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0)
*  Talk to me about Mariupol. I mean, it's just devastated. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=0.0s)]
*  And the mayor there today said, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  we are in the hands of the occupiers today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Do you know what he actually meant? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=7.28s)]
*  Is Mariupol still standing? Do you still control it? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=9.0s)]
*  What did he mean by that? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=12.48s)]
*  Well, some part of Mariupol [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=14.52s)]
*  is really under the control of Russian armed forces. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=16.36s)]
*  And you well know that even they started to forcefully deport [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  people to Russia or to the Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=23.88s)]
*  Forcefully they are doing this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=29.04s)]
*  More than 15,000 citizens of Mariupol are forcefully being [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=30.4s)]
*  taken to the Russian parts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=37.68s)]
*  It's maybe from the left bank of Mariupol. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=39.44s)]
*  While the other parts are still [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=41.84s)]
*  fighting for by Ukrainian armed forces. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=44.56s)]
*  But if you ask me about humanitarian situations, really disasters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=46.92s)]
*  You know, it is the case for already more than two weeks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  And not so many people have managed to evacuate, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=53.72s)]
*  especially using the official corridors, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=56.2s)]
*  which practically started to function only the last several days [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=57.96s)]
*  before that people had to go by foot on their own [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=62.44s)]
*  and were picked up on the roads by our rescue teams [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=65.44s)]
*  somewhere close to some other cities. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=69.44s)]
*  So this is absolutely a disaster. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  And you know that every hour practically the city is bombarded. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=74.48s)]
*  The civilian objects are bombarded. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=78.6s)]
*  There's awful things with a drama theater, the maternity hospital. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=80.48s)]
*  They are starting to strike from the sea, et cetera. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=84.64s)]
*  So, yes, we need the efforts of the international community [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  with the evacuation and with, you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=90.96s)]
*  just in order the city not to be wiped out from the ground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=94.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, they practically using the tactics [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  which was using a lapel, you know, it's like reminding the situation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=101.96s)]
*  But yes, you heard my president yesterday. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  He told that people are the most important [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=109.08s)]
*  target for them, unfortunately, Ukrainian civilians, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=112.0s)]
*  and we will fight for our people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  So we are thankful to the initiative of some European leaders [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=116.0s)]
*  that will be helping to evacuate the city. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeFur9qaPc0&t=119.11999999999999s)]
