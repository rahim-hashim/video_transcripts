# Browder on Putin When You Believe Your Time Is Almost Up, You Start a War  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM)
*  Now, unprecedented sanctions have sent the Russian ruble tumbling. The United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=0.0s)]
*  has cut Russia's central bank off from its $630 billion so-called sanctions-proof war [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=5.78s)]
*  chest. Dubbed Putin's number one enemy, Bill Browder is the CEO of Hermitage Capital and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=12.14s)]
*  the architect behind the Magnitsky Act, which President Biden has used to sanction Vladimir [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=18.72s)]
*  Putin and his oligarch cronies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=23.54s)]
*  Bill Browder sat down with Walter Isaacson to discuss the effect of cutting him off from [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=26.22s)]
*  his own wealth. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=30.72s)]
*  Thank you, Kushan and Bill Browder. Welcome to the show. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=31.72s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=36.32s)]
*  You were the largest at one point financial investor, foreign financial investor in Russia. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=37.78s)]
*  What will these sanctions mean to the Russian economy and what things can we expect? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=44.7s)]
*  Well, there's a whole range of sanctions from sanctioning the central bank to a number of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=50.98s)]
*  state enterprises right up to the oligarchs. So in terms of what affects Putin the most, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=57.22s)]
*  it's not necessarily the ones that do the most damage to the economy. What affects Putin [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  the most is the ones that does damage to the oligarchs, these multi-billionaire individuals [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=69.5s)]
*  that we see on the Forbes list and the ones sailing around in their yachts. And the reason [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=75.78s)]
*  that Putin cares about that most is because they hold his money for him. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=79.56s)]
*  And so if we're trying to make a direct statement to Vladimir Putin and go after his own [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  personal interests, that's the one that really stings him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=89.28s)]
*  Can we seize their yachts or their apartments where you are in London? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. And now after after what Putin has done with Ukraine, that that is the plan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=97.0s)]
*  I'm actually calling in from the British Parliament right now where I've spent the morning [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=104.92s)]
*  discussing specifics on how to go about doing that. And there's now an appetite to do that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  for the first time in 20 years. The British are going to seize oligarch assets, and I think the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=118.04s)]
*  Europeans will and the Americans will. And this is a total game changer when it comes to affecting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's calculations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=131.24s)]
*  Well, you're coming to us from right in the heart of the parliament. Tell me what you've [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=133.4s)]
*  done this morning, who you've met with and what ideas you're pushing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=137.8s)]
*  Well, so the most important one is that the list of oligarchs needs to be long and it needs to be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=142.52s)]
*  coordinated. So, for example, there are oligarchs who have already been sanctioned by the United [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=149.72s)]
*  States even four years ago that aren't on the British sanctions list. That makes no sense. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Second, the list of oligarchs by all the countries is still fairly short. There's a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=159.24s)]
*  number of people who are supporters of the regime, who are trustees of Putin's money, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=163.88s)]
*  who are enormously wealthy, who we can go after, and those names need to be added to the list. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=169.32s)]
*  And then the last thing which I've been discussing, and this is really important, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=175.16s)]
*  is that the governments can't go after the assets if they don't know where they are. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=178.84s)]
*  And there's a lot of people working in the city of London and working in banks in New York and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=184.12s)]
*  other places that have been involved in hiding the assets for the oligarchs. And so there should be [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=189.16s)]
*  amendments to the sanctions law, which requires all of the Western enablers to come forward with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=194.2s)]
*  information about the Russian oligarchs who they're looking after. And that should be put [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=201.48s)]
*  into the law. There should be penalties, including prison, for those people if they don't come forward [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=206.12s)]
*  with that information to the government. The central bank of Russia has stopped trading on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=210.92s)]
*  the ruble today, but it seems like it's now down to being worth about one U.S. penny. What effect [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=216.2s)]
*  will that have? Is that something good and we should keep pushing? Well, you know, it's one of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=223.88s)]
*  these things where we wouldn't have had to do that if we had been tougher leading up to the invasion. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  We could have stopped this invasion by all working together, all going after, on a narrow [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  basis, Putin's interests. But we're now in a situation where Vladimir Putin has declared [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  major war in Europe and everything has to be thrown at him, everything. And we have sanctioned [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  SWIFT, in other words, unplugged a number of Russian financial institutions from the main [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=254.27999999999997s)]
*  information connecting network. But we've only done it for 70% of Russian banks. And so what's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=259.56s)]
*  going to happen very quickly is that the Russians will modify all of their payments to go through [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=269.0s)]
*  the other 30% of the banks. And so that needs to be fixed. That needs to be upgraded so all [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=273.16s)]
*  Russian financial institutions can no longer transfer money in and out of the country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=278.36s)]
*  I mean, it's painful for the average Russian. Vladimir Putin is not eating less well because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=282.6s)]
*  of that. Explain to me why we've cut off 70% of Russian banks from the international banking system [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=288.12s)]
*  and its messaging system. But we've left 30% there. Was there a reason? And why don't we just say [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=294.6s)]
*  100%? Well, I'd like to be able to explain it to you, but I can't because I wasn't in these [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=300.6s)]
*  smoke-filled back rooms where dirty deals were being done and people were making compromises on [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=307.72s)]
*  behalf of interests that we don't know about. But I can guarantee you that there were people out there [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  from different countries saying, this will affect my economic interests. Don't do it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=317.32s)]
*  And in doing so, they're effectively trading their economic interests for the national security of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=321.08s)]
*  the world, national security of Europe, the United States, and the UK. What should we be doing with [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=326.36s)]
*  Gazprom, the Russian energy company that's mainly state-owned? Well, basically, for every European [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=330.44s)]
*  household that's heating their house with Russian gas, we're paying money to the Russians for their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=338.76s)]
*  war machine to invade neighboring countries. And so we shouldn't be doing that. And unfortunately, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=345.48s)]
*  it's not something that you can just change overnight. This should have been dealt with a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=352.52000000000004s)]
*  long time ago. It perplexes me why Germany has become more dependent on Russian gas over the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=357.48s)]
*  last 10 years than less dependent. Russia has been using gas as a weapon for a long time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  And certainly, gas is the main way in which they fund their illegitimate activities. And so going [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=368.6s)]
*  forward, I think that there needs to be a major rethink of how Europe gets their gas, and they need [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=374.52s)]
*  to find ways, including ways of having to pay more so that they're not dependent and not funding Russia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=381.64s)]
*  Does that mean we should be exporting and producing more gas and oil? And that sort of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  goes against the climate plans of President Biden. But should we temporarily open our strategic [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=395.08s)]
*  reserves, allow more production of oil and gas, ask the Saudis to do the same? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=400.92s)]
*  Well, I think we're in an emergency situation. I fully support all the initiatives to reduce [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  carbon emissions. But at the same time, if Vladimir Putin starts a nuclear war, we're not going to be [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=415.32s)]
*  around on the planet to enjoy a cleaner environment. And so we have to make some compromises, at least [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=419.24s)]
*  in the short term. And that would require building LNG terminals in Europe. That would require U.S. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=424.04s)]
*  assisting Europe in becoming less dependent on Russian gas. It would require Qatar and Saudi [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=430.92s)]
*  Arabia and other countries who aren't causing these problems to cooperate as well. There needs [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=435.8s)]
*  to be a major rethink. And Germany just announced that in the last couple of days that they're going [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=441.16s)]
*  to do that. It's an extremely important part of not funding Vladimir Putin and not being dependent [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=447.0s)]
*  on Vladimir Putin. You just offhandedly said if Russia starts a nuclear war, is that just a figure [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=453.24s)]
*  of speech? Or do you worry that him bringing the troops up to a new nuclear alert means that this [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=459.8s)]
*  could possibly escalate to being a nuclear attack by the Russians? Well, sadly and scarily, I know [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=466.12s)]
*  Vladimir Putin very well. I've been involved in a conflict with him, a very heated conflict over [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  the last decade. What I've learned about Vladimir Putin is that he never backs down, he can never [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=480.6s)]
*  show weakness, he always escalates. And he's not interested in the national interest of Russia, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  he's only interested in staying in power. And he'll pretty much do anything if he can stay in power. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=491.88s)]
*  And so I don't think anything is off the table with Vladimir Putin, as we saw in the last 24 hours, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=497.08s)]
*  when he all of a sudden, because of financial sanctions, he's now ratcheting up and using [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=501.08s)]
*  nuclear jargon. Your decade-long dispute with Vladimir Putin involved when you were the largest [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=506.84s)]
*  foreign investor in Russia, trying to expose corruption. And you did, you showed the corruption [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=514.92s)]
*  both of Putin and the oligarchs. And that meant that not only did you have to leave the country, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=520.8399999999999s)]
*  but your lawyer was tortured and killed. What did you learn about the corruption? And what did you [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=526.76s)]
*  learn about Vladimir Putin? So we were exposing corruption in Gazprom and other companies that I [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  was invested in. I was expelled and declared a threat to national security for exposing [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=542.44s)]
*  corruption in state companies, which they should have been happy to try to get rid of that corruption. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=547.72s)]
*  After I was expelled, my lawyer, Sergey Magnitsky, discovered a major $230 million government [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=553.96s)]
*  corruption scheme. He reported it, testified against the officials involved. In retaliation, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=560.7600000000001s)]
*  he was arrested, tortured for 358 days in Russian custody, and killed 12 years ago. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=566.2s)]
*  He should have been declared a hero for exposing the corruption. Instead, Vladimir Putin put him [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=577.08s)]
*  on trial three years after killing him and convicted him in the first-ever posthumous trial in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=582.36s)]
*  the history of Russia, the first time that Russia ever has convicted a dead man. And what it shows [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=589.48s)]
*  is that Vladimir Putin is a criminal. He's a guy who is interested in protecting the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=594.04s)]
*  ill-gotten gains of himself and the people around him. He will kill to protect those ill-gotten gains. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=599.9599999999999s)]
*  And everything about his narrative that he's a patriot and that he's looking after the interests [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=606.92s)]
*  of Russia are exposed as being false and a lie, just based on the story of me and my lawyer, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  Sergey Magnitsky. So tell me about the root causes of what he has just done. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=618.68s)]
*  By invading Ukraine, to what extent is it that he wants to keep NATO off of his border, as he said? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=624.04s)]
*  To what extent does he just hate liberal Western style democracies flourishing? And to what extent [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=630.8399999999999s)]
*  is it simply to protect his place in power and the money that he's stolen? Well, from my detailed [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=637.8s)]
*  knowledge of this man, it's all about him staying in power. So Vladimir Putin has been there for 22 [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=646.8399999999999s)]
*  years. In his 22 years, he's stolen an enormous amount of money, I would guess $200 million, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  maybe more at this point. He's stolen that money by killing people, taking people hostage, doing all [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  sorts of terrible things. And that money should have gone to paying for roads, hospitals, and other [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=665.88s)]
*  public services. So after 20 years, people are tired of him. And he sees the writing on the wall. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=673.0s)]
*  In Belarus, 18 months ago, the people rose up against Lukashenko and wanted to replace him after [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=679.4799999999999s)]
*  a fraudulent election. And it was only because Putin sent troops in that they ended up getting [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=687.4s)]
*  that Lukashenko was still in power. In Kazakhstan, just at the beginning of this year, there was a [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=692.76s)]
*  major effective coup where they got rid of the Nazarbayev family. And so Putin saw this and he [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  thought, this is coming for me. This is going to happen to me if I don't do something dramatic. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=706.76s)]
*  And so what do you do if you're a dictator, you need to stay in power in order to stay alive, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=712.28s)]
*  and you believe your time is almost up? You start a war. You deflect whatever anger people [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=717.88s)]
*  might have towards you, towards a foreign enemy. And so I don't believe any of the rhetoric that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=723.88s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has said about NATO, about the Ukrainians, about the Nazis. It's all made up [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=729.32s)]
*  for the purpose of justifying a war, and he needs the war to stay in power. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=740.44s)]
*  To what extent do you think he's vulnerable? What is it that could topple him? The oligarchs [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=745.16s)]
*  rising up in the streets or nothing? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=753.16s)]
*  Well, I think that his biggest vulnerability is that he's stolen all this money over the last [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=756.76s)]
*  20 years. He keeps the money with oligarchs in the West, and that's his Achilles heel because [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  we have access to freeze that money. And I've been screaming from the rooftops for the last month [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  that we should go after the oligarch's money because that's what Putin cares about, is his [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=773.4s)]
*  money. And he values money more than human life. And it's very interesting because the moment we [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=776.92s)]
*  started talking seriously about going after oligarchs, he's threatening nuclear war. Not [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  that he's actually going to follow through on that today, but it shows you how much he values that, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=787.0s)]
*  how upset he is by that. And that's our one bit of leverage. I don't think that at this point, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=792.04s)]
*  freezing those assets is going to stop him in Ukraine. But what I do think is that all of a [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=796.52s)]
*  sudden, the calculus changes. On one hand, he has the reward of staying in power. On the other hand, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=801.24s)]
*  all his money is effectively inaccessible. And we're now in the game of trying to make it as [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=806.6s)]
*  costly as possible for him to do these terrible things that he's doing. And we should absolutely [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=813.08s)]
*  go after the thing that he values most, which is his money, and by doing that, going after the [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=818.52s)]
*  oligarchs. But hasn't Putin already factored sanctions into his plans? There's no way that he [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=822.92s)]
*  can factor the sanctions of his own money in the oligarchs because they're so fully entrenched, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=829.56s)]
*  they're so fully invested in the West. Now, you have to understand as an oligarch, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=834.68s)]
*  looking after Putin's money and looking after their own money, they don't want to keep that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=838.8399999999999s)]
*  money in China or Saudi Arabia or Nigeria. They want to keep it in a rule of law country. They [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=842.04s)]
*  want to keep it in New York, in London, in the south of France. And so, sure, there probably [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=847.16s)]
*  have been some preventative measures that they've taken, knowing that sanctions are coming down the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  road. But I could point out 15 houses in London that are worth a lot of money that they can't move, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=859.0s)]
*  that are owned by Russian oligarchs that could be frozen today. So you're in Parliament right now [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=865.4s)]
*  discussing possible things. Have you pointed out the homes in London that the oligarchs own? And [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=870.6s)]
*  is there something that the British government could do? I have. But more importantly, I have [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=876.92s)]
*  asked them, there's a piece of legislation coming through called the Economic Crimes Bill, which is [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=882.6s)]
*  happening imminently. And I told the government and members of Parliament that there needs to be a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=887.08s)]
*  provision in the Economic Crimes Bill that also includes the Western enablers of the oligarchs, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=892.68s)]
*  all of the bankers, accountants, lawyers, trustees, so that they are required to come forward with [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=899.08s)]
*  information on where the oligarch's assets are. Because some of these things are obvious and some [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=907.08s)]
*  of them are hidden. And all this stuff should be available to the government so that those assets [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=911.32s)]
*  can be frozen and seized. Today, the United States announced it was cutting off Russia's [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=915.48s)]
*  central bank. What impact does that have? Well, it has a very dramatic impact. If you cut off [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=921.0s)]
*  the central bank, then effectively they have no access to whatever dollars they have on their [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=926.2s)]
*  reserves. And the European Union has done the same thing. And what this means is that even though [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=930.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has accumulated $640 billion of central bank reserves, that money is effectively [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=936.84s)]
*  inaccessible. So they can't use it to fund their war effort and they can't use it to support the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=943.48s)]
*  ruble as it goes into a freefall as a result of the swift sanctions. And so it's a very powerful [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=947.64s)]
*  tool, very blunt instrument, but a very required tool based on the fact that what Putin has done [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=953.16s)]
*  by invading Ukraine. And in response, the Russian central bank has raised its basic interest rate [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=958.92s)]
*  from about 9.5% to 20%. What does that do to the oligarchs? What does that do to the average [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=966.12s)]
*  Russians? And for that matter, to people trying to take the money and flee the country? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=972.84s)]
*  Well, when a government raises interest rates like that, what they're trying to do is prevent [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=977.56s)]
*  people from converting their currency to a foreign currency by saying it's more attractive to keep [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=982.04s)]
*  your money in rubles. I don't think it's going to work. I don't think that there's any exchange [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=986.68s)]
*  rate at which people want to keep their money in rubles. They just want to get out as quickly as [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=991.96s)]
*  they can. And so in addition to raising the rates, they've also limited the amount of foreign currency [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=995.48s)]
*  you can buy with your rubles, effectively putting in place pretty harsh exchange controls. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1001.32s)]
*  And they do that because they're running out of money. Even though they have all this money in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1006.9200000000001s)]
*  the bank, they can't access it. And so these are tough measures that have been imposed, for sure. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1010.7600000000001s)]
*  They will have a big effect on the average Russian. And I guess the logic behind it is that [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1019.08s)]
*  a lot of average Russians don't want a war in the first place. And they particularly don't want a [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1024.2s)]
*  war when it's costing them so much personally. And although Russia is not a democracy, Putin can't [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1028.12s)]
*  help but see that people are pretty angry about this situation. Bill Browder, thank you so much [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1034.04s)]
*  for joining us. Thank you. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7XBQG5TzM&t=1040.6799999999998s)]
