# Analyst Israeli Strike Targeting Hezbollah Leader Could Trigger All-Out War  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A)
*  Fawaz Gorgas is a professor of political science at the London School of Economics and joins [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=0.0s)]
*  us now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=5.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us during this breaking news that we have been covering. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=6.2s)]
*  A senior Israeli security official tells me that the goal is clear. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=10.88s)]
*  We want 60,000 Israelis to go home and not just go home, but be safe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  My question to you, given the escalation that we have now seen over the course of the last [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=20.16s)]
*  several weeks and obviously today the targeted assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, do you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  think Israel has come closer to accomplishing that goal? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  Far from it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=35.6s)]
*  The Americans, the British, the French, the international community has made it very clear [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=37.04s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu and his government that if they are serious about returning the 65,000 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=43.32s)]
*  people to their homes, the only way out is a diplomatic solution. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=50.8s)]
*  What Israel has chosen is all-out war. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=56.4s)]
*  Just to really say a few words about the massive escalation in the past one hour, regardless [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=59.84s)]
*  of whether Hassan Nasrallah is killed or not, my reading, and I hope I am wrong, this is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=67.28s)]
*  the tipping point. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  This is the spark that will most likely trigger all-out war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=74.5s)]
*  You'll see in the next day or so, this is it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=77.84s)]
*  Hezbollah will retaliate strategically. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=81.64s)]
*  And that's exactly what Benjamin Netanyahu has been gunning for. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  He wants really a justification to really go to launch a ground invasion. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=88.52s)]
*  And a ground invasion will be really a long war, a much longer war than the war in Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=94.24s)]
*  It will likely last for a decade. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=99.92s)]
*  It will come to haunt the Israeli army in the same way that Afghanistan and Iraq haunted [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=102.76s)]
*  the American army for 20 years, even though there is no comparison between America as [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=109.36s)]
*  the most powerful nation and Israel as a middle power. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=115.48s)]
*  And the last war, we should remind viewers, between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 lasted [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=119.56s)]
*  for 34 days, and neither side truly being able to claim victory in that war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=125.0s)]
*  I'm just curious, in the early days following October 7 and October 8 was when Hezbollah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=131.32s)]
*  began launching missiles into Israel, there were some in the Israeli security establishment, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=138.52s)]
*  including their defense minister, who were arguing and pushing for the opening of a second [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=144.4s)]
*  front to go into, before even going into Gaza actually, going into southern Lebanon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=150.04s)]
*  The U.S. said they wanted no part of that and strongly urged Israel not to do that, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=156.6s)]
*  and Prime Minister Netanyahu did as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  What do you think has shifted at this point, if you do believe he now does want to go on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  for a full-on war? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=168.6s)]
*  Well, what has shifted is that because he really has not achieved his total victory [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=169.6s)]
*  in Gaza, there is basically a stalemate in Gaza. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=174.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the same thing in the United Nations today. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=179.2s)]
*  He wants total victory. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=183.0s)]
*  He wants Hamas to surrender. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=184.72s)]
*  What really means is that he is saying no to the American and the Qataris and the Egyptian [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=186.6s)]
*  hostage deal proposals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=192.6s)]
*  And really by going to the northern front, I think he is diverting attention from Gaza. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=194.36s)]
*  What Benjamin Netanyahu does not really want is a hostage deal with Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=199.38s)]
*  He wants Hamas to surrender. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=203.36s)]
*  He wants total victory over Hamas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=205.12s)]
*  But here is the problem for Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=207.08s)]
*  Lebanon is not Gaza. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah is not Hamas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=213.96s)]
*  Hezbollah is 10 times, if not 100 times, more powerful than Hamas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=216.12s)]
*  And if and when Israel launches its war, you're going to have tens of thousands of skilled [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=222.56s)]
*  fighters migrating to Lebanon from Syria, from Iraq, and from Iran, even if Iran does [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=228.16s)]
*  not really join the fray. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=234.72s)]
*  This will be a long war. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Logically and rationally, one would have expected Israeli leaders to have learned the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=238.8s)]
*  lessons, the lessons of history of 1982 and 2006. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=244.24s)]
*  But obviously, irrationality is as important as rationality in world politics. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  And truly, I'm not exaggerating, Benjamin Netanyahu is aiming for a forever war. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=254.08s)]
*  Israel, and I'm not exaggerating, Israel will never, will never have peace and security [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=260.2s)]
*  if it aims for a ground invasion of Lebanon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  It can destroy Lebanon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=269.72s)]
*  It will destroy the infrastructure in Lebanon. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=271.36s)]
*  But this war can never be won militarily. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  As the Americans, as the Americans have impressed on Netanyahu and the Israeli government for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=277.56s)]
*  the past 10 months, but they have failed to use leverage in order to really nudge Netanyahu [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  to accept a hostage deal in Gaza and now a ceasefire in Lebanon. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1rEwweQ3A&t=288.72s)]
