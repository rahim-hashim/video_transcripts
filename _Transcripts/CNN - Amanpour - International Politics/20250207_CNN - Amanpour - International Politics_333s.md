Video Description: This has been the week American foreign policy was flipped on its head — parts of it shut down entirely. At midnight tonight, USAID puts almost all of its staff on administrative leave, with only a few critical employees remaining at their post. Elon Musk says the agency, whose functioning is crucial to the survival of millions of people around the world, is being fed "into the wood chipper." This action would transform the traditional role of the U.S. on the global stage. Matthew Bartlett was appointed to the State Department by President Trump during his first term. Bartlett joins the show from D.C.

# Fmr. Trump Appointee: Closing USAID Is "More Than Dangerous, It Is Deadly" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo)
*  A lot of people, I guess certainly around the world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=0.0s)]
*  have been, you know, really made very, very uncomfortable [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=3.44s)]
*  and nervous about USAID. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=7.16s)]
*  America is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  And as you know, it's always been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=13.64s)]
*  called by the US a vital tool of soft power. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  How does closing it down to all intents and purposes [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=19.8s)]
*  affect the United States, first of all? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=24.04s)]
*  I guess the short answer is it is unclear, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  but we are about to find out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=30.48s)]
*  Listen, I am a Republican. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=32.2s)]
*  I am a conservative. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=33.68s)]
*  There are arguably some questions, legitimate questions, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=35.4s)]
*  about the activity of USAID. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=39.68s)]
*  Over the past four years, you've seen maybe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=42.28s)]
*  some political activism under the Biden years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  You would be naive not to recognize that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=47.8s)]
*  You would be equally, if not even more naive, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  to not recognize the everyday miracle [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=52.84s)]
*  that USAID and its staff performed around the world [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  in terms of clean water, sanitation, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=59.44s)]
*  and certainly one of the most central tenants [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  of American foreign policy over the past 20 years, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  HIV AIDS treatment and prevention. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=66.96s)]
*  So this is a very, very unsettling notion. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=69.6s)]
*  We've seen efforts of reform. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=73.6s)]
*  Scrutiny is welcomed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=76.0s)]
*  Continuity is critical. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=78.08s)]
*  But the notion of closing and extinguishing USAID [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  is more than dangerous. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  It is deadly. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=86.0s)]
*  I'm gonna get into some of that, those crucial elements [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=87.52s)]
*  of what it actually does for people around the world [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=90.4s)]
*  and also for the US. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=92.84s)]
*  But I wanna first play this sort of mashup of soundbites [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=94.8s)]
*  about USAID and about essentially taking it to the woodshipper, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=98.32s)]
*  as Elon Musk says. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=102.92s)]
*  Here's the president, here's the secretary of state, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=103.92s)]
*  and here's Elon Musk. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=106.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=107.2s)]
*  It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=108.2s)]
*  and we're getting them out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=111.36s)]
*  USAID, run by radical lunatics and we're getting them out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=113.04s)]
*  They just think they're a global entity [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=118.6s)]
*  and that their master is the globe [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=120.08s)]
*  and not the United States. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=121.84s)]
*  As we dug into USAID, it became apparent [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=123.2s)]
*  that what we have here is not an apple with a worm in it, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=126.04s)]
*  but we have actually just a ball of worms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=129.76s)]
*  I mean, Matthew Bartlett, from what I think you said before, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=132.68s)]
*  is yes, there needs to be some accountability and reform, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=135.28s)]
*  but not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=138.2s)]
*  So just describe, do you agree, A, with that characterization [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=140.84s)]
*  of run by a bunch of radical lunatics, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=145.84s)]
*  that it is an apple full of worms? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, let's just be clear. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Again, I was a Trump appointee at the State Department [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=153.36s)]
*  at PEPFAR in the first administration. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=156.44s)]
*  We made different choices [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  than the Biden-Harris administration made. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=160.84s)]
*  Yes, they were run by very progressive individuals, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  ideologies for the past four years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=166.72000000000003s)]
*  That is how, in part, how administrations change, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=168.92s)]
*  and this is why, when you now come in, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=173.2s)]
*  a reasonable governing adult would be in charge, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=175.56s)]
*  would make reforms, would make government and USAID work, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=179.04s)]
*  not end it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=182.64s)]
*  So again, this is more than a political prism. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=183.88s)]
*  This is more than reform. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=188.28s)]
*  This is highly problematic in terms of the outcomes [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=190.04s)]
*  that are desirable for the United States of America. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=193.16s)]
*  If you are saying that USAID was problematic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=196.0s)]
*  in the Biden-Harris years, it is equally, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=199.16s)]
*  if not even more problematic, to then just end it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  So can I ask you, because you've raised PEPFAR [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=205.52s)]
*  a couple of times, and I know that you did a lot of work [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=207.36s)]
*  on that, as you mentioned in the first Trump term. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=209.68s)]
*  We know that PEPFAR was launched by President George W. Bush. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=211.68s)]
*  It's to provide lifesaving care [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=216.16s)]
*  for AIDS patients around the world, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=218.68s)]
*  and it has saved, according to the figures, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  some 25 million lives around the world. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=223.56s)]
*  Just tell me what'll happen, and we're already hearing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=227.72s)]
*  from South Africa and elsewhere, that people are being [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  turned away from USAID-provided care in this regard. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=232.12s)]
*  What will happen? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  What is the end result of cutting this off? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=237.44s)]
*  Krishnan, that is one of the most key central questions [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=240.56s)]
*  going on in this town and around the world right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=243.56s)]
*  Let's just take a step back here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=246.84s)]
*  I reauthorized PEPFAR, or helped reauthorize PEPFAR [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  at the State Department, through a Republican House, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=252.44s)]
*  through a Republican Senate, and signed it to law [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=254.8s)]
*  by President Trump in 2018. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=256.96s)]
*  The world is a better place because of that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=258.96s)]
*  We went from 18 million lives to 23 million lives saved [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=261.76s)]
*  while President Trump oversaw PEPFAR. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=266.76s)]
*  He actually called for an end of HIV AIDS [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=270.92s)]
*  in America and beyond. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=273.4s)]
*  So these are all wonderful things. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=275.16s)]
*  Secretary Rubio has been a long-time champion of PEPFAR, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=276.76s)]
*  of the world's poorest people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=281.68s)]
*  Now, flash forward, when the foreign assistance pause [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=283.32s)]
*  was immediately put into place, it took a few days [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=287.92s)]
*  to have Secretary Rubio issue a waiver for PEPFAR [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=291.64s)]
*  to ensure that critical life-saving program [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=295.44s)]
*  will continue on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=298.32s)]
*  But it's a little more complicated than that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=299.88s)]
*  because PEPFAR is implemented by CDC and USAID on the ground. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  When they are frozen, when monies are frozen, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=307.8s)]
*  drugs cannot get out, prevention cannot take place, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=310.56s)]
*  and again, this throws the entire program into peril. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=315.2s)]
*  ["The Daily Show"] [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euz-wXNEvwo&t=318.64s)]
