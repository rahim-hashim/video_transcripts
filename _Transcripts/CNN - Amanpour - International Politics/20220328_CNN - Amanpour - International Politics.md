# Fiona Hill on a “Neutral Ukraine,” Nuclear Threat and Russia’s Doomed Economy  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk)
*  Now, President Biden's off-the-cuff comments in Warsaw over the weekend were not a call [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=0.0s)]
*  for Russian regime change, says the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=5.2s)]
*  Fiona Hill is a former national security official specializing in European and Russian affairs, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=8.24s)]
*  and she was an impeachment witness against Donald Trump in 2019. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=13.92s)]
*  She spoke with Walter Isaacson about the impact of Biden's remarks and how Putin is likely [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=17.92s)]
*  to react. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=22.72s)]
*  Thank you, Christiane, and Dr. Fiona Hill, welcome to the show. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=23.72s)]
*  Thanks, Walter, thank you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=28.68s)]
*  Biden, in his powerful speech this weekend, ended with what seemed like a bit of an ad-libbed [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  line but one that seemed to have a kernel of truth to it, which is, good lord, this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=36.68s)]
*  guy cannot remain in power. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=41.8s)]
*  Do you think that was a mistake for him to say it, or was that a morally clarifying statement [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  that will guide us? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=49.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, to be honest, obviously, what he said there was what's on an awful lot of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=50.72s)]
*  people's minds. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=55.92s)]
*  It's a question that people keep asking. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=56.96s)]
*  From the perspective of trying to deal with this conflict right now and trying to get [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=59.6s)]
*  Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin to pull back and halt the hostilities, I think it was actually [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=63.08s)]
*  a pretty risky thing to say, because Vladimir Putin obviously is pretty paranoid that the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=68.56s)]
*  United States is out to get him. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=73.8s)]
*  He's been convinced for years, in fact, that we've had him in our crosshairs, that we've [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=75.12s)]
*  been in the business of regime change. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=79.72s)]
*  And if he indeed believes, contrary to what the White House has said since then, that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=81.44s)]
*  was meant in a broader sense in terms of the ongoing war and the dominance within the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=86.32s)]
*  region. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=91.52s)]
*  But if he indeed believes that this means that President Biden and others want to have [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=92.52s)]
*  him ousted, then he's going to double down, because it's the last thing that he wants [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=97.32s)]
*  to happen to him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=100.36s)]
*  You say he might double down, that this phrase of Biden's might cause him to go even further. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=101.8s)]
*  Tell me what that could mean. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, doubling down could also mean just digging in even further, if we see what I mean, because, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=109.28s)]
*  right now, we've seen the battlefield shifting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=114.92s)]
*  This hasn't been going in the way that he initially intended. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=118.68s)]
*  I mean, there was every evidence that the Russians thought that they would be able to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=121.12s)]
*  take over Ukraine in a matter of days, certainly not weeks and now stretching off into months. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=124.76s)]
*  He may be then just digging down for a much longer conflict, a long grind to actually [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=131.28s)]
*  inflict as much devastation as he possibly can to Ukraine, to teach them a lesson and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=137.0s)]
*  as a lesson as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=141.08s)]
*  So in 2015, President Putin had Russia, the Russian military intervene in Syria. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  The express point of that was to make sure that Bashar al-Assad stayed in power. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=148.67999999999998s)]
*  And now seven years on, Bashar al-Assad is indeed still in power, in fact, has started [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  to go out and about in the neighborhood, meeting with other leaders. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  And so the point from all of this is that Putin is pretty determined as well to make [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=161.32s)]
*  sure that he is still in power. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=165.44s)]
*  So we can say that he should go, but he will do everything that he possibly can to make [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=167.2s)]
*  sure that he can stay in place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=171.28s)]
*  You've spoken about the possibility that he would use battlefield or tactical nuclear [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=173.28s)]
*  weapons. Do you think this is still a possibility? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=178.88s)]
*  And did this past weekend speech make it slightly more of a possibility? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=182.52s)]
*  I don't know whether the speech made it slightly more of a possibility, because, look, to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  be frank, irrespective of the speech, Putin has been convinced that he has to do whatever [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  it takes to win. And he has been definitely contemplating the use of battlefields, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=196.44s)]
*  nuclear weapons, perhaps even some with a longer range. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=201.92s)]
*  We've seen the Russian government announce that they've used the Kinjal, which is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=205.6s)]
*  one of the missile systems that can also be nuclear powered potentially. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=210.88s)]
*  The same with the Iskander missiles that we know that they have positioned in Belarus. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=215.92s)]
*  We've known for some time that Putin and the military planners certainly think about [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=221.0s)]
*  the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event where they think that the war is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  not going in their favor, any kind of war, that they have practiced for these contingencies, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=230.88s)]
*  they've planned for these contingencies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=235.6s)]
*  We've called it escalate to de-escalate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=237.68s)]
*  In other words, they do something that most of the rest of us would not contemplate to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=240.16s)]
*  get everybody else to back down. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  And the mere fact that they've put the forces on alert, that they've had former president [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=246.32s)]
*  Dmitry Medvedev go out and talk about these kinds of possibilities, that's intended to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=251.08s)]
*  intimidate us and intended to make it very clear that they mean business. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=255.84s)]
*  And so Putin is testing whether we are going to back off, in other words, to give him what [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=259.88s)]
*  he wants and to push for a negotiation on terms that he's starting to lay out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=264.24s)]
*  Tell me what would happen if he used battlefield nuclear weapons. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=269.04s)]
*  How would the West, you've been a member of the National Security Council staff, how would [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=274.4s)]
*  the West have to respond? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=279.52s)]
*  Well, this is going to make things extraordinarily difficult, isn't it? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=281.6s)]
*  Look, I think what we would have to do is have a major international response as well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=283.76s)]
*  I mean, I think already we need to be doing some pretty serious diplomacy behind the scenes [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=287.64s)]
*  with other nuclear powers, because it's not just Western powers that are nuclear these [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=291.8s)]
*  days either, is it? I mean, we have China with a very large strategic arsenal and also [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=296.08s)]
*  building up its own stores of strategic tactical as well as medium range nuclear weapons. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=301.68s)]
*  We've been trying to engage the Chinese on the nuclear front. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=307.92s)]
*  We're supposed to have the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review this year coming up in the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=311.12s)]
*  summer, which has already been postponed over and over again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=314.52s)]
*  If Putin and the Kremlin took this step, they would cross a threshold of use that hasn't [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=317.48s)]
*  been crossed, obviously, since the detonation of nuclear weapons during World War Two. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=322.56s)]
*  We've all said that was impermissible. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=327.36s)]
*  That's been the basis of the strategic balance during the Cold War. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=329.12s)]
*  It's been the strategic balance basis between other nuclear powers like India and Pakistan. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=332.6s)]
*  This would literally open the proverbial Pandora's box. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=337.44s)]
*  So what we're going to have to do is get ahead of it and keep pushing on diplomacy to make [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=340.4s)]
*  sure that it is made crystal clear to the Kremlin that this is unacceptable on a global [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=344.88s)]
*  international level, not just in the relationship and the standoff between Russia and the West [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=349.92s)]
*  that he's trying to frame. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=355.0s)]
*  What is the military doctrine of the U.S. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=356.68s)]
*  if there is a use of tactical nuclear weapons in an engagement in Europe that we're [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=359.36s)]
*  involved with? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=364.68s)]
*  Well, we've been going backwards and forwards on our basically strategic nuclear posture. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=366.4s)]
*  And I'm not sure how much we have contemplated this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=372.64s)]
*  I mean, I would actually defer to the Pentagon and to others to ask them for clarification [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=375.44s)]
*  for this, because I think it's very risky also to speculate. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=380.24s)]
*  We have to make this crystal clear in official communications and back channel [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=383.88s)]
*  communications, not just trying to telegraph it during interviews on television, because [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=388.52s)]
*  the Kremlin scrutinized this very closely. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=394.2s)]
*  They jump onto every word that every commentator and other makes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  They're trying to interpret themselves. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=401.0s)]
*  I think this is one where we have to be extraordinarily clear on a government to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=403.0s)]
*  government, military to military and in an international framework, rather than making [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=407.2s)]
*  speculative commentary. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=412.6s)]
*  In the other major news this weekend, President Zelensky gave a very interesting interview [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=414.28s)]
*  to four Russian journalists, which, by the way, was censored so that the Russians [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=419.56s)]
*  couldn't hear it. But he expressed a willingness for diplomacy that would have as [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=423.56s)]
*  part of its endgame a neutral Ukraine. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=429.52s)]
*  Let's start there. Does that make sense? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=433.36s)]
*  Can he declare neutrality? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=435.76s)]
*  And might that give an off ramp to the Russians? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=437.64s)]
*  Well, it depends on how that's done. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=441.23999999999995s)]
*  And I'm sure that he's doing this. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=442.84s)]
*  So he's trying to himself scope out the possibilities. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he's going to have to be able to sell it at home as well. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=447.55999999999995s)]
*  And it can't be neutrality that leaves Ukraine defenseless. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=450.52s)]
*  If we look back to the 1990s when Ukraine was neutral and Ukraine was not a member of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=454.32s)]
*  any military alliance, it was given guarantees by the United States, the United Kingdom [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=459.55999999999995s)]
*  and Russia of its territorial integrity and sovereignty and independence in the Budapest [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=464.76s)]
*  Memorandum of 1994 when Ukraine gave up the Soviet nuclear arsenal that it had inherited. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=469.76s)]
*  All the way along, Ukraine has, in fact, been neutral until relatively recently when it [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=476.56s)]
*  made joining NATO a feature of its constitution, which can certainly be changed. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  The question is, what are the guarantees of Ukraine's safety and security? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=487.08s)]
*  And that will have to be something that's hashed out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=492.24s)]
*  Neutrality shouldn't mean basically neutering or complete neutralization. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=494.2s)]
*  And not being able to have the possibility to defend their territory. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=499.6s)]
*  What we've seen is President Zelensky talking about neutrality. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=503.68s)]
*  We've seen the Russians send signals that they're more interested now in focusing on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  the eastern Ukraine and not trying to take Kiev or the whole country. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=514.2s)]
*  Can you see as a diplomat what the outlines of a possible solution are and what would [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=519.2s)]
*  you propose if you were sitting there saying, OK, I've been made the negotiator. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=526.56s)]
*  Let's try something along these lines. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it gets to the point you've just said about trying things along different [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=534.28s)]
*  lines. I think you have to be very adaptable and flexible. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=538.56s)]
*  Make sure that it's very clear what the floor is below which you're not prepared to go. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=541.36s)]
*  I think President Zelensky himself, by opening up the discussion about neutrality, being [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=547.56s)]
*  very kind of careful about how he's scoping it, has already set forward on one of the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=552.52s)]
*  tracks in which the Russians have expressed a pretty clear demand, which is that Ukraine [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=557.64s)]
*  should not be in NATO. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=564.24s)]
*  The Russians have also made it very clear that what President Putin is seeking is the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=566.28s)]
*  recognition of the annexation of Crimea as an official part of the Russian Federation. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's something that that might also be able to be played with in some way. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=578.0s)]
*  And what I mean by played it in a diplomatic play, figuring out different formulations [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=583.04s)]
*  there that might be able to address both the concerns of the Ukrainians about the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=587.64s)]
*  territorial integrity and that the demand that the Russians have put on the table. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=592.28s)]
*  And of course, it will all depend on how the Russians think that they're doing on the [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=595.92s)]
*  ground, on the battlefield. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=599.28s)]
*  There could be exactly a risk that they're deflecting attention away from other places [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=601.0s)]
*  and intend, in fact, to either continue with the level of attacks that they already are [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  engaging in or even step it up if we think that they're actually diverting their attention [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=613.2s)]
*  elsewhere. Given President Biden's statement that he cannot remain in power and clearly [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=618.96s)]
*  it's up to the Russians to figure out how to do its own regime and leadership, are there [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=625.24s)]
*  ways in Russia that you see that there could be a transition in power? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=630.84s)]
*  Could there be a people's revolt? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  Could the military decide to change? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=636.8s)]
*  Could his own ministers? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=638.9599999999999s)]
*  We've seen a couple of them resign, decide there has to be a change in power. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=640.3599999999999s)]
*  Or is that not likely? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=644.16s)]
*  Well, again, look, it's very dangerous in many respects to speculate, again, because [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=646.64s)]
*  the Kremlin and others will be watching these and other kinds of commentaries. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering if they can gauge in this what our intent is. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=655.3599999999999s)]
*  But let's say Vladimir Putin himself is supposed to have an election, a presidential [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=658.68s)]
*  election in 2024. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=663.88s)]
*  That's two years from now. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=665.76s)]
*  Of course, our assumption was after there was an amendment to the Constitution in 2020, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=667.6s)]
*  that Putin would probably seek at least another six year term that would take him out, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=673.52s)]
*  obviously, to close to the end of this decade and potentially another six year term after [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=679.1600000000001s)]
*  that, which would then have left him in power for 36 years. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  So basically, there is some junctures 2024 and again in another six years, if Putin [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=688.4s)]
*  does in fact remain in power, where there is a presidential election that gives an [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=696.64s)]
*  opportunity for a change, a change that could be managed in somewhere. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=700.44s)]
*  There could be a successor that's designated. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=703.4s)]
*  The group around Putin could work together to smooth something over. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=706.28s)]
*  But 2024 has got to be looming pretty high in Putin's mind and in the minds of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=710.88s)]
*  everybody else around him. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=715.72s)]
*  Unless, of course, now the war is still grinding on and they decide to then declare [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=717.08s)]
*  martial law. And then I think all bets are off. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  And some of the other scenarios that one might contemplate could possibly come into [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=725.12s)]
*  play if the situation in Russia gets dire. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=728.96s)]
*  But let's just say this is very uncertain. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=731.84s)]
*  This is highly fluid. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=734.2s)]
*  And it's also a very dangerous moment for the West as well as for Russia. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=735.48s)]
*  You've written a co-authored a book called Mr. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=740.6s)]
*  Putin, an operative in the Kremlin, I think is how you describe him. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=743.52s)]
*  And you say in some way he's not ideological, that he's very much just a [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=748.36s)]
*  maneuverer and one who believes in the state, a real statist. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=753.76s)]
*  Tell me how that plays into what he's doing. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=758.36s)]
*  Well, look, I think over time, it's not that he's become more ideological, but [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=761.6s)]
*  he's become much more fixed in his views since we finished the book. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=765.04s)]
*  Of course, quite a lot has happened since then. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=770.4s)]
*  And what we've seen is Putin become much more obsessed with history. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=773.6s)]
*  That was one of the factors in the book. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  We had a whole chapter called The History Man about how Putin interprets Russian [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=778.88s)]
*  history and starts to increasingly place himself in it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  I think now Putin is thinking all about his place in history, his legacy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  He sees himself in the pantheon of the Russian Tsars and of the great Soviet [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=790.52s)]
*  leaders, clearly on a par with Stalin, who was in power for 30 years and, of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=795.3199999999999s)]
*  course, took some twists and turns in his time in office there. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=800.28s)]
*  And Putin has become very much fixed on himself and the state as being fused [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=804.4s)]
*  together. And that's part of the problem that we're facing right now. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=809.04s)]
*  Your description of him as a history man and obsessed with history, of course, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=811.84s)]
*  brings up the Santayana quote that those who cannot remember the past are doomed [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=817.84s)]
*  to repeat it. As a history professor, I sometimes worry there's a corollary that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=821.64s)]
*  leaders who remember the past too well are condemned to repeat it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=825.96s)]
*  Do you think that that may be a problem, is that he's so obsessed with Russian [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=829.8s)]
*  history? I think it is. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=833.8s)]
*  It is. I think that one of the things that we really see here is that he has [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=836.1199999999999s)]
*  found it very hard to disassociate himself and the present from the past. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=841.7199999999999s)]
*  Everything that he has said about Ukraine is basically a mishmash of historical [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=847.04s)]
*  time periods put together in one narrative that he himself has formulated, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  that any professional historian and Russian historian and regional historian [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=857.12s)]
*  could easily poke holes in. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=861.12s)]
*  And he started to see himself, as I said earlier, as in many respects, a kind of an [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=863.4799999999999s)]
*  embodiment of the Russian state. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=868.92s)]
*  And the people around him have actually said on numerous occasions that there is no [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=870.76s)]
*  Russia without Vladimir Putin. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  So this makes the stakes extraordinarily high for all of us. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=876.16s)]
*  How you deal with somebody who is operating in a framework where they think [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=879.3199999999999s)]
*  themselves and the state are fused together and they can't really step back [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=883.3599999999999s)]
*  from this. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=886.44s)]
*  Let me put this in the larger context of history. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  You've written a great book. I read it this weekend. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=890.8800000000001s)]
*  I recommend it, which is There is Nothing for You Here. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=893.36s)]
*  And I think that refers to the economic opportunities in Russia, but also around [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=897.36s)]
*  the world, that we've gone through a period in which economic opportunities and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  growth have been problematic, especially for people who used to get up in the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  morning, play by the rules and think they could succeed. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=914.12s)]
*  How do you think this moment in history is being determined by big, large forces [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=917.24s)]
*  in your book? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=923.6s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, we were already before we got into this war in Ukraine or [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=925.4s)]
*  rather Vladimir Putin put us into this war in Ukraine, starting to enter another [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=929.84s)]
*  phase that I described in the book. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=933.88s)]
*  I mean, the starting point in the book is really the 1980s and the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=935.72s)]
*  deindustrialization that many countries, particularly the United Kingdom and the [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=938.88s)]
*  United States, started to experience from that juncture on and the impact that [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=945.48s)]
*  that ultimately had on socioeconomic situation and then feeding into populist [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=951.48s)]
*  politics. As you mentioned, I did talk about what happened in Russia in the 1990s [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=957.4s)]
*  when the country moved extraordinarily rapidly from state-based economy to a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=962.24s)]
*  private market-based economy. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=970.08s)]
*  Now, over time, Putin has put the state back in that economy again. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=972.0s)]
*  And we are seeing now with the sanctions and the cutting off of Russia from the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=976.4s)]
*  economy, a huge blow to the Russia that Putin has built up since 2000 in his [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=981.48s)]
*  period and the presidency. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=988.44s)]
*  Russia is going to go into a very steep recession. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=990.44s)]
*  Many of the gains that the Russian economy and the Russian population has [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=993.5600000000001s)]
*  result made over the last 22 years since the dislocations and the wrenching, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  rapid deindustrialization of the 1990s are going to be lost. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1003.5200000000001s)]
*  I fear that we're going to be in another major period of dislocation and shifts. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1007.08s)]
*  And this is not going to be a very easy period for any of us in Europe and in the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  United States to manage with. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  There's lots of opportunity there as well. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1018.44s)]
*  But we're going to have to pay very close attention to the people who get left [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1020.44s)]
*  behind. And in Russia itself, I think this is really going to be a return to those [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1023.5200000000001s)]
*  severe dislocations and political upheavals of the period that they thought that [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1028.76s)]
*  they'd left well behind at the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1033.2s)]
*  And we're going to have to figure out how we reintegrate Russia. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1037.04s)]
*  Our war is not with the Russian people, but the problem is how to get Vladimir [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1040.0800000000002s)]
*  Putin and the people around him in the Kremlin who decided to embark on this war [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1045.04s)]
*  to change their course. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1049.2s)]
*  Dr. Fiona Hill, it's always great to talk to you. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHdhfd5zWrk&t=1050.92s)]
