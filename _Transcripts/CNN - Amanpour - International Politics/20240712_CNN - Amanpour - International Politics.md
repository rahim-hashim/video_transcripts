Video Description: In Gaza, 120 hostages are still held captive by Hamas. In his opening remarks last night, President Biden spoke of his determination to arrive at a ceasefire deal, saying, “There’s still gaps to close. We’re making progress.” Behind at least some of these gaps is believed to be Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who reportedly hardened his demands for a hostage deal once again. Bianna Golodryga spoke with Andrey Kozlov, who was rescued after eight months' captivity. A Russian-Israeli citizen, Andrey had been living in Israel for only 18 months when he was taken from the Nova music festival on October 7th. Along with three others, he was rescued from Gaza’s Nuseirat camp on June 8th. In an exclusive TV interview Andrey shared his experience and his reflections after just one month of freedom.

**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg)
*  Well, this week, I spoke with rescued hostage Andrei Kozlov, who was held captive by Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=0.0s)]
*  for eight months. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  A Russian-Israeli citizen, Andrei had only been living in Israel for about a year, when [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=7.12s)]
*  he was taken from the Nova Music Festival on October 7. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=11.26s)]
*  Along with three others, he was rescued from Gaza's Nusrat camp on June 8. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=15.08s)]
*  In an exclusive television interview, Andrei shared his experience with me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=19.96s)]
*  And I started by asking how he was feeling after just one month of freedom. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=23.86s)]
*  I remember if I see some photos from my previous life before Gaza, that I remember, of course, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=53.86s)]
*  when I was in Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=62.62s)]
*  It's like main reasons of my tears. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=65.32s)]
*  Once you got into Gaza, what happened? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=69.76s)]
*  When we went through the wall, through the gate, we saw a big field. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=73.08s)]
*  This field was full of people, civilian people probably, I don't know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=83.4s)]
*  They were really happy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  They had savage energy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  And they were really like... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  I was... [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=98.86s)]
*  I hold handle of the car and somebody started to... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=101.6s)]
*  Were you scared? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=110.64s)]
*  It was a condition of shock. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=113.08s)]
*  I was not scared. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=115.16s)]
*  I didn't realize what's going on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=118.6s)]
*  And they took us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=121.6s)]
*  They tied up hands like this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=122.6s)]
*  They put us on the floor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=126.12s)]
*  And I started to explain them like... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=129.58s)]
*  I'm Russian. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=132.54s)]
*  I'm Russian. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=133.54s)]
*  I'm Russian. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=134.54s)]
*  Like... [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=135.54s)]
*  I don't speak Hebrew. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=136.54s)]
*  I speak only Russian and English. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=137.54s)]
*  To explain them what can we do. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=141.74s)]
*  Some guy was from the left side of me and he has like a gun. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=145.46s)]
*  I tried to touch him and ask him, like, you ask kill us? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=150.9s)]
*  You asked him if they were planning to kill you? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=160.1s)]
*  Yeah, I asked him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=162.86s)]
*  It's only one thought that I had. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=164.34s)]
*  What are they going to do with us? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  In couple of hours, they brought Almuk, like the same day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=169.3s)]
*  And in some moment, one guy, he was like... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  I was really scared about him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=183.14s)]
*  I was really afraid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=185.26s)]
*  And he took fabric from my ass and showed me with signs like, I, tomorrow, you, I will [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  film you and I will kill you. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=201.7s)]
*  It was in the first day of our being in Gaza. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  Your mom said that you were tied up like that for two months. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=209.5s)]
*  The first three days was with ropes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=213.06s)]
*  Until middle of December, we were in chains. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=218.06s)]
*  You were tied with chains? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=222.82s)]
*  With chains. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  They were afraid that we will run away, like, maybe, I don't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=225.42s)]
*  But in December, they took off and we were free. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=230.9s)]
*  And always the three of you together? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=235.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=237.06s)]
*  But in some days, in three days, they started to treat us a little bit better. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=238.06s)]
*  They started to give us food and you already understand that probably they are not going [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=244.22s)]
*  to kill us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  We are kidnapped. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  And they explained us, like, we want to change. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=254.34s)]
*  They, like, with signs, with signs, like, you are going to Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=258.74s)]
*  Our people go to Gaza and to West Bank. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=265.46s)]
*  And you don't understand, like, what will happen, like, when we will go home. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=269.74s)]
*  And you ask them, like, what's going on outside? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=276.98s)]
*  They told us some news that is going on between Gaza and Israel, between USA and Israel. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  And during all these eight months, we had, like, waves of our mood. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=293.22s)]
*  Like, we have some good news and after, like, nothing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  Like, the deal broken. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=305.46000000000004s)]

*  Like, bomb, shooting outside. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=311.62s)]
*  A lot of bombs. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=316.5s)]
*  And the night you wake up, like, it was a lot of times in different places. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=318.58s)]
*  You woke up, you wake up and, like, because of the really big bomb, fall down, like, near [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=325.3s)]
*  to your place, like, 50 meters, maybe 100. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=333.7s)]
*  It's like sound from hell. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZv1Dg4TZYg&t=337.54s)]
