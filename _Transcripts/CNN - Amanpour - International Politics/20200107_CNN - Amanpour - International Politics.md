# Stephen Hadley on Trump’s Decision to Kill Qasem Soleimani  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ)
*  Can we just start by admitting and just putting it out there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that Ghassam Soleimani was no angel, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=3.4s)]
*  that he was the architect of malign Iranian influence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=5.9s)]
*  and mastermind of military adventures [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=10.64s)]
*  and responsible for the deaths of so many Americans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=12.5s)]
*  and so much other negative influence in that region? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=16.04s)]
*  But the question to somebody like yourself is, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=19.14s)]
*  was the assassination of this personality at this time [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  the wise choice for America? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=26.54s)]
*  And what is the route ahead? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  What is the next step? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=29.88s)]
*  That of course is the right question. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=31.38s)]
*  Why did the president do it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=33.74s)]
*  What they've said is they did it to forestall [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=35.8s)]
*  imminent attacks on Americans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=38.9s)]
*  I think they also did it to try to show by a big move [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=41.3s)]
*  by taking out Soleimani to try to deter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=45.64s)]
*  further Iranian action. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=49.2s)]
*  Iran through one of its surrogate forces in Iraq [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=51.44s)]
*  had for months been attacking US targets. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=56.5s)]
*  That's through Qatab Hezbollah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=61.14s)]
*  And I think the administration wanted to send a message [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  to the Iranian regime that this had to stop [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=67.14s)]
*  or there would be consequences. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=70.14s)]
*  So I think it was to prevent an imminent attack. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=72.1s)]
*  And I think it was also to try to send [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=74.94s)]
*  a broader deterrence message to try to halt [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=76.84s)]
*  an escalating set of attacks on American forces in Iraq. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=80.0s)]
*  So you agree then that this was the right thing to do? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=83.96s)]
*  Don't know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=87.5s)]
*  It'll depend on how it goes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=88.34s)]
*  And it's in some sense it's too soon to say. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=90.86s)]
*  There are a lot of people who've said [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=92.96s)]
*  this could be a disaster. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=94.34s)]
*  It rallies the Iranian people around the Iranian regime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=95.94s)]
*  It may result in the Iraqis kicking out American forces. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=99.06s)]
*  It will result in Iran getting out of the nuclear deal, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=103.34s)]
*  retaliating. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=106.5s)]
*  There are a lot of doomsday scenarios out there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=107.5s)]
*  They may come to pass. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, it is also possible [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=111.84s)]
*  that this will deter escalating Iranian activity [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=114.44s)]
*  directly and through its proxies against American forces. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=118.2s)]
*  Second of all, it will put more pressure on Iran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=122.68s)]
*  It'll make clear that this administration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  is willing to escalate militarily. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=127.78s)]
*  There is likely to be more sanctions and more constraints [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=130.24s)]
*  on Iranian oil exports. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=133.5s)]
*  And the problem for the regime is whether that hardship [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  reignites the demonstrations that occurred in October [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=139.66s)]
*  and November in Iran that the regime was only able [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=143.6s)]
*  to put down through very harsh military measures. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=147.1s)]
*  And the question is whether that kind of threat [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=150.64s)]
*  will force the regime to be pragmatic [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=152.9s)]
*  and to return to some kind of negotiations [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=155.5s)]
*  where we would talk about their nuclear weapons, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  their ballistic missiles, and also their disruptive activities [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=161.5s)]
*  in the region. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  So it's too soon to say. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=165.7s)]
*  Bold move could go badly, but there are also scenarios [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=167.2s)]
*  where it could have a positive outcome. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUzOaVva0WQ&t=170.95999999999998s)]
