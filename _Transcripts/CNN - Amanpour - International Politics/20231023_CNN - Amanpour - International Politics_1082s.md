*  Thanks, Christiane. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=26.76s)]
*  Ben Sheehan, thanks so much for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=27.7s)]
*  talking with us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=28.72s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=30.18s)]
*  I think some people know your [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=31.86s)]
*  work because you've been in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=32.82s)]
*  comedy for a long time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=34.66s)]
*  I mean, you were the executive [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=36.22s)]
*  producer at the comedy website [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=37.32s)]
*  Funny or Die, and then you [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=39.1s)]
*  pivoted to civics education. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=42.0s)]
*  So, I mean, you've got a lot of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=44.66s)]
*  different constituencies. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=45.94s)]
*  The reason we called you is that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=48.34s)]
*  you posted something on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Instagram that just kind of went [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=52.04s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=55.04s)]
*  And it just seemed so different [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=55.940000000000005s)]
*  from the tone of so much of what [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=59.22s)]
*  we were seeing on social media [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  at the time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=61.92s)]
*  I think it really caught [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=62.38s)]
*  people's attention. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=63.56s)]
*  One of the things, what you said [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=64.36s)]
*  was, if you have less empathy [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=65.56s)]
*  towards victims because of how [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=68.06s)]
*  you feel about their government, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=69.5s)]
*  propaganda is working on you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=71.3s)]
*  That was the first slide out of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=73.5s)]
*  five. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=74.8s)]
*  We'll talk about the others. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  But, Jen, what inspired you? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=76.6s)]
*  You know, I had been working the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=79.1s)]
*  last several months on a project [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=80.88s)]
*  around propaganda, actually the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=83.64s)]
*  history of propaganda, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=85.28s)]
*  specifically anti-Semitic [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=86.28s)]
*  propaganda. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=87.6s)]
*  And seeing some of the posts that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=88.58s)]
*  were happening on Instagram and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=90.08s)]
*  other social media platforms, I [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=91.78s)]
*  was seeing echoes of some of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=93.28s)]
*  that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=95.28s)]
*  So propaganda was already top of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=95.48s)]
*  mind. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=97.12s)]
*  And my takeaway from all of the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=98.18s)]
*  research I was doing is that the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=100.18s)]
*  main goal of propaganda is to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=102.26s)]
*  dehumanize not just the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=104.16s)]
*  recipient, but also people other [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  than the recipient in order to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  justify support for honestly [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=109.82s)]
*  atrocious actions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=112.6s)]
*  So I started to see posts that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=113.97999999999999s)]
*  were disrespectful towards [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=116.22s)]
*  Israelis, disrespectful towards [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=119.22s)]
*  And I just wanted to take an [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=120.22s)]
*  opportunity to remind people [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=121.32s)]
*  that this is about everyone's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=123.02s)]
*  humanity. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=125.82s)]
*  This is not about looking at [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=126.3s)]
*  somebody as though they are less [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=127.8s)]
*  than you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=129.2s)]
*  And we need to keep that in mind [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=130.14s)]
*  so that we can inoculate [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  ourselves from propaganda. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=132.44s)]
*  Your post was seen by hundreds of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=135.29999999999998s)]
*  millions of people, which is just [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=138.14s)]
*  hard even to wrap your head [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=141.04s)]
*  around. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=142.42s)]
*  It was shared by celebrities, the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  Israeli actress Gail Gadot, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=145.0s)]
*  Gwyneth Paltrow, Viola Davis, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=146.94s)]
*  Padma Lakshmi, the comedian Sarah [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Silverman. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=150.0s)]
*  The first slide, I'm just going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=150.68s)]
*  to say it again, okay? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  It said, if you have less empathy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=153.88s)]
*  towards victims because of how [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  you feel about their government, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  propaganda is working on you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=158.72s)]
*  That was the first slide. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=160.62s)]
*  The second, the goal of propaganda [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=162.02s)]
*  is to dehumanize. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  It works to dehumanize Israelis [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=166.02s)]
*  and it works to dehumanize [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=168.16s)]
*  Gazans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=169.66s)]
*  Slide three, propaganda is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=171.08s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=172.88s)]
*  It seeps into us over time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=173.72s)]
*  It seeks to block our empathy [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=175.56s)]
*  receptors so when we see violence, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=177.06s)]
*  we rationalize away our human [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=179.62s)]
*  response. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=181.66s)]
*  Slide four, I like to think most [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=182.96s)]
*  of us are above propaganda, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=184.8s)]
*  this weekend reminded me how [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=186.24s)]
*  widespread it is because a lot of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=188.6s)]
*  people reacted to this violence [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=190.04s)]
*  with justification, not empathy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=191.38s)]
*  I guess it's not surprising, but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=193.04s)]
*  it's still heartbreaking. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=194.54s)]
*  Slide five, killing innocent [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=196.18s)]
*  Palestinians is horrific. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=197.98s)]
*  Killing innocent Israelis is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=199.9s)]
*  horrific. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=201.6s)]
*  If you don't feel the same, I [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=202.4s)]
*  think you should ask yourself why [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=203.7s)]
*  that is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=205.5s)]
*  I mean, it just, hmm. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=207.1s)]
*  Honestly, it's just so succinct [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=210.14s)]
*  and it's not poetry, but it kind [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=212.68s)]
*  of feels like it is in the sense [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  that it captures something so [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=217.56s)]
*  profoundly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=219.66s)]
*  It almost like cuts you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=220.56s)]
*  And I was just kind of wondering [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=222.98s)]
*  how you were able to distill [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=226.5s)]
*  something into so few words. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, not to to minimize what I [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=233.0s)]
*  wrote, but this is the world we [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=236.18s)]
*  live in where I was in a taxi [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=238.58s)]
*  ride to the airport and I just [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=241.72s)]
*  wrote it down in five minutes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  I sort of tried to distill my [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=245.62s)]
*  immediate reaction. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  And again, if it wasn't the fact [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=248.96s)]
*  that I've been working on this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=250.5s)]
*  research project, which is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=252.4s)]
*  honestly looking at dog whistles, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=254.5s)]
*  anti-semitic dog whistles and how [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=255.74s)]
*  those over time, the repetition [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=257.56s)]
*  of those and the variety of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=259.86s)]
*  those can slowly cause people to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=261.3s)]
*  think a certain way. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=263.94s)]
*  So it really is sort of like a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=264.76000000000005s)]
*  faucet dripping rather than a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  fire hose. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  I saw posts like this in twenty [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=268.3s)]
*  twenty one then when there was [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=270.14000000000004s)]
*  the last sort of major conflict [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=271.16s)]
*  in the region and even going back [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=274.32000000000005s)]
*  to twenty fourteen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  And so really not to really being [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  aware of just a single post, but [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=279.66s)]
*  also how the totality and the sum [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=281.8s)]
*  of posts over time bit by bit can [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=283.94s)]
*  sort of chip away at our shared [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=286.29999999999995s)]
*  humanity. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  You also wrote an essay in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  Daily Beast about it, also about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=290.02s)]

*  but then also kind of reacting to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=294.28s)]
*  the reaction to it and sort of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=297.26s)]
*  expanding more on your your [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=299.2s)]
*  thoughts about this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=301.76s)]
*  The how do you see this playing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=303.11999999999995s)]
*  out if you don't, you know, going [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=306.14s)]
*  back to sort of the essay, how [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=307.73999999999995s)]
*  have you seen this playing out [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  and have you seen it playing out [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  in any ways that surprised you? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Sure. So, you know, I talk about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  in the essay sort of three [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  different types of propaganda. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=319.14s)]
*  There's distortion, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=321.94s)]
*  There's taking something that is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=323.09999999999997s)]
*  a video of an event from a year [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=324.73999999999995s)]
*  ago, five years ago, several [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  weeks ago, and purporting as if [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  it happened yesterday or the day [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  before. Right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=332.05999999999995s)]
*  You know, we can take videos out [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=332.73999999999995s)]
*  of context and change the caption [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=334.58s)]
*  and suddenly people will latch [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=336.94s)]
*  onto it as if it's real and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  gospel and start sharing it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  And that can have legitimately [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=341.5s)]
*  damaging consequences. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=342.79999999999995s)]
*  And that is not in any way [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=343.78s)]
*  exclusive to one side of this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=345.24s)]
*  conflict. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  The other thing is, you know, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  I've talked about this a lot in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=349.92s)]
*  my own work around civics, but [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=351.02000000000004s)]
*  applies to history as well, is [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=352.36s)]
*  that we Americans are not well [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=353.72s)]
*  educated, any of us, really, the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  vast majority of us in the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=358.0s)]
*  history of this region. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=359.8s)]
*  And so there are bad actors [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=360.88000000000005s)]
*  sometimes that will take framing [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=362.62s)]
*  devices that are overly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=363.94000000000005s)]
*  simplified, that condense things [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  down into really easily [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=367.36s)]
*  understandable framework. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's appealing because it's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=371.88000000000005s)]
*  really daunting to self-educate. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  And then the third thing, and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=374.7s)]
*  that's sort of a false [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=376.42s)]
*  compare, the false comparison I [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=377.18s)]
*  like to call. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=378.38s)]
*  And then the last thing is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=379.26s)]
*  omission. Right. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=380.22s)]
*  Is this is where I talk about my [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=381.26s)]
*  own blind spots. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=382.96s)]
*  And that came it took me a long [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  time to realize the blind spots [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=385.26s)]
*  that I had as somebody who has [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=386.98s)]
*  studied this region, but [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=388.7s)]
*  definitely was given a slanted [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=390.02s)]
*  version of it growing up in my [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=391.94s)]
*  own religious education, my [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  Jewish education, my school [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=395.14s)]
*  education, university. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=396.5s)]
*  And so really looking inward at [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=397.86s)]
*  myself, always challenging myself [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=400.18s)]
*  to keep reading reliable, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=401.9s)]
*  legitimate, factual sources. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=403.82s)]
*  But the truth is that we are [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=406.32s)]
*  always trying to find ways to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  fill our knowledge gaps and that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=409.36s)]
*  we're always going to have [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=410.88s)]
*  knowledge gaps. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=411.8s)]
*  So being aware of what our own [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=412.64s)]
*  shortcomings is, is, I think, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=414.04s)]
*  something that myself included, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=415.36s)]
*  a lot of people can relate to and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=418.04s)]
*  have a responsibility to keep [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=419.48s)]
*  trying to correct. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=421.08s)]
*  How did you come to that insight [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=422.08s)]
*  for yourself that that you had [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=423.52s)]
*  knowledge gaps, even though, you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=425.76s)]
*  know, you're Jewish by heritage, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=427.24s)]
*  have, you know, certainly [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=429.08s)]
*  connections to the story as well [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=430.28s)]
*  as the religious importance, the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  personal importance of Israel to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=436.74s)]
*  so many people, people in your [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=438.38s)]
*  family. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  So how did you how did you see [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=440.5s)]
*  that in yourself, those [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=441.97999999999996s)]
*  knowledge gaps? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=443.38s)]
*  So I had, you know, talking to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=444.62s)]
*  Palestinian friends is important [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=446.42s)]
*  to have people who have [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=448.94s)]
*  different backgrounds than mine [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=449.94s)]
*  and having conversations with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=451.41999999999996s)]
*  them. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  And they were kind enough to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=452.82s)]
*  take, you know, the time to have [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=453.86s)]
*  those conversations, which I'm [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=456.02s)]
*  sure are painful. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=457.38s)]
*  I don't want to make it anybody's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=458.62s)]
*  else's responsibility to to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=459.82s)]
*  educate me. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=461.58s)]
*  But it's it's good to have [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=462.12s)]
*  friends, you know, of of varied [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=463.56s)]
*  backgrounds who are willing to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=465.72s)]
*  take that time. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=467.6s)]
*  But it really was a conversation [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=468.20000000000005s)]
*  that I had in 2019. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  I went on a trip to to to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel and Palestine. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=473.96000000000004s)]
*  So we spent most of the time in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=475.48s)]
*  Israel, but we did spend [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=477.36s)]
*  some time in Ramallah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=480.44s)]

*  and also before. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=497.98s)]
*  And it caused me to question my [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  own background to do more [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=501.86s)]
*  research, but to find little gaps [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=504.94s)]
*  in my knowledge and things that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=507.62s)]
*  may have been omitted. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=508.82000000000005s)]
*  And the thing that's hard with [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=510.38s)]
*  omission is that you can present [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=511.42s)]
*  something that is entirely 100 [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=513.78s)]
*  percent factual, but simply leaves [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  out information. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=517.14s)]
*  So you're not distorting the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=517.82s)]
*  information. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=519.46s)]
*  You're just not giving the entire [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=520.32s)]
*  picture. And it's very hard when [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=521.76s)]
*  there are things that we don't [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=523.38s)]
*  know that we don't know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=524.64s)]
*  And so it really is important to [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=526.24s)]
*  have conversations with people of [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=527.8000000000001s)]
*  different backgrounds to go to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=529.22s)]
*  these places if you are fortunate [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=530.76s)]
*  and lucky enough to have the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=532.12s)]
*  opportunity as I was to go on a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=533.0400000000001s)]

*  But the other thing I sort of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=537.76s)]
*  talked about in the essay is that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=538.76s)]
*  social media works to put us in [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=540.0s)]
*  silos, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=541.96s)]
*  The algorithms game it so that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=542.98s)]
*  we're constantly being fed things [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  that we tend to already agree [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=546.0s)]
*  with. And so we're not just [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  breaking out of knowledge gaps in [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=549.16s)]
*  our own lives. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=550.9s)]
*  We're also breaking out of these [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=551.6999999999999s)]
*  sort of silos that we put into [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=552.98s)]
*  just by the nature of using social [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  media. So hopefully people can be [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=557.66s)]
*  more aware of that, follow [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=559.62s)]
*  creators that may be different, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=561.2199999999999s)]
*  have different backgrounds, talk [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=563.4599999999999s)]
*  to people who have different [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=564.74s)]
*  backgrounds if you're able to go [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=565.8199999999999s)]
*  to places. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=567.0s)]
*  But this is a lot of [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=567.8199999999999s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=568.9s)]
*  But as I mentioned in the essay, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  it's honestly the least that we [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=570.86s)]
*  can do. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=572.18s)]
*  I wanted to go back to something [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=572.74s)]
*  you talked about. You talk about [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=573.9399999999999s)]
*  false comparison. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=574.9399999999999s)]
*  You have an interesting analysis [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=576.9399999999999s)]
*  in your Daily Beast essay of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=579.84s)]
*  people who compare the [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=581.28s)]
*  relationship that Black Americans [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=582.4s)]
*  have, that many Black Americans [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=584.24s)]
*  have with law enforcement in the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=586.32s)]
*  United States and the one that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=588.76s)]
*  Palestinians have with the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  Israeli Defense Force. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=591.76s)]
*  Could you just talk a little bit [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=593.32s)]
*  about your thoughts about that? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=594.24s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=596.28s)]
*  So, you know, and I respect the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=596.92s)]
*  approach of many journalists to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=600.12s)]
*  try to find ways to create [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  analogies where their audience can [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  understand a situation. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  The problem is, is when you stop [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=607.78s)]
*  at the analogy. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=609.7s)]
*  So, like I mentioned, you know, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=610.74s)]
*  in a vacuum, the relationship [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=611.86s)]
*  between Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=613.34s)]
*  the government defense forces and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=615.4200000000001s)]
*  Palestinian civilians is analogous [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=616.98s)]
*  to a relationship between, you [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=619.6600000000001s)]
*  know, the police force and police [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=622.1s)]
*  officers in the United States, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=624.14s)]
*  which are local governments and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=625.98s)]
*  African-American civilians. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=628.38s)]
*  But aside from that, we have [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  different countries, we have [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=632.1s)]
*  different religions, we have [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=633.62s)]
*  different peoples, we have [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=634.74s)]
*  different relationships and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=635.76s)]
*  dynamics. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=637.8s)]
*  There's so much history outside [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=638.6s)]
*  of that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=640.48s)]
*  So I think the risk is in an [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=640.96s)]
*  effort to create an [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=642.84s)]
*  understanding of what's going on. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=645.6s)]
*  We tend to leave out all of that [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=649.24s)]
*  context of what makes it a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=650.8s)]
*  different situation. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=652.28s)]
*  And that involves a lot of, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=653.32s)]
*  again, a lot of research because [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=655.4s)]
*  we don't teach this stuff enough [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=657.0s)]
*  in our schools. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=658.28s)]
*  We don't teach history enough. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=658.96s)]
*  We don't teach civics enough. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=660.12s)]
*  And I would also add we don't [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=661.16s)]
*  teach media literacy enough. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=662.2s)]
*  This is something that's become [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  more and more of an important [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=664.74s)]
*  focus for people to understand [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=665.86s)]
*  how to be good, responsible news [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=667.62s)]
*  consumers on the Internet and on [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=669.86s)]
*  social media platforms when you [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=672.1800000000001s)]
*  are being inundated with both [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=673.82s)]
*  accurate sources and also, I [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=675.38s)]
*  would say, more often than not, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=676.82s)]
*  inaccurate sources. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=678.38s)]
*  What's the through line of your [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=679.78s)]
*  career? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=681.14s)]
*  Do you see one? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=681.5s)]
*  I mean, so comedy to civics [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=682.3000000000001s)]
*  education to, I mean, I don't [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=686.6600000000001s)]
*  know, are they related? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=690.3000000000001s)]
*  Either I get bored easily or [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=692.84s)]
*  there is a through line that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=695.3199999999999s)]
*  exists. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=696.72s)]
*  I often think about an event [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=697.3199999999999s)]
*  that happened when I was five [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=699.92s)]
*  years old. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=700.8s)]
*  I was sitting at the dinner [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=701.84s)]
*  table and my parents worked in [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=702.64s)]
*  the government or with the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=704.16s)]
*  government in politics. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=704.92s)]
*  And my mom took a napkin and she [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=706.16s)]
*  drew a house and on one side of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=708.0s)]
*  the house, she wrote the number [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=709.28s)]
*  435 and on the other side of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=710.16s)]
*  the house, she wrote the number [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=712.0s)]
*  100. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=712.88s)]
*  And that was my first lesson [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=713.6s)]
*  about Congress. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=714.68s)]
*  And it was very simple. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=715.56s)]
*  It was literally back of the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=716.76s)]
*  napkin. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=717.84s)]
*  And several decades later, I'm [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=718.52s)]
*  trying to find ways to take [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=721.48s)]
*  that napkin, take that pen and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  simplify things for other [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=724.74s)]
*  people so that they can have [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=726.3000000000001s)]

*  And I think that is very much [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=779.36s)]
*  the case in both with Israel [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=780.8s)]

*  You have governments that are [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=784.74s)]

*  represent the majority of the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=787.18s)]
*  civilians of the voters, as [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=789.2199999999999s)]
*  we've seen, by the way, in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=791.06s)]
*  Israel in the last year, we had [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=792.78s)]
*  people, hundreds of thousands, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=794.54s)]
*  taking to the streets to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=795.8599999999999s)]
*  protest Netanyahu's attempt to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=796.8599999999999s)]
*  weaken the Supreme Court, a [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=798.9799999999999s)]
*  whole branch of the government. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=802.02s)]
*  So we're seeing the results of [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=803.78s)]
*  something when we have [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=806.06s)]
*  extremist leaders that don't [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=807.3399999999999s)]
*  represent who I believe to be [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=808.6999999999999s)]
*  the majority or the majority [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=811.02s)]
*  sentiment of civilians. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=812.14s)]
*  And I'm seeing the beginning [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=813.38s)]
*  stages of that in this country [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=814.66s)]
*  with things like with [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=816.66s)]
*  gerrymandering, other ways to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=818.14s)]
*  sort of tilt the playing field. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=819.3s)]
*  And so I think it's really [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=820.38s)]
*  important for people to be aware [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=821.2199999999999s)]
*  of that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=822.8199999999999s)]
*  And through all the work that I [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=823.18s)]
*  do, whether it's political, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=824.62s)]
*  historical, the comedic, I'm [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=826.38s)]
*  always coming back to that same [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=828.38s)]
*  point, which is we need to have [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=829.78s)]
*  a shared understanding of facts [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=831.0999999999999s)]
*  and reality in order to make the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=832.8199999999999s)]
*  best decisions for who our [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=834.9s)]
*  leaders should be. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=835.8599999999999s)]
*  But wait, wait, wait. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=836.62s)]
*  Aren't we already there? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=837.3s)]
*  We already don't have a shared [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=838.5s)]
*  version of reality. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=840.02s)]
*  I mean, you have members of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=840.88s)]
*  Congress who do not accept, at [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=841.84s)]
*  least they say that they do not [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=843.92s)]
*  accept, that the January 6th mob [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=845.24s)]
*  attack on the Capitol was an [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  effort to overthrow the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  government. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=850.04s)]
*  I mean, you have elected [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=850.48s)]
*  leaders, elected officials [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=851.68s)]
*  saying that these were just [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=853.92s)]
*  tourists taking a tour. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=858.12s)]
*  And they were there and they [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=858.64s)]
*  were there. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=859.84s)]
*  And so, you know, I don't know, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=861.0s)]
*  I kind of aren't we already [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=863.36s)]
*  there in a way, or is that one [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=864.64s)]
*  of those false comparisons that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=865.8s)]
*  you're warning us about? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  No, I think I think we [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=868.42s)]
*  definitely are there when it [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=869.7s)]
*  comes to when it comes to [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=870.86s)]
*  certain things like what [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=872.14s)]
*  happened on on January 6th. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=873.02s)]
*  I also want to note the role [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=875.46s)]
*  that, you know, gerrymandering [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=876.78s)]
*  plays in selecting our members [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=877.98s)]
*  of the House. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=879.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=880.62s)]
*  We have the vast majority of [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  districts are not competitive [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=883.0600000000001s)]
*  and they're drawn in a way so [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=884.58s)]
*  that only a minority of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=886.26s)]
*  districts in the House are [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=887.58s)]
*  competitive. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=888.9s)]
*  So it's sort of things like that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=889.54s)]
*  that are manipulating who ends [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=891.1800000000001s)]
*  up in Congress. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=893.02s)]
*  And I don't think because of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=894.1s)]
*  that, that they are accurately [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=895.62s)]
*  representative of public [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=897.02s)]
*  pain. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=898.24s)]
*  You talk about the need to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=898.84s)]
*  retain empathy at a time like [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=900.88s)]
*  this. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=903.48s)]
*  And, you know, I think you and [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=905.48s)]
*  I are sitting here in our [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=906.8s)]
*  respective places and we're [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=908.12s)]
*  clean, safe, warm and dry. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=910.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=912.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking about these [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  people who watch their [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=914.0s)]
*  relatives get gunned down in [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=916.64s)]
*  their kitchens. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=918.72s)]
*  Who watch their loved ones get [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=921.48s)]
*  shoved in the back of a car by [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=923.4s)]
*  their hair and dragged to Gaza [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=926.2s)]
*  to be held as hostages. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=929.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=930.86s)]
*  Not knowing what is happening [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=931.4200000000001s)]
*  to them. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=933.58s)]
*  And I'm also thinking about [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=933.82s)]
*  people who've watched their [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=934.86s)]
*  loved ones or other people they [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=937.74s)]
*  care about, like digging their [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=939.1s)]
*  kids out of rubble with their [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=942.1800000000001s)]
*  bare hands. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=943.7800000000001s)]
*  What do you do with all that? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=946.0600000000001s)]
*  Is that is that your argument [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=947.38s)]
*  that the need to retain empathy [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=949.46s)]
*  is that for all of us or is [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=950.7s)]
*  that for those of us who have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=952.74s)]
*  the luxury of being [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=955.04s)]
*  dispassionate at this moment, if [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=956.52s)]
*  I could put it that way? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=958.08s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=959.88s)]
*  I think that I have friends of [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=961.48s)]
*  mine whose family members were [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=965.48s)]
*  abducted by Hamas from their [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=968.2s)]
*  kibbutz and brought to Gaza. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=970.24s)]
*  And my friends have no idea [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=972.32s)]
*  what's happening to them. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=974.48s)]
*  I have friends who are [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=976.48s)]
*  Palestinian whose relatives [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=978.0s)]
*  have experienced unimaginable [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=981.5600000000001s)]
*  things happening to them and [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=984.86s)]
*  their homes over the last [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=986.3s)]
*  several decades. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=987.62s)]
*  People who have been driven [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=989.02s)]
*  from their homes and can never [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=990.1s)]
*  go back. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=991.5s)]
*  And I think there's a tendency [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=993.38s)]
*  and I'm not here to lay blame [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=995.5s)]
*  on the news media exclusively [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=997.26s)]
*  or mostly or anything, but I [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1000.74s)]
*  think there's a tendency to [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1002.02s)]
*  report things in statistics [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1003.66s)]
*  that kind of are hard to grasp [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1006.02s)]
*  our heads around. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1007.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1008.54s)]
*  If we hear stats of X 50 people [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1008.7s)]
*  are killed, 100 people are [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1010.98s)]
*  killed, 500 people killed, it [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1011.98s)]
*  sounds horrible. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1013.3s)]
*  And the numbers that escalate [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1014.04s)]
*  are even more horrible. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1015.8s)]
*  But we don't relate to it as [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1017.0s)]
*  much as an image of a child who [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  survived a bombing and is [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1021.12s)]
*  shell shocked and doesn't know [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1023.9599999999999s)]
*  how to respond. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1025.08s)]
*  We don't respond to it as much [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1026.8s)]
*  as a single case study of a [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1028.36s)]
*  child and that child being in [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1029.8799999999999s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1031.68s)]
*  We don't respond to it as much [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1032.28s)]
*  as seeing a video of a child [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1033.52s)]
*  who lived on a kibbutz finding [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  out that none of his family [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1036.76s)]
*  members survived. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  There's a specific humanity [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1039.6s)]
*  that is awoken in us, stimulated [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1041.86s)]
*  us, locked in us by seeing a [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1044.22s)]
*  single case study of a person. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1046.46s)]
*  And I think great literature [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1049.26s)]
*  does that. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1050.3s)]
*  And I think great news media [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1050.74s)]
*  does that because it allows us [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1052.18s)]
*  to see ourselves in that [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1053.58s)]
*  person, at least at the very [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1055.3s)]
*  least, maybe not understand [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1056.62s)]
*  what they're going through, but [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1058.1399999999999s)]
*  recognize the common humanity [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1059.26s)]
*  and feel empathy. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1061.6599999999999s)]
*  Ben Sheehan, thanks so much for [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1062.8999999999999s)]
*  talking with us today. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1063.98s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxDlUYyXkWU&t=1065.58s)]
