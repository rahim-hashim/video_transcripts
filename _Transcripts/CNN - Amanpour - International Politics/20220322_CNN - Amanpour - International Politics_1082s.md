Video Description: Ordinary citizens often get caught up in the day’s geopolitical drama. Take the recently released Anglo-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, held for six years by Tehran – and the American basketball star Brittney Griner, still in Russia since her detention there before the invasion of Ukraine. Jason Rezaian, while working as a Washington Post correspondent in Tehran, was unjustly imprisoned for 544 days by Iranian authorities.

# Free Brittney: What the US Must Do For Americans Wrongfully Detained Overseas | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4)
*  Too often, ordinary citizens get caught up in the day's geopolitical dramas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=0.0s)]
*  Take the recently released Anglo-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, who was [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=4.8s)]
*  held for six years by Tehran, and the American basketball star Brittany Greiner, who's being [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=8.82s)]
*  detained right now in Russia since its war on Ukraine, rather a little bit before. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=13.92s)]
*  Our next guest has experienced these cruel tactics firsthand. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=18.76s)]
*  Jason Rezaian writes for The Washington Post Global Opinions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And while serving as the paper's correspondent in Tehran, he spent 544 days unjustly imprisoned [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=26.0s)]
*  on trumped up charges by Iranian authorities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=32.28s)]
*  And here he is with Hari Sreenivasan discussing how to help those who are too often used as [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=35.24s)]
*  bargaining chips. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=40.18s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=41.68s)]
*  Jason Rezaian, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=43.8s)]
*  You've got a unique perspective on this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=46.08s)]
*  I want to talk a little bit about Brittany Greiner. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about quite possibly the best basketball player out there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=50.04s)]
*  She's a phenomenal athlete. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=56.76s)]
*  And you wrote recently, Jason, that you are really concerned for her and her detention [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=58.44s)]
*  in Russia. How come? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=64.88s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on, Hari, and asking these questions. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=67.4s)]
*  I think first the red flag for me was that this arrest was announced through Russian [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=72.44s)]
*  media, state media. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=81.56s)]
*  We can call it propaganda. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=83.72s)]
*  I think that's fair to say with a mugshot. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=84.96s)]
*  That announcement through their media was made a couple of weeks after her arrest. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=90.44s)]
*  Then we learned that she was being denied consular access to officials from the US government [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=96.92s)]
*  whose job it is to tend to the needs of Americans in trouble abroad. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=104.0s)]
*  Whether there's any credibility or truth to charges against her, she has those rights. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that those two things were our initial sort of understanding of the situation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  were red flags for me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  I've been following cases of other Americans detained abroad since my own detention in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=124.2s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=131.08s)]
*  And this one leapt out at me as being problematic from the get go. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=132.08s)]
*  So for people who might not understand, why was this WNBA player in Russia in the first [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=140.12s)]
*  place? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=145.88s)]
*  So Brittany Greiner is one of the greatest basketball players of all time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=146.88s)]
*  As you noted, the best or one of the best in the WNBA. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=153.0s)]
*  But many WNBA players have the opportunity to play in a foreign league during the off [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=159.28s)]
*  season do so to earn another income. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=164.92s)]
*  The contracts that we hear about from an NBA or Major League Baseball or NFL, astronomical [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=168.44s)]
*  numbers in the tens of millions are unfortunately not available to WNBA players. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=176.6s)]
*  And so those like Brittany Greiner, who have these immense talents, seek an opportunity [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=184.24s)]
*  to have financial gain. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=191.72s)]
*  And they do in other countries, Russia being one of the leading ones. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=196.2s)]
*  So she's out there, basically a second job to make ends meet, so to speak. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=199.28s)]
*  And to keep playing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=206.04s)]
*  And she's detained in Russia right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=207.28s)]
*  And I wonder if this is just a semantic difference. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=209.4s)]
*  What is the difference between kind of a pretrial detention on whatever charges they think she's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=211.68s)]
*  guilty of versus basically being held hostage? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=216.08s)]
*  I think that there are very subtle differences. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=220.72s)]
*  But when you talk about a pretrial detention in a country like Russia, in a country like [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=224.08s)]
*  Iran, in a country like China, where we know that the judicial processes that a lot of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  people and often usually foreign people go through are not similar to the ones that we [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=237.12s)]
*  know in the West where due process is a right that's guaranteed to all. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=246.04s)]
*  One wonders very quickly, what are the motivations here? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  So to me, as someone who's been through this, the idea of a pretrial detention is more to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=254.64s)]
*  to explain to the Russian public why this superstar is being held for an extended period [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=263.84s)]
*  of time. What is there to investigate? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=270.52s)]
*  Right. She she arrived on an airplane. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=273.0s)]
*  Her bags were searched. There either was a substance in there or there wasn't. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=275.6s)]
*  Why do we need to wait another two months while she's being kept held in communicato, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=280.6s)]
*  unable to speak to representatives of the US government? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  It is very, very fishy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think by keeping it quiet, we haven't done her any favors. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm here for sort of minimizing this, but it seems like these human beings are just [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  pawns in a much larger game. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=302.6s)]
*  This is just table stakes. Well, I've got two of yours. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=305.68s)]
*  You've got two of mine. You want to talk about this? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=307.88s)]
*  Let's get this other thing over with. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=309.72s)]
*  And the higher profile person that I have, maybe it's worth more in my stack of chips. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, again, I don't want to belittle it to a card game, but it just seems like this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  And you know, you've put it very well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=322.0s)]
*  And my my deep concern is that with 40 something Americans being held in this way right [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=325.04s)]
*  now, the State Department is spread very thin in trying to work these cases and and bring [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=330.6s)]
*  people home. What happens when that number becomes 100, 200, 400? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=337.92s)]
*  My concern is that at that point, the US government throws up its hands and says, you know, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  this is not an issue that we can get a handle on. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=350.0s)]
*  Travel beyond our borders at your own risk. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=353.72s)]
*  That that's not the future that I want to live in. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think that that's the direction that we're headed if we don't come to to a consensus [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  with our allies first and then create credible deterrence to the hostage taking nations [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  so that they understand that the cost of doing this is going to be higher than the perceived [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  benefits. You have looked into this and you have created a documentary at The Washington [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=378.12s)]
*  Post, which was fascinating, called Bring Them Home. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  And it looks not the Brittany Grinders case, but you actually look at the case of a single [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  family and and talk about how this is actually happening to multiple people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=392.36s)]
*  We haven't heard from a mod for 12 days. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=398.04s)]
*  You just kind of start. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=403.04s)]
*  Thinking a bunch of stuff. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  And one of the facts that really left out at me was that there are now more Americans [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=410.44s)]
*  being detained by countries or state actors than there are by terrorist organizations. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=415.48s)]
*  And that was just. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=422.04s)]
*  You know, I floored me. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=425.44s)]
*  It's astounding. And I think it's important to note that there are probably thousands of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=427.08s)]
*  Americans being held on credible charges of legal violations in different countries or at [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=432.72s)]
*  least charges that might be credible that are not put into the category of wrongful detainees. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=440.56s)]
*  Wrongful detainees is a determination that the U.S. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=448.56s)]
*  government makes about Americans who are being held by foreign states in in in in situations that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=451.48s)]
*  clearly either are politically motivated or motivated by trying to extract, extract [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=459.76s)]
*  leverages from the United States. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  We identified about 43 of cases of that or four cases of Americans being held by terrorist [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=468.76s)]
*  organizations. It's a stark difference. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  That has shifted over time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=478.04s)]
*  And my colleagues at Washington Post Opinions and I, as we looked at this phenomena through the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=481.44000000000005s)]
*  lens of this individual family, the Sharkey family, whose father, husband, Ahmad Sharkey is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=486.92s)]
*  being held in Iran right now, we started to understand that the U.S. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=493.92s)]
*  government doesn't have a great approach to dealing with this problem. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=499.76000000000005s)]
*  And actually, the U.S. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  government's approach is better than that of, say, the UK, Canada, Australia. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=505.44s)]
*  But it's getting worse and worse. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=512.08s)]
*  There's more and more of these cases happening all the time. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=514.16s)]
*  Well, we've done a pretty good job at putting down hostage taking of organizations like ISIS and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=518.04s)]
*  al Qaeda. We haven't done so well in terms of these foreign adversaries, usually [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=523.88s)]
*  authoritarian governments taking Americans prisoner, putting them through a judicial process [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=532.2s)]
*  that is opaque and not based in the rule of law as we know it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=538.2s)]
*  And so we're trying to shift the conversation and get people to understand that these are not [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=545.04s)]
*  Americans being held for any crimes that they committed. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=550.48s)]
*  They're being held as a tool by a foreign state to try and get something in return from the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=555.28s)]

*  And if we want to save those people from these terrible fates, we're going to have to engage in [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=563.12s)]
*  some kind of negotiations until the time that we have credible deterrence to stop this practice [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=567.88s)]
*  going forward. We don't have those deterrence in place right now. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=574.36s)]
*  There's a scene in the documentary where I think it was a member of Congress who told the Sharkey [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=577.88s)]
*  family, hey, you know, look, I don't think we're going to completely change our entire stance to [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=581.76s)]
*  Iran based on what we, you know, we obviously want your husband back. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=587.76s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing here, but that sort of clarity is rarely out in the open. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=592.12s)]
*  I mean, what you hear from the State Department and other we are trying our hardest. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=597.96s)]
*  We're doing everything we can. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=602.9200000000001s)]
*  But hey, guess what? There's this elephant in the room that we can't ignore. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=605.08s)]
*  I want to acknowledge that that was Congressman Ted Deutch from Florida, who has been one of the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=608.76s)]
*  most vocal and committed advocates for hostage families because one of his constituents, Bob [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=613.88s)]
*  Levinson, a former FBI agent, was abducted in Iran and never heard from again. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=620.12s)]
*  Trump administration announced that it had intelligence that he had died while in Iranian custody [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=627.84s)]
*  in 2020. But, you know, the fact of the matter is very few representatives want to engage in these [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=634.04s)]
*  conversations. The fact that Congressman Deutch would be so honest and upfront about the challenges [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=642.08s)]
*  of it is admirable. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  And it also speaks to the kind of. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=651.64s)]
*  Very difficult calculations that the government has to make. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, though, if citizens can condition and freedom and safety are a concern until we find ways [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=660.2s)]
*  to make this less attractive, it's going to keep happening and we're going to have to give some kind of [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=670.16s)]
*  concessions to get people out. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=678.32s)]
*  Historically, since the Nixon administration, the US government has had a policy of no concessions, but that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=680.4s)]
*  policy has been flouted on dozens of occasions in instances where the political cost here at home became too [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=687.04s)]
*  high to not freeing someone. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=696.24s)]
*  You can see it in the UK right now in their freeing of Nazanin Zagari Radcliffe and Amishé Oshiri. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=699.36s)]
*  Those families had raised the cases of their loved ones for years until finally it came to a breaking point. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=706.48s)]
*  But in the process, they left other Britons behind. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=716.24s)]
*  This is a really treacherous business and one that while the US government, the UK government, the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=720.52s)]
*  Canadian government, the Australian government, Western European governments, they're not responsible for the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=728.76s)]
*  hostage takings that these authoritarians are doing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=734.36s)]
*  But they are responsible for the safety, well-being and freedom of their own citizens. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=737.72s)]
*  That's what governments are for. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=743.0s)]
*  What kinds of disincentives can the United States government impose on a hostage taking or detaining [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=744.84s)]
*  nation? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=752.6s)]
*  I mean, who do you penalize and who do you make life difficult for where they have an incentive to say, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=753.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, we should probably let him out? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=760.6s)]
*  We have, first of all, the global Magnitsky sanctions, which are part of international law now, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=763.64s)]
*  sanctions that are targeted to individuals who are human rights violators and terrorism perpetrators. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=770.9200000000001s)]
*  Hostage taking is one of those crimes by which you can go after officials of states who are involved in [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  these events. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=788.2800000000001s)]
*  You can seize their assets internationally. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=790.5200000000001s)]
*  You can put red cards out for their arrest internationally. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=793.4000000000001s)]
*  You can try them in international courts if they are detained. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=796.36s)]
*  That's one. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=802.2800000000001s)]
*  Another is freezing assets of governments and placing new sanctions on economies. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=803.56s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of blanket sanctions on entire nations and their economies because from experience [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=809.56s)]
*  I've seen that they almost always hurt normal people more than they do the perpetrators of these [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=817.4799999999999s)]
*  crimes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=825.7199999999999s)]
*  But ultimately, it's going to keep happening until we have those measures in place and those [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=827.0s)]
*  measures are shared by like-minded governments. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=833.08s)]
*  We all have to come together and say, hey, you know what? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  This is not going to stand on our watch. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=839.24s)]
*  Right now in the negotiations between Iran and world powers, every single one of the Western [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=841.96s)]
*  countries, the United States, the UK, France, and Germany, along with Austria, the host nation [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=848.36s)]
*  of the JCPOA talks, have citizens being held hostage in Iran right now. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=855.16s)]
*  I think it's a very compelling argument to say, Iran, we're not going to talk about lifting [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=861.4s)]
*  these sanctions until you clear the decks, free all these people, and stop this practice [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  moving forward. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=870.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, those governments have not come together and made that decision that they're [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=871.48s)]
*  going to take that unified front. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=876.36s)]
*  For that reason, I'm worried that we're going to see a new spate of Iranian hostage taking [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  in the not so distant future. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=884.28s)]
*  I cannot imagine any world in where, for example, if this was Steph Curry, if this was LeBron, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=886.6s)]
*  that it wouldn't be on every newspaper above the fold every day for the entire time that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=896.36s)]
*  Britney Grande has been gone. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=903.56s)]
*  I agree with you 100%. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=905.8s)]
*  I think the truth is, if you look at my case, the Washington Post [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=908.12s)]
*  made it a matter of public record and kept a count on their website and in the print [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=914.04s)]
*  edition, writing stories about me, the same argument could be made. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=921.9599999999999s)]
*  Maybe somebody worked at a smaller regional or local paper and was abducted in another [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=926.28s)]
*  country. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=931.7199999999999s)]
*  Are they going to get the same attention? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=932.04s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=933.9599999999999s)]
*  All the more reason for me and people who have an understanding of what's at stake here [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=935.0s)]
*  and what is likely actually happening in the supposed case against her. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=941.4s)]
*  All the more reason for us to be waving our arms and trying to shine a spotlight on it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=947.88s)]
*  I think that ultimately, my great hope is that Britney comes home very soon and that I have a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=953.72s)]
*  chance to meet her and talk to her in the cases of others, Americans who've been held wrongfully [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=961.24s)]
*  hostage by other governments. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=970.2s)]
*  I never had one that I met after the fact that I reported on say, I wish you'd been quiet on [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=972.5200000000001s)]
*  my case. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=977.48s)]
*  Did you think that people did not care about you on the outside? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=978.76s)]
*  Were you told that? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=981.48s)]
*  I was told that for weeks while I was being held in solitary confinement. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=983.08s)]
*  The Iranian, my interrogator said that the Iranian state media had announced that my [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=988.6800000000001s)]

*  I had no way of knowing if that was true or not. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=997.4s)]
*  They were also saying that I had access to legal representation, which was certainly not true. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1001.88s)]
*  I didn't see a lawyer for the first nine months of my detention. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1008.04s)]
*  The first days are ones of confusion. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1015.16s)]
*  Then that confusion becomes terror. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1018.68s)]
*  You wonder if you're ever going to see the light of day again. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1023.0s)]
*  You wonder if you're going to be executed. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1027.0s)]
*  Then as time drags on, you wonder if you're going to die in prison. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1029.96s)]
*  Your fears, your apprehensions, your anxieties shift multiple times during one of these ordeals. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1036.36s)]
*  In every single way, it's inhumane and it's torture. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1045.48s)]
*  To create those circumstances by which captors are trying to really make the detainee go mad. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA_1O0fTQK4&t=1050.6s)]
