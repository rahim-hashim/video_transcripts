Video Description: Ukraine is braced for what could be the decisive battle in this brutal war: the battle for Kherson. As Ukrainian forces advance toward the city, Russia’s defense minister is ordering troop withdrawals from parts of the region, in what would seem to be a major setback for Putin’s war aims. But Ukrainian officials are expressing skepticism and caution in light of a visit to Iran by the Kremlin’s top security adviser. Western officials say he is there in search of more advanced weapons. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky wants to ensure a continuation of international support for his country’s defense, particularly from the U.S. in the wake of the midterms. At this critical time, Christiane sat down with the president and his wife, First Lady Olena Zelenska, for a global exclusive.

# GLOBAL EXCLUSIVE: Christiane Interviews Volodmyr Zelensky and Olena Zelenska | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [November 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ)
*  You asked whether I thought this war would last so long. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  No, because I didn't start this war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And I'm sure there isn't a single Ukrainian who knew what this will be and what tragedy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=8.72s)]
*  this would bring to every home in our country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=17.28s)]
*  Because I'll repeat, we did not start this war, but Ukrainian society united and showed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=20.48s)]
*  that it was ready for what unfortunately was such a tragedy, showed that it was ready for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=27.4s)]
*  these challenges. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=34.64s)]
*  I was really impressed by the power of one nation and was impressed by the swiftness [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=36.68s)]
*  of the response of Europe, the whole world and the whole international community that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=42.56s)]
*  rallied around Ukraine for this challenge. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=48.0s)]
*  First Lady, what motivates you to get up in the morning? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=52.64s)]
*  How do you feel that you've endured this war? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  It's a big question. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=61.44s)]
*  It covers many spheres of my life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=62.44s)]
*  And what helps me get up in the morning, surely, as you said, is my husband's example. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  I know that if he endures, then I have to endure. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=69.64s)]
*  If the day has begun, then we have to keep fighting. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=73.8s)]
*  That keeps me going. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=76.92s)]
*  It's not easy every day, but you know you need to keep running. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=78.72s)]
*  You cannot stop. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=83.12s)]
*  As Alice has said, in order to stay in place, you have to run even faster. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=84.44s)]
*  That's why we run. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=89.64s)]
*  And I get some inspiration from the kids, from the children. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  First and foremost, there are some ordinary things that every family is doing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=95.04s)]
*  You need to get your son ready for school. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=100.28s)]
*  You need to make sure he has had breakfast. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=102.44s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, I don't have the assurance that my child would go to school every day [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  because of those strikes with missiles and drones. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=110.76s)]
*  There's a lot of work, a lot of humanitarian projects that we will continue after the war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=114.4s)]
*  That helps a lot. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns-jNjIccvQ&t=120.36s)]
