*  I'm in Kiev. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm actually in the metro [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=33.0s)]

*  bombardments of the city. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=43.0s)]

*  and also get a sense of what it's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=49.0s)]
*  like for so many people in Kiev [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=50.0s)]
*  who are facing night after night [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=53.0s)]
*  of bombardment and many of whom [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=54.0s)]
*  are hiding out in metro [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=56.0s)]
*  stations which function as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=57.0s)]
*  impromptu bomb shelters. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=58.0s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=59.0s)]
*  that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=60.0s)]
*  Like, how are people? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=62.0s)]
*  Well, let me scan like a little [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=63.0s)]
*  bit and you'll see just the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=64.0s)]
*  station and the train here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=65.0s)]
*  Every night when curfew starts [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=68.0s)]
*  at 8 p.m., the train stations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=71.0s)]
*  fill up, the metro stations fill [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=74.0s)]
*  up with people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=75.0s)]
*  Most people tonight actually [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=76.0s)]
*  are sleeping inside the train [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=77.0s)]
*  wagon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=79.0s)]
*  It's a little bit warmer in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=80.0s)]
*  there than it is on the cold [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=81.0s)]
*  concrete, and it's a little bit [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=82.0s)]
*  warmer in the city. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=83.0s)]
*  So it's a little bit warmer in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=84.0s)]
*  the city. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=85.0s)]
*  It's a little bit warmer in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=86.0s)]
*  there than it is on the cold [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=87.0s)]
*  concrete platform. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=88.0s)]
*  Many people have bomb shelters [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=89.0s)]
*  under their apartment blocks in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=91.0s)]
*  their neighborhoods. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=94.0s)]
*  But for those who don't or want [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=95.0s)]
*  the safety of being deeper [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=96.0s)]
*  underground and with other [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=97.0s)]
*  people, they come to the metro [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=98.0s)]
*  stations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=100.0s)]
*  There are dozens of metro [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=101.0s)]
*  stations like this all across [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=102.0s)]
*  the city every night are filling [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=103.0s)]
*  up with families who are coming [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=104.0s)]
*  to try and get a safe place to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=106.0s)]
*  hide out from the regular [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=107.0s)]
*  artillery and bombing and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=109.0s)]
*  missile attacks facing not just [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=111.0s)]
*  Kiev but a number of Ukrainian [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=113.0s)]
*  cities just about every day now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=115.0s)]
*  Is the bombing happening mainly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=116.0s)]
*  at night or is it all day long? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=118.0s)]
*  There was a big one that went [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=120.0s)]
*  off this afternoon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=122.0s)]
*  In fact, I saw it from the hotel [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=123.0s)]
*  we were staying until we came to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=125.0s)]
*  the metro. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=126.0s)]
*  A big cloud of black smoke [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=127.0s)]
*  erupted at around four or five [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=128.0s)]
*  this afternoon, and that was the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=130.0s)]
*  TV tower, the central TV tower [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=132.0s)]
*  in Kiev had been attacked by [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=134.0s)]
*  Russian airstrikes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=136.0s)]
*  But yes, in general, the missile [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=138.0s)]
*  strikes and bomb strikes do [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=140.0s)]
*  tend to occur at night. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=143.0s)]
*  I mean, you hear the sirens going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=145.0s)]
*  off all throughout the day in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=146.0s)]
*  Kiev and anytime you're anywhere [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=147.0s)]
*  around towns. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=149.0s)]
*  At any moment, you can hear the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=150.0s)]
*  air raid siren and people do [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=151.0s)]
*  generally try and hustle into a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=152.0s)]
*  building, into a basement or bomb [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=154.0s)]
*  shelter if they can find one. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=156.0s)]
*  But it seems like most of the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=157.0s)]
*  missile attacks and bomb attacks [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=158.0s)]
*  are happening at night. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=159.0s)]
*  That's a separate question from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=162.0s)]
*  when, whether it's tank or armor, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=163.0s)]
*  small arms, infantry battles are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=168.0s)]
*  happening, that happens to a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=169.0s)]
*  different schedule. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=171.0s)]
*  But in terms of the aerial [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=172.0s)]
*  bombardment, that does seem to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=173.0s)]
*  be a nighttime activity. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=174.0s)]
*  How would you describe the mood [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=177.0s)]
*  there? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=179.0s)]
*  I mean, I think many people, you [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=180.0s)]
*  know, most people have never [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=182.0s)]
*  lived through this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=183.0s)]
*  I mean, some people throughout [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=184.0s)]
*  the world have lived through [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=186.0s)]
*  this, but most people in the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=187.0s)]
*  West have not, frankly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, the most [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=190.0s)]
*  remarkable thing about Kiev is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=191.0s)]
*  until a week ago, what an [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=192.0s)]
*  absolutely recognizable European [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=194.0s)]
*  cosmopolitan city it was. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=196.0s)]
*  I've been here for about three [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=197.0s)]
*  weeks, and the first two weeks [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=198.0s)]
*  of my time here, I spent my [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=200.0s)]
*  evenings going out to wonderful [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=201.0s)]
*  stylish, delicious restaurants [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=203.0s)]
*  with friends, enjoying the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=205.0s)]
*  atmosphere of a European capital. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=207.0s)]
*  And it's been remarkable how [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=209.0s)]
*  quickly that's all changed and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=211.0s)]
*  how dramatically that's changed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=212.0s)]
*  A lot of people have left the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=214.0s)]
*  city. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=215.0s)]
*  A lot of people left even before [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=216.0s)]
*  Russia invaded on the 24th as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=218.0s)]
*  U.S. intelligence and others [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=220.0s)]
*  started to warn about the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=222.0s)]
*  inevitability of that war. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=224.0s)]
*  Of course, there was a big [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=225.0s)]
*  exodus on the 24th when Russia [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=226.0s)]
*  began its invasion. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=228.0s)]
*  And my friend who's here in the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=229.0s)]
*  metro has told me that the crowd [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=230.0s)]
*  has even thinned out over the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=232.0s)]
*  past five days. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=233.0s)]
*  There's some people who didn't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=234.0s)]
*  manage to leave before the war [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=235.0s)]
*  and the first day or two of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=237.0s)]
*  war have now managed to find a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=238.0s)]
*  way out of the city. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=240.0s)]
*  So the city's definitely thinned [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=241.0s)]
*  out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=242.0s)]
*  It's really a ghost town, in [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=243.0s)]
*  fact, if you walk around the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=244.0s)]
*  streets during the day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=245.0s)]
*  But that's because most people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=246.0s)]
*  who've stayed, and of course, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=248.0s)]
*  the vast majority of people in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=250.0s)]
*  Kiev still have stayed. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=251.0s)]
*  It's a city of a number of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=252.0s)]
*  million people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=253.0s)]
*  So people are very much still [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=255.0s)]
*  here, but they're at their homes [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=256.0s)]
*  and their apartments trying not [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=257.0s)]
*  to go outside, only going outside [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=258.0s)]
*  to go to the grocery store once [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=260.0s)]
*  every few days. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=262.0s)]
*  But the lines for the grocery [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=263.0s)]
*  store, if you can find one [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=264.0s)]
*  that's open or around the block, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=265.0s)]
*  we were at a grocery store the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=267.0s)]
*  other day where people said [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=268.0s)]
*  they'd been waiting for two and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=269.0s)]
*  a half hours and they weren't [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=270.0s)]
*  even close to the front of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=271.0s)]
*  line. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=273.0s)]
*  My friend here, who's a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=274.0s)]
*  journalist, hasn't been able to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=275.0s)]
*  really cover much of this war [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=277.0s)]
*  and instead has just been [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=278.0s)]
*  involved in trying to solve the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=279.0s)]
*  most elemental questions of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=281.0s)]
*  survival for her and her mother [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=282.0s)]
*  how to get food. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=284.0s)]
*  How to come in and out of the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=285.0s)]
*  metro where they've been [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=286.0s)]
*  sleeping for safety, when to go [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=287.0s)]
*  home to take a shower, when to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=289.0s)]
*  go home to buy food, to cook [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=290.0s)]
*  food, to bring it back to the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=292.0s)]
*  metro. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=293.0s)]
*  So people are just trying to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=294.0s)]
*  make it through the day really [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=296.0s)]
*  and trying to stay safe and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=297.0s)]
*  trying to keep their family [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=298.0s)]
*  safe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=299.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the number one [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=300.0s)]
*  concern for most people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=301.0s)]
*  And there's also, I'd say, a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=302.0s)]
*  mix of real pride in how the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=304.0s)]
*  Ukrainian state and Ukrainian [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=307.0s)]
*  military has been able to hold [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=308.0s)]
*  off the Russian invasion. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=309.0s)]
*  For the last five days, it seems [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=313.0s)]
*  like at least the Russian [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=315.0s)]
*  calculation was that Kiev would [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=317.0s)]
*  fall in a matter of days, and it [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=319.0s)]
*  hasn't. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=320.0s)]
*  There are Ukrainian cities [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=321.0s)]
*  falling and the Russian troops [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=322.0s)]
*  are moving deeper and deeper into [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=324.0s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=327.0s)]
*  But nonetheless, the Ukrainian [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=328.0s)]
*  military has held them off in a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=330.0s)]
*  way I think that no one [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=331.0s)]
*  expected. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=332.0s)]
*  So there's a real pride and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=333.0s)]
*  energy, people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=334.0s)]
*  But at the same time, there's a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=335.0s)]
*  real trepidation, a knowledge [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=336.0s)]
*  that perhaps that can't last [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=337.0s)]
*  forever. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=338.0s)]
*  That nonetheless, Russia has [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=339.0s)]
*  such a force, that it's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=340.0s)]
*  a formidable military machine [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=341.0s)]
*  that the Ukrainian military for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=342.0s)]
*  all of its success, skill, and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=343.0s)]
*  bravery might not be able to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=344.0s)]
*  hold them off forever. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=345.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=346.0s)]
*  understandable anxiety about [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=347.0s)]
*  that and uncertainty. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=348.0s)]
*  There's one young woman here in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=349.0s)]
*  the metro tonight in Kiev whose [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=350.0s)]
*  family is living in the Ukrainian [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=351.0s)]
*  city of Kherson in the south. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=352.0s)]
*  It's near Crimea. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=353.0s)]
*  And Kherson just today was [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=354.0s)]
*  captured by Russia there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=355.0s)]
*  Now Russian troops walking [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=356.0s)]
*  through her home in the city of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=357.0s)]
*  Kherson. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=358.0s)]
*  And it's a very, very [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=359.0s)]
*  important place to be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=360.0s)]
*  And I think that's the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=361.0s)]
*  biggest concern for the Ukrainian [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=362.0s)]
*  military. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=363.0s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=364.0s)]
*  concern for the Ukrainian [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=365.0s)]
*  military. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=366.0s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=367.0s)]
*  concern for the Ukrainian [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=368.0s)]
*  military. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=369.0s)]
*  Her hometown, her parents look [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=371.0s)]
*  out their window and saw Russian [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=372.0s)]
*  tanks in the streets. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=373.0s)]
*  And so that, of course, has her [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=374.0s)]
*  wracked with fear and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=375.0s)]
*  uncertainty about what comes [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=376.0s)]
*  next. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=377.0s)]
*  Will she be able to go home? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=378.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=379.0s)]
*  Will she be able to see her [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=380.0s)]
*  parents? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=381.0s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=382.0s)]
*  Will they be able to get to see [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=383.0s)]
*  her? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=384.0s)]
*  So, of course, there's a lot of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=385.0s)]
*  uncertainty and fear, which is, I [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=386.0s)]
*  think, completely [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=387.0s)]
*  understandable given the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=388.0s)]
*  circumstances of what Ukraine is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=389.0s)]
*  living through at the moment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=390.0s)]
*  I just did want to ask if [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=392.0s)]
*  anybody's angry. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=393.0s)]
*  Did they feel that they were [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=394.0s)]
*  ill-prepared, because you're not [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=395.0s)]
*  the only person who's mentioned [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=397.0s)]
*  that just a couple of weeks ago [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=398.0s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago, people were going to cafes and living their normal 21st century [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=399.0s)]
*  life and then all of a sudden this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=404.08s)]
*  I'm just wondering if anybody feels angry that they feel like they should have been [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=405.88s)]
*  better prepared for this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=409.0s)]
*  The anger that I get is an incredible amount of anger toward Russia and toward Putin. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=411.24s)]
*  I mean, just the amount of vitriolic fury that I've heard toward Russia has really [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=415.92s)]
*  been remarkable. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=421.56s)]
*  Remarkable because it calls into question what is in fact Putin's plan here? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=423.96s)]
*  What's the kind of political endgame to this military campaign? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=428.68s)]
*  The idea, presumably, if we just go by both Putin's statements and the way that he's put [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=432.2s)]
*  his military into battle, clearly with the intention of capturing Kiev, there's some [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  idea that Russia would take over at least some portion of the Ukrainian state and install [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=440.52s)]
*  its own pro-Russian government and have a kind of client state here in Ukraine. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  But I don't know how that works. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=453.2s)]
*  Given the degree and depth and scale of anger here and how I've heard that from so many [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=454.64s)]
*  different people representing so many different generations, segments of society, and it's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=460.52s)]
*  so deep at this point, the way that Russia has really lost Ukraine, a country that I've [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=465.28s)]
*  been coming to for 10 years and 10 years ago, you had a lot of interest, sympathy, connection [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=471.36s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=476.88s)]
*  People felt close to Russia. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=477.88s)]
*  There is, of course, a lot of shared history. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=478.88s)]
*  Many people in Ukraine, many people in Kiev speak Russian. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  They speak Russian at home. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=483.08s)]
*  They speak Russian with their children, to their friends. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=484.52s)]
*  The degree to which Russia has managed to turn Ukrainians against them, I think, for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=488.03999999999996s)]
*  a generation at least, is really, really dramatic. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=493.84s)]
*  So when we talk about anger, it's 99% directed at Russia and maybe 1% directed at the West, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=496.84s)]
*  at NATO, at the United States, Europe, countries that Ukrainians feel like aren't supporting [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  them enough in their struggle, in their battle, which they really feel like they are at the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=511.42s)]
*  front lines of a fight with Putin over the future of Europe or the future of the democratic [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=514.66s)]
*  project and its survival. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=520.62s)]
*  They feel like they're fighting that battle and they would like to see more support from [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=522.54s)]
*  the West. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=526.98s)]
*  As to anger or frustration with their president, Volodymyr Zelensky, other Ukrainian politicians [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=527.98s)]
*  who indeed up until the final days before the invasion were downplaying the likelihood [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=534.18s)]
*  of it, interestingly, no, I don't sense a lot of that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=538.26s)]
*  And I just anecdotally have picked up a real sense of unification and purpose and patriotism [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=542.0999999999999s)]
*  among Ukrainians. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm wondering what people are telling you about how they plan to proceed if the Russians [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  do take the capital. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=556.5s)]
*  Do they plan to resist? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=557.9s)]
*  Indeed, the prospects are horrifying, especially if fighting comes to the center of Kiev, because [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=559.38s)]
*  I'm convinced just from talking to people around town over the past weeks that people [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=565.9799999999999s)]
*  in Kiev will not give up easily, even if Russian forces enter the city, even if Russian forces [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=571.78s)]
*  are able to capture the seat of government, take Zelensky, depose him from power. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=576.78s)]
*  I don't think the residents of the city will necessarily just go along with that and so [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=581.34s)]
*  readily agree to live under a new Russian regime. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=586.02s)]
*  And that makes me question how this all ends and can this all end. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=590.58s)]
*  And I think we could see is really protracted and horrific. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=593.94s)]
*  I think there's a lot of street fighting that could go on for some time. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=598.7s)]
*  I don't know how else Russia is able to take the city. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=601.7s)]
*  It may be able to capture some of the key strategic sites just with using sheer overwhelming [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=607.7s)]
*  military force. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=612.7s)]
*  But how does it actually occupy effectively a city of many millions of people in the long [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=613.7s)]
*  run? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=621.7s)]
*  Just to talk with people in Kiev over these days, I just don't see that being not just [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=622.7s)]
*  a easy but maybe even realistic task for Russia, given the degree of animosity and anger and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  readiness to resist. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=632.58s)]
*  You see people all around town. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=634.94s)]
*  It could be actually quite scary and unnerving. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=635.94s)]
*  You see people around town, regular people carrying Kalashnikov rifles. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=637.94s)]
*  There's been a program to distribute guns to regular citizens trying to defend their [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=642.58s)]
*  neighborhoods. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=647.3000000000001s)]
*  You see a lot of local self-defense groups who've put up checkpoints, who've put together [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  concrete blocks, sandbags, tires to protect their neighborhoods. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=651.7s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that looks to me like a fight that could go on for a really [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=656.9s)]
*  long time and have a really high cost. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=659.9s)]
*  We're calling the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia that began in Belarus. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=662.42s)]
*  I don't know exactly what the tenor of those negotiations is. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=667.78s)]
*  I'm interested if people know about that and what do they think about that? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=673.42s)]
*  Do they feel that there's anything hopeful about it? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=677.38s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=683.5799999999999s)]
*  People are paying a lot of attention to negotiations because I think that there's an idea among [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=684.86s)]
*  many Ukrainians that they know at the end of the day Russia has military advantage, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=688.1s)]
*  that if it's just a pure military fight, that sooner or later Russia will emerge with the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=692.5s)]
*  upper hand just because it has such overwhelming firepower. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=696.5s)]
*  But if the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian public can hold out, the longer this goes [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=700.5s)]
*  on and the less this resembles the kind of quick, easy victory that Putin seems to have [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=705.22s)]
*  initially wanted or counted on, the better that Ukraine's negotiating position begins. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=711.1s)]
*  Will Putin be interested or feel compelled to sue for peace as it were? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=716.38s)]
*  I think that the odds of that are actually not minuscule. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=722.5400000000001s)]
*  As the cost of this invasion go up economically and therefore perhaps also politically for [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=726.14s)]
*  Putin back in Moscow, Ukrainians are aware of that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=730.1s)]
*  Ukrainians are looking at what are those Western sanctions? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=734.46s)]
*  What's the US dollar to ruble exchange rate to see how much that's fallen in recent days? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=736.7s)]
*  People here are really paying attention to what's the cost that Russia is paying for [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=741.7s)]
*  this war? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=745.0200000000001s)]
*  As those costs mount day after day, does that mean Russia might be more willing to go for [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=746.62s)]
*  some sort of negotiated solution? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=751.0200000000001s)]
*  However, for now, hollow or at least without great result, this negotiation process has [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=752.62s)]
*  been on the border with Belarus. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=758.1400000000001s)]
*  People are paying attention. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=760.58s)]
*  You wonder how much information the Russian public is getting about this. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  It's very obvious that Putin has waged this very aggressive sort of propaganda campaign [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=766.1s)]
*  sort of leading up to this. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=770.3000000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you have any sense of whether the Russian people are buying it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=772.5400000000001s)]
*  It's hard to tell because the Kremlin has become so skilled at controlling and having [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=777.62s)]
*  almost monopoly on the information space. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=782.9s)]
*  Just tonight as I was here in the Kiev Metro, also like everybody else on my phone trying [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=785.3000000000001s)]
*  to follow the news, the news I saw coming out of Moscow is that the Kremlin has taken [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=789.5s)]
*  off the airwaves Echo of Moscow and TV Dozh. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=794.94s)]
*  Echo of Moscow is a really storied independent radio station, but it's also a website. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=797.9s)]
*  Dozh or TV Rain is the really best, if not only, independent television station left [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=803.54s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=810.5s)]
*  Both of those outlets were just taken off the air today. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=811.5s)]
*  That just shows how much this war in Ukraine is also really a war back at home by Putin [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=814.14s)]
*  against anyone, any institution or individual who would question not just this war, but [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=821.62s)]
*  really the nature of his rule. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=826.46s)]
*  So with that kind of domination or monopoly of the information space, the Kremlin has [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=828.5s)]
*  been able to sell this war to the Russian public as essentially a war of necessity, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=833.18s)]
*  to defend Russia against NATO, against the United States. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=839.18s)]
*  It was to convince Russian people that it was in fact Ukraine that was waging a war [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=843.1s)]
*  against Russian speaking people in the Donbas. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=848.1s)]
*  These are all the narratives you see on Russian state television. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=850.5s)]
*  It's hard to tell how much they're working or not. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=853.38s)]
*  I think it's really illustrative, for example, that although there have been spontaneous [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=855.82s)]
*  anti-war demonstrations that have broken out in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=860.5s)]
*  this time, unlike in other previous events, the Kremlin has not even tried to put together [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=864.5s)]
*  a kind of pro-Putin, pro-Kremlin, I don't know what you call it, pro-war rally. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=869.34s)]
*  But these are the sort of events that before the Kremlin has tried to stage, kind of counter [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=875.22s)]
*  protests where they bus in state workers, put on a big show and make it look like 50,000 [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=879.0999999999999s)]
*  people in a stadium support Putin and his policies. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=883.6199999999999s)]
*  The fact that they haven't even gone for that here, I think, is telling and that they know [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=886.5799999999999s)]
*  there really isn't a deep wellspring of support for this war in Russia, that it's dangerous [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=891.0999999999999s)]
*  to tell the Russian people too much about this war. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=896.54s)]
*  Because I think deep down, it's very confusing and even distasteful for most Russians to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=898.66s)]
*  think of Russian soldiers firing on Ukrainians. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=903.66s)]
*  It's like a thought that I think is disturbing for most Russians and the Kremlin is doing [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=906.14s)]
*  all it can to keep that thought or keep that awareness from reaching the Russian people [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  at all. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=915.78s)]
*  Before we let you go, Joshua, what is the thing that you would most want us to take [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=916.78s)]
*  away from our conversation with you today? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=919.5s)]
*  Really just the way that war is so transformative. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=923.74s)]
*  And this sounds kind of banal or obvious, but maybe I didn't quite understand it until [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=925.82s)]
*  I ended up in the middle of one myself. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=931.02s)]
*  I was at a children's hospital this week where not just children who had been injured in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=933.5s)]
*  bombing and artillery attacks were being treated. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=940.02s)]
*  That was horrific and painful to watch. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=942.0999999999999s)]
*  But there were whole wards of children who have cancer, heart ailments, neurological [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=945.5799999999999s)]
*  diseases, many of whom have been waiting and came to Kiev from other parts of Ukraine for [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=951.42s)]
*  treatment or surgery, who are now living in the dank, moldy basement of the hospital [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=957.26s)]
*  because it's too dangerous to live in the wards above ground. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=966.3s)]
*  And any prospect of them getting the care they need in any time in the near future is [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=970.18s)]
*  completely made impossible. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=974.66s)]
*  And that's an aspect of war I hadn't even begun to think about. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=977.06s)]
*  Right. And there are just stories like that a million times over across the city and across [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=980.3s)]
*  Ukraine these days. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=985.34s)]
*  Joshua, thank you so much for sharing this reporting with us. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=986.98s)]
*  And of course, we wish you and your friends the best. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=990.38s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=993.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WLD_7AM8IE&t=995.0600000000001s)]
