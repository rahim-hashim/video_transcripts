# The Border Crisis From the Perspective of a Former Patrol Agent  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [December 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE)
*  So on the topic of human rights, we turn next to the US-Mexico border crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=0.0s)]
*  Francisco Cantu is a third-generation Mexican-American and a former border patrol agent, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=5.24s)]
*  an unlikely pairing perhaps driven by his thirst to understand the issue from both sides of the fence, so to speak. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=11.28s)]
*  His new book, The Line Becomes a River, Dispatches from the Border, chronicles the brutality along the landscape he loves. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=17.76s)]
*  And he shared the stories of the people that he met along the way with Ahari Srinivasan. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=25.8s)]
*  Now, you didn't become a border patrol agent to write this book. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=32.04s)]
*  You had an international policy degree. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=35.04s)]
*  You said you wanted to see how the world works. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=39.18s)]
*  You wanted to see where this policy actually, the rubber meets the road. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=41.18s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=45.38s)]
*  I think there was a lot of naivete behind the decision. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=46.58s)]
*  I sort of imagined that I could join the border patrol and do this work for a few years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=49.82s)]
*  And then sort of leave with all these answers to this big complex problem because I had seen it from a perspective that probably not a lot of policymakers have seen it from. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=55.66s)]
*  But of course, you know, the, I think I also massively underestimated, you know, the power of the institution to sort of bend people's purposes towards its will. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=68.38s)]
*  And so, you know, going through the Border Patrol Academy, it's much like any military or law enforcement training where it's sort of designed to break down your idea of who you are as an individual and rebuild you in the image of a law enforcement agent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=80.06s)]
*  One of the things that you mentioned is living near the border means becoming conditioned to a degree of militarization and surveillance that would cause great alarm in any other part of the country. Explain that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  You can't drive longer than like 30 to 40 minutes in any direction along the border without going through a border patrol checkpoint and being stopped in your car. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=104.14s)]
*  And of course, you know, racial profiling is something that, you know, you are you are taught not to do at the Academy from this, you know, like, by the books standpoint. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=114.58s)]
*  But it's really ingrained in people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=125.18s)]
*  And I think that the the Border Patrol training does very little to, you know, to actually prevent it happening in in action at the moment. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=128.42s)]
*  It's a very militarized space. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=138.5s)]
*  And I think that that militarization, it's not just border patrol checkpoints. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=140.26s)]
*  It's also, you know, fencing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=144.74s)]
*  The newest thing down in Nogales, which is the closest border town to where I live in Tucson, is since the midterm election, there has been all these coils of concertina wire, razor wire that you would see, you know, around a prison. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=146.9s)]
*  And so when you get out of your car to go walk across the border, I mean, you really feel that you were, you know, in in a dangerous place. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=160.74s)]
*  And and, you know, the border is actually not any more dangerous than America's large cities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=171.9s)]
*  Right. El Paso is sort of famously one of America's safest cities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=179.34s)]
*  What were your notions of what are what's good, what's bad? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=184.78s)]
*  Were those challenged? Did that change? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=188.38s)]
*  Did you start to accept something that you might have thought was unacceptable? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=190.62s)]
*  You have people that get lost out in the desert and they get left behind by their groups. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=197.58s)]
*  And then they just try to walk out to a road or to a village to get picked up. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  They say, you know, like, just just take us home. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=210.34s)]
*  We're lost. We've been out here without food or water for days. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=213.38000000000002s)]
*  And so I encountered a husband and a wife who were in that situation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=215.62s)]
*  And I showed up as like, you know, the junior agent who was assigned basically just to like shuttle people back and forth from the station. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=220.78s)]
*  And as I was having a conversation with these people, because I could speak Spanish, I was talking with a husband and he said, you know, my wife, she speaks fluent English. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=228.1s)]
*  She she grew up in Iowa. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=237.1s)]
*  And then all of a sudden I was having this conversation in English with this woman and she said, yeah, I was a kindergarten teacher. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=239.74s)]
*  I went home because a family member died and she was pregnant. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=247.18s)]
*  And she said that she was crossing the border because she wanted to have her child here because she wanted her child to grow up like she had grown up in the United States with access to all the freedoms and privileges that she had had. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=254.62s)]
*  And I made a really big effort to remember their names. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=267.82s)]
*  I asked them their names. I introduced myself, you know, because there was the feeling that you had an exchange that was outside of the normal exchange that you might have in those roles of enforcer. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=272.42s)]
*  But ultimately, you had to take them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=285.22s)]
*  Right. Of course. And, you know, her husband asked me if I could do them a favor and just bring them down to the border and let them go without putting them through the court system and, you know, bringing them back to the station like as a brother. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=287.22s)]
*  Right. As a Spanish speaking person, you know, who knows our culture and is from the same background. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=301.3s)]
*  Can you take us? And, of course, you know, I said, no, I can't do that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=308.18s)]
*  I have to take you in. And, you know, I remember just a few hours after that encounter, like after dropping them off, sitting in my car and trying to remember their names. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=314.1s)]
*  And I had already forgotten it, you know, in that short amount of time. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=326.98s)]
*  These small forms of dehumanization, right, like forgetting someone's name is the first act in dehumanizing them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=330.42s)]
*  And I think on a much larger scale, when you look at the media coverage around immigration, immigrants are always represented as this indistinguishable mass of people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=337.38s)]
*  Right. That's threatening the nation or that's surging and overflowing at our borders. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=346.62s)]
*  You point out that in your view that the desert has been weaponized against migrants. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=351.74s)]
*  You're saying that the number of bodies that we find, the number of deaths, it's almost because the system is designed that way. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  Explain that. Yeah. So there's a policy that was implemented under the Clinton administration called prevention through deterrence. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=366.86s)]
*  And so in the in the sort of late 80s and early 90s, the Border Patrol began to pilot this enforcement technique where, you know, at that time, you had a lot of most migrant traffic was crossing through cities and towns along the border. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=376.26s)]
*  And so the Border Patrol response was to sort of throw a lot of manpower right along the border, you know, stationing an agent every half a mile from one another. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=391.26s)]
*  And it completely shut down traffic and pushed it to the outskirts of town outside of the public eye, away from cameras, away from concerned voters. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, the thinking was, as that policy was adapted into a national policy, that the deserts are so remote and so hostile, there's no water, there's rugged mountains, you know, that people aren't going to risk their lives. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=414.34000000000003s)]
*  It would be a natural disincentive. Exactly. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  And and a deterrent. And of course, what we saw as soon as just a few years after this policy was implemented was a huge uptick in the number of deaths that were occurring in the desert in places like Pima County, where I live now. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=431.9s)]
*  And, you know, I think if that was an unintended consequence at the time, it has now been continued by design because there has been a complete failure of political will to do anything to change that situation. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=447.38s)]
*  We've known that people are dying in the desert now for decades. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=463.82s)]
*  Would a wall work to fix that? Because that seems to be part of the argument. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=466.78s)]
*  Hey, guess what? If we can slow the volume of people, then we will slow inevitably the volume of people dying in the middle of the desert. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=471.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, actually, you know, a wall has walls along these, you know, border towns have have actually exacerbated this problem, right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=478.29999999999995s)]
*  That's part of what has caused people to cross through more and more distant, remote, obscure areas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=489.22s)]
*  And so, you know, you if you did build a wall from sea to shining sea, I think you would only see a continuation of this, right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=497.98s)]
*  You would see people crossing on on ships and boats. And I mean, look at what is happening in the Mediterranean. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=505.66s)]
*  Militarization doesn't just come to an end once you complete a border wall like that mentality continues. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=511.38000000000005s)]
*  It's been, you know, it's been in place for decades and really for centuries. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=516.66s)]
*  If you look at the history of westward expansion and militarization in the borderlands. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=521.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you also spend several dozen pages chronicling despicable human beings, drug traffickers and how they exploit people. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=526.78s)]
*  Aren't those people that we should be figuring out a way to keep out? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  Sure, but I think that our policies have have really emboldened a lot of those people. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=541.4599999999999s)]
*  As it became more difficult to cross the border, it became more profitable to traffic people across the border. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=546.46s)]
*  So these sort of powerful drug cartels that already had, you know, these strategies for smuggling drugs across the border unseen, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=551.6600000000001s)]
*  realize that there was now a lot of money to be made in doing the same thing with people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=560.5400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, even with like child separation, which is another example of a deterrence based policy, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=565.94s)]
*  We're going to make it hell for these people to cross through the border. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=572.54s)]
*  We're going to separate them from their children. That's going to send a message of deterrence. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=576.66s)]
*  You know, in a lot of ways, that sort of exacerbated this problem because after that was met with outrage and then sort of called off by the Trump administration, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=581.9399999999999s)]
*  a lot of these smuggling groups in Mexico and Central America, they were like, did you see what just happened? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=591.3s)]
*  They're going to separate you from your children. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=597.0999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, like we better go now because who knows what this guy is going to do next? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=598.98s)]
*  You know, they use that as an opportunity to bring people across, to make them pay more money. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=603.78s)]
*  And I think. You know, it begs the question, what is an unintended consequence? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=609.9s)]
*  And when is when is it a consequence that, you know, we're OK with? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  The book takes a turn when you tell us a story of someone that you were working next to for an extended period of time, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=621.62s)]
*  you find out that he's undocumented, he takes a trip back home and he's kind of stuck. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=627.06s)]
*  You said that this is one of the first times that you realized what happens to a person after you arrest them, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=634.18s)]
*  that that wasn't really part of your training or part of what you guys prepared for as border patrol agents. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=640.3399999999999s)]
*  This person, Jose, who is somebody I met, you know, several years after leaving the border patrol and, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=646.18s)]
*  somebody that I worked with and became friends with over the course of several years, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=654.5s)]
*  all of a sudden in seeing what happened to him after, you know, he left the country to go again, be with a dying parent. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=659.9000000000001s)]
*  And he was somebody who had lived in the United States for 30 years, had three U.S. citizen children. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=667.98s)]
*  And when he was attempting to come back into the country, he was apprehended and put through deportation proceedings. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=674.98s)]
*  And, you know, so suddenly I was, as somebody who was somewhat familiar with the system, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=682.62s)]
*  I was, you know, attempting to sort of make sense of it for his family and say, oh, he's going to be here at this courthouse. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=688.06s)]
*  He's being detained here. And so I was sort of like taking, you know, his kids and his wife to see him in these different contexts [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=694.4599999999999s)]
*  and these different places within the deportation and industrial complex. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=703.02s)]
*  And for me, that was really the first time that I was looking behind the curtain at what would happen to everybody, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=708.34s)]
*  you know, after they're encountered in the desert and sent, you know, to court or to these privately run detention centers. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=713.62s)]
*  This is Jose speaking or you're writing in through his voice. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=721.62s)]
*  I'd rather be in prison in the U.S. and see my boys once a week through the glass than to stay here and be separated from my family. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=725.5400000000001s)]
*  At least I'd be closer to them. So you see, there's nothing that can keep me from crossing. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  My boys are not dogs to be abandoned in the street. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=735.34s)]
*  I will walk through the desert for five days, eight days, ten days, whatever it takes to be with them. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=737.94s)]
*  I'll eat grass, I'll eat bushes, I'll eat cactus, I'll drink filthy cattle water. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=742.1s)]
*  I'll drink nothing at all. I'll run and hide from La Migra. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=745.7800000000001s)]
*  I'll pay the Mafia's whatever I have to. They can take my money. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  They can do they can rob my family. They can lock me away. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=751.3800000000001s)]
*  But I will keep coming back. I will keep crossing again and again until I make it until I am together again with my family. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=755.22s)]
*  Now, some of the audience is going to be inspired by the words of a resolute father. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=761.2600000000001s)]
*  And someone else is going to say this is exactly the evidence necessary for why the U.S. needs more border security. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=765.06s)]
*  But I think what the evidence actually shows us, what his words reveal, is that no matter what version of hell we implement through policy at the border, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=772.5s)]
*  people are going to endure it to get to the other side, especially when, you know, their wives, children, fathers, mothers are on the other side. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=783.8599999999999s)]
*  Or when there is, you know, the security of safety from, you know, the certain threat of death in the community that you're fleeing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=794.66s)]
*  And so I think that, you know, I think that he also shows us that, you know, the people with the best family values, you know, the the. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=803.4599999999999s)]
*  Something he told me is that I respect the law. You know, I respect the laws of the United States. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=814.2199999999999s)]
*  The laws of the United States are what makes it a safe environment that I want to live in, that I want to raise my family. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=820.06s)]
*  And so I have the utmost laws of the United. I have the utmost respect for those laws. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=826.8199999999999s)]
*  But if those laws are keeping me separate from my children, then, you know, I have to break the law. I have to. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=831.66s)]
*  Look, there's going to be people with more hard line positions on immigration that are going to say, OK, this disillusionment that this man has gone through, he's the outlier. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=839.66s)]
*  But if it was so bad, why aren't we hearing this from so many other border agents? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=848.86s)]
*  Why isn't the system rebelling against itself? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=853.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just don't think that that's the way institutions work, right? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=858.0600000000001s)]
*  Like institutions rarely change from within. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=861.66s)]
*  I think that, you know, everything is being done from the moment that you sign up at your border patrol recruitment facility and you show up at the Border Patrol Academy. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=866.74s)]
*  Everything is being done to normalize the activities that you're participating in and to sort of, you know, desensitize you to the hard realities that you're seeing and participating in. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=878.4599999999999s)]
*  It's managed to be contained and it's managed to be politicized in all of these ways that kind of, you know, what an average border patrol agent thinks, you know, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=894.54s)]
*  is not even a subject of debate, right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=906.86s)]
*  Like how many border patrol agents are even allowed to give interviews? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=909.18s)]
*  I mean, a lot of border patrol agents probably live in fear of speaking out because they have a mortgage, they have families. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=913.0600000000001s)]
*  This is a good job that offers a lot of security, especially if they're coming from, you know, these small rural border towns where there's not a lot of great employment opportunities. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=920.18s)]
*  You've gotten criticism at some of your readings from people who said, listen, you are profiting and exploiting the pain of these people. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=931.0600000000001s)]
*  You are part of a system that brought that pain onto them. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=937.46s)]
*  What's your response been to them? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=940.38s)]
*  Well, you know, I think in a lot of ways they're making a really important argument that, you know, anybody who's in journalism or who's writing nonfiction about these kinds of issues needs to grapple with. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=942.86s)]
*  If you're sharing the stories from a marginalized community and sort of making your living that way, I think it's really important to grapple with, you know, who's making money off of whose story, you know, who's being recognized as the author of a story if you're sharing other people's life experiences. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  And so I've been really appreciative of those criticisms and those conversations. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=980.78s)]
*  I think they've they've made me be a lot more intentional with what I do from what I do with the money that I earn from the royalties of this book. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=986.78s)]
*  Percentage of the royalties goes to groups that are working to end death and disappearance in the borderlands and mass incarceration in the borderlands. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=999.26s)]
*  You know, given your family history, how complicated was being a border patrol agent? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1009.6600000000001s)]
*  Here you are, a fluent Spanish speaker. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1016.26s)]
*  You've got Mexican heritage as well. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1018.5s)]
*  Do you feel like you're betraying one group of people and then here you are an American citizen and you're tasked with upholding a law of this country? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1020.5s)]
*  So what was that stress like? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1029.94s)]
*  I mean, I think it was really hard for my mother, especially. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1032.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think she she sort of did a lot to try to convince me that it wasn't the right idea or to sort of convince me that my ideas, my motivations were naive. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1039.3s)]
*  And I think in retrospect, there was a lot that my that my mother had to say. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1054.26s)]
*  My mother had to say, you know, I'm usually right there. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1058.22s)]
*  They're usually right. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1062.9s)]
*  I stepped into the border patrol knowing that it was. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1065.34s)]
*  You know, knowing that it was part of a lot of ugliness and knowing I had the idea, though, as a young person, that I could witness that without participating in it, right. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  That I could sort of see it and learn from it, but not be implicated in it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1083.14s)]
*  And I think that's like a profoundly naive idea to think that you can step into an institution and sort of see things from within without participating in them. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1087.7s)]
*  Francisco Cantu, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1097.3400000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. It's been a pleasure. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeH5sFZdMaE&t=1099.38s)]
