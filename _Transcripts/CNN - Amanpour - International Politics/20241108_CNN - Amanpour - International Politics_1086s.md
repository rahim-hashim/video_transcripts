# What Trump’s Second Term Could Mean For the Rest of the World  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI)
*  Well, only months after Biden hosted the 75th anniversary of the NATO alliance, the conversation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=0.0s)]
*  turns now to how Trump's foreign policy will affect the United States' role in the world. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=5.36s)]
*  In his latest piece for The New York Times, David Sanger argues that Trump's win ends a post-World [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=10.56s)]
*  War II era of U.S. leadership, and he joins Walter Isaacson to discuss. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=15.84s)]
*  Thank you, Biana and David Sanger. Welcome to the show. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=21.52s)]
*  Great to be back with you, Walter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=25.2s)]
*  It's been 75 years since America has led a world order that was sort of based on defensive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=27.12s)]
*  alliances like NATO, but also gradually decreasing tariffs, more free trade, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=33.68s)]
*  more free movement of people. Does this election of Donald Trump for the second time [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=40.0s)]
*  mean the end of that world order? Walter, it may well. You know, in the days when, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=46.16s)]
*  after President Biden was elected four years ago, he went around telling American allies, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=54.08s)]
*  the British, the French, the Japanese, the South Koreans, America is back. And what he meant by [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=61.2s)]
*  that was that the four years of Donald Trump's first term were an aberration. They were the blip [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=69.12s)]
*  in the system. And he represented the return of traditional alliance building. After all, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=77.92s)]
*  President Biden was in many ways the sort of last warrior of the old Cold War. He had come to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=86.08s)]
*  age in the United States Senate during that time. He ran the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=93.28s)]
*  and he had, of course, been vice president during one of the most critical periods of the post-Cold [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=99.36s)]
*  War era. Now, with President Trump's re-election, the real question is, was Biden the blip? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=106.16s)]
*  Could President Biden be viewed by history later on as sort of the last gasp of that old order, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=117.92s)]
*  one marked, as you noted, by building alliances, relying on NATO, building up alliances in the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=125.12s)]
*  Pacific, which was really a hallmark of Biden's four years in office, free trade, or at least [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=132.64s)]
*  freer trade, the concept of 100%, 200%, 400% tariffs, as now President-elect Trump talked [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=140.88s)]
*  about during the campaign? You wouldn't have heard that come very easily out of Joe Biden's lips. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, Joe Biden said, this is not who we are. He kept saying that when talking about it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=159.2s)]
*  But let's look at American history. I mean, from the time of Washington and Jefferson [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=163.92s)]
*  warning against entangling foreign alliances, we've generally been skeptical about going abroad for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  monsters to slay. Is this sort of a natural thing that America has felt, and that's one of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=176.32s)]
*  reasons Trump got elected? That cycle of history has been a part of the fabric of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=183.28s)]
*  the United States, as you note, throughout its history. People have written many a book about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=191.04s)]
*  when these cycles come into play. Samuel Huntington wrote about how they happened every 70 years. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=198.8s)]
*  Others saw particular triggers in American society for it. But the fact of the matter is, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=206.56s)]
*  it's a recurrent theme. It was certainly a theme in this election, although I don't think the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=213.6s)]
*  dominant theme. I think what got Trump elected over Kamala Harris was, as you would expect, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=220.64s)]
*  much more domestic issues, inflation, the social wage issues that Trump kept pressing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=228.96s)]
*  You saw him take out a lot of ads on TV, and you saw them on social media about trans issues. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=238.0s)]
*  You didn't see many about NATO issues. President Putin of Russia congratulated Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think he praised Trump's desire to restore relations with Russia and to end the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=254.72s)]
*  Ukrainian crisis. Do you think there's a possibility, and is it a good thing or bad thing, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=262.24s)]
*  that Trump will work with Putin and end the Ukrainian war? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  He may well end the Ukrainian war, and I know many people both within Trump's circle and some [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=274.32s)]
*  outside who think that with Trump coming in, that war may be over within a year or so. I'm [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=281.76s)]
*  not sure I fully sign on to that, but it's not only a question of whether the war ends, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=288.48s)]
*  it's a question of how it ends. So the Biden bywords here were nothing about Ukraine without [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=294.8s)]
*  Ukraine, which was to say, we're not going to go negotiate around your back with Vladimir Putin [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=303.68s)]
*  and decide the lines between Russia and Ukraine. You've never heard those words from Donald Trump, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=310.72s)]
*  and when he says that he will end the war in 24 hours, many believe that what he's really saying [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=318.72s)]
*  there is that he will end the war by calling Putin, saying, okay, what deal do you need? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  What's the deal we can strike? Putin will say, well, why don't we start with the 20% of Ukraine [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=333.04s)]
*  that I now basically occupy? At which point the theory goes he would then call Zelensky and say, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=339.36s)]
*  do I ever have a deal for you? All you have to do is give up 20% of your territory and this war will [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=346.32s)]
*  be over and you won't suffer these awful casualties. And what happens when Zelensky says no? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=354.32s)]
*  Then he says, you know, I'm not really sure we can continue supporting you at the level we've [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  been supporting you. And what's the danger of that? I mean, why is it better to keep this war [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=368.64s)]
*  going on for another five years? It may not be better, but the question is, is the message that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=376.24s)]
*  you send around the world that Putin can be rewarded for invading another country and ending [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  up with some of his territory? Or if you view it the way I think President Trump and many of his [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=391.2s)]
*  advocates view it, do you say, look, all wars end with a negotiated settlement. Zelensky's been [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=397.36s)]
*  incapable of getting that negotiation going. We're going to help him along in that process. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=404.16s)]
*  Well, wait, tell me what your view on that is. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=409.76s)]
*  Well, my view on that is that at the end of the day, my guess is this war will only end [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=412.48s)]
*  with territory either being given to Russia or Korea-like being in dispute. That is to say [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=418.72s)]
*  that there's an armistice of some kind and an agreement to negotiate on territory at some point [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=425.44s)]
*  in the future. Now, in 1953, this looked terrible to the South Koreans because they were saying [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=431.76s)]
*  they've lost territory of their own that used to be theirs. If you had been able to say to the South [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=438.64s)]
*  Koreans back then, you know, in 70 years plus, you will be one of the world's largest economies [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  and your citizens will be able to travel the world and you'll be among the most admired [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=452.88s)]
*  manufacturing countries in the world and a high-tech country to boot making products that even the United [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=459.92s)]
*  States in some cases is having a hard time making, I think the Koreans would have taken that deal. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=467.36s)]
*  There's no way to make that guarantee to the Ukrainians, but it is possible, given the talent [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=473.6s)]
*  that we've seen the Ukrainians have, that they should think about rebuilding the country and that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=479.2s)]
*  that is a bigger issue than territory. I'm not sure Zelensky thinks that way and giving away [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  territory might be the end of him politically, but you know, this is what happens at the end of long [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=491.92s)]
*  slogging wars where it becomes clear that the Ukrainians in this case are unlikely to be able [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=498.96s)]
*  to defend all their territory. In your book, New Cold Wars, you talk about how General H.R. McMaster [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=506.16s)]
*  is working with Trump, National Security Advisor, said that Trump felt he could break through with [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=514.08s)]
*  Putin on a personal level and McMaster said don't go down that path, that's not going to be a good [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=519.44s)]
*  idea. What happened and can you take from the first term and do you think he will try to have [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=525.52s)]
*  a personal relationship in the second term? Oh, I'm certain he will. I mean, first of all, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=532.08s)]
*  one of his critiques of President Biden is that Biden and Putin only met once. They met in June [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=537.36s)]
*  of 2021. That was over cyber attacks that emanated from Russia and hit the American oil and gas [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=544.24s)]
*  pipelines. It was not largely about Ukraine. They barely communicated since, never met in person [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=553.36s)]
*  during that time. I am quite certain that President-elect Trump believes that what works [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=562.64s)]
*  in diplomacy is in what he would call great man diplomacy, that he can talk to Vladimir Putin, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  that he can talk to Xi Jinping, that they're scared of him, that Xi would not dare to take Taiwan [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=577.36s)]
*  because he thinks that Trump is blanking crazy. That's what he told the Wall Street Journal. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=587.04s)]
*  So he is very much of the belief that the personal diplomacy is the key to all of this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=594.08s)]
*  I think that can be a bit of a trap because the Chinese learned how to play President-elect [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  Trump by dangling trade deals. Putin seemed to develop a relationship with him that put very few [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=608.24s)]
*  limits on the Russians. But I'm sure that Trump believes that he can bring about peace in Ukraine [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=617.28s)]
*  and the end of the new Cold Wars through the strength of his personal diplomas. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=627.04s)]
*  WOLFF, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=632.4s)]
*  COUNSELOR, FEDERATION OF THE COUNTRY OF THE RUSSIAN COUNTRY, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=632.54s)]
*  THE COUNTRY OF THE RUSSIAN COUNTRY, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=632.9599999999999s)]
*  One of the biggest shifts in the past five, six, seven years has been the growing alliance [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=633.04s)]
*  between Russia and China. You're teaching there at the Kennedy School with Graham Allison, of course, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=639.6s)]
*  and you certainly know the Bismarck and Medernich warnings about letting your two adversaries [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=645.28s)]
*  get closer to each other than to you. Is this a huge mistake in foreign policy? And what can Trump [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=652.24s)]
*  do to reverse that growing alliance between Russia and China? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=658.4s)]
*  WOLFF, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=662.16s)]
*  COUNSELOR, FEDERATION OF THE COUNTRY OF THE RUSSIAN COUNTRY, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=662.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, this alliance barely showed itself during the first Trump term. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=662.72s)]
*  And early in the years that Biden was in office, he didn't even acknowledge that it was likely [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=670.4s)]
*  to happen. I asked him at a press conference about a year into his presidency, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=676.96s)]
*  did he believe that the Russia-China partnership, I wouldn't call it a full alliance, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=681.76s)]
*  is a real thing? And he said, no, I don't think these two countries can get together. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=689.12s)]
*  By the time he did his last press conference, which was after the NATO summit in the summer, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=694.32s)]
*  he admitted that he had a program to try to get between the two countries, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=700.08s)]
*  to try to stop this, the way Nixon and Kissinger, as you wrote in your Kissinger biography, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=705.44s)]
*  tried to design the opening to China to keep the Chinese and the then Soviet Union from coming [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=712.08s)]
*  together. Now, Biden would not describe the elements of that strategy. And my guess is that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  a good deal of it was covert. And a lot of it was aimed at stopping the flow of technology [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=728.6400000000001s)]
*  from China to rebuild the Russian military. But the fact of the matter is that there has been [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=734.88s)]
*  a policy of trying to get in the way of this relationship, not terribly successfully. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=741.68s)]
*  We never heard during the campaign, Walter, not once any reference to this, the biggest change [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=746.72s)]
*  in geopolitics, I think, in the past four or five years. During the campaign, we never heard it come [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=753.36s)]
*  out of Vice President Harris's mouth. We never heard it come out of President-elect Trump's mouth. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=760.96s)]
*  And so we don't know whether or not he will try to interfere in that relationship. My guess is he's so [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=768.1600000000001s)]
*  transactional that he believes that he can sort of negotiate side deals with each one of them, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=776.32s)]
*  and that that alone will sort of weave in the way of this. I don't think he's going to look at this [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=783.44s)]
*  in a sort of grand strategic, Kissingerian way. Amid all the turmoil in the Middle East right now, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=788.8s)]
*  what effect will Trump's election have, especially on Israel's war against Hezbollah, Hamas, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=797.3599999999999s)]
*  and for that matter against all Iranian proxies and perhaps even Iran? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=803.92s)]
*  So if you're Netanyahu, your strategy has just paid off. Netanyahu from early in the year was [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  basically waiting out the administration. He'd get these letters from Secretary of State Blinken [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=817.68s)]
*  or Secretary of Defense Austin saying there are legal restrictions on the way that you can use [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=823.76s)]
*  American-provided weaponry, and if you don't allow aid into Gaza or you're using those weapons [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=830.2399999999999s)]
*  against civilians, there will be restrictions. And he basically tossed them aside and said, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  let's wait for the election, because he knows that the Trump view, in fact, we believe President [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=844.4s)]
*  Trump said this to him in a conversation a few weeks ago, is do what you need to do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=851.12s)]
*  And so the era of restrictions is going to be over. And that was the message that Harris [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=859.36s)]
*  was trying to send out in Michigan to the Arab populace and others who were very unhappy with [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=865.6s)]
*  the way she dealt with the war against Hamas in Gaza. And her answer was, at least we're [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=874.56s)]
*  pushing Netanyahu a bit, Trump wouldn't push him at all. Former Defense Secretary Panetta said that [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump would give Netanyahu a blank check. Is that sort of true? And if so, what will happen? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=890.0s)]
*  I think that probably is true. I don't think you're going to see President Trump put any [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=897.52s)]
*  restrictions. I think the place where the rubber will hit the road on this, Walter, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=903.2s)]
*  will be on Iran itself. You'll remember that during the first term, President Trump talked a [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=909.52s)]
*  very tough line against Iran, but he pulled back once or twice when there were opportunities [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=915.2s)]
*  to get into a deeper conflict with them. He did order the killing of General Soleimani, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  the head of the Quds Force, one of the most elite military commanders in Iran, but he pulled back [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=927.6s)]
*  from opening up a broader war with them. We don't know what his view is now, but the Iranians have, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  of course, we believe, sent out or at least tried to order up hit teams against Trump when [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=942.48s)]
*  he was candidate. They denounced him. Their cyber operations in the United States were anti-Trump, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=948.64s)]
*  even while the Russians were pro-Trump. So my guess is that Trump comes into office with a [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=955.76s)]
*  much-heartened view about Iran and may well not stand in the way of Netanyahu if he decides [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=963.6s)]
*  to go after Iranian nuclear facilities, for example, and so forth. I don't know that Netanyahu [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=973.28s)]
*  is going to do that. He's hesitated himself a few times, but certainly that was a big concern of the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=979.44s)]
*  Biden administration just in the last few months. One of the successes of Trump's first term in the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=985.44s)]
*  Middle East was the Abraham Accords, and there has been a sense that he would like to have a [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=990.72s)]
*  growing alliance with Saudi Arabia, some of the Gulf states, Israel, all as part of an alliance [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=996.72s)]
*  against Iran. Do you think that is a strategic shift that could happen in the second Trump term? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1005.84s)]
*  I do, and that was a line of consistency between the Trump administration and the Biden [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1013.2s)]
*  administration. Joe Biden and his aides did not have very nice things to say about Trump foreign [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1021.0400000000001s)]
*  policy except when it came to the Abraham Accords, where on that issue and the issue of supporting [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1027.1200000000001s)]
*  U.S. technology against China, they praised the way Trump went about it. And of course, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1035.44s)]
*  they were trying to reconstruct the Saudi Arabia deal in the days before the October 7, 2023 [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1042.24s)]
*  attacks. They hoped that that might come back this year. It did not. I think it's very possible that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1050.56s)]
*  Trump may push in that direction, and if he did, I think that could actually change the diplomatic [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1058.16s)]
*  complexion of the Middle East. David Sanger, thank you so much for joining us. Great to be with you. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1064.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VdJ9HaZyzI&t=1072.24s)]
