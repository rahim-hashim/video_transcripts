# Condoleezza Rice on the Record Putin, Ukraine and Threats to Democracy  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY)
*  Iran hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin last week as the two countries looked to bolster [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=0.0s)]
*  relations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=4.88s)]
*  Putin met with Iran's supreme leader. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=5.88s)]
*  Both countries are under strict sanctions from the West. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=8.16s)]
*  The war in Ukraine is influencing foreign policy, as it should, around the world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=11.0s)]
*  Walter Isakson spoke to former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to get her take. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=16.84s)]
*  Thank you, Sarah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=21.6s)]
*  And, Secretary Condoleezza Rice, welcome to the show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=22.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=26.04s)]
*  It's great to be with you, Walter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=27.04s)]
*  You were coming to us from Aspen, where you're co-chair of the Aspen Security Forum and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=29.08s)]
*  Strategy Group. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Bill Burns was just there talking to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  And let me read something he said. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=37.84s)]
*  He says, Putin really does believe his rhetoric that Ukraine is not a real country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=39.36s)]
*  He believes it's his entitlement to dominate Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=45.08s)]
*  Nobody knows Russia better than you do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=48.8s)]
*  You've been studying it your entire career. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=50.8s)]
*  Is he right, and what does that mean? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=54.14s)]
*  Oh, I think that Bill Burns is absolutely right. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  And of course, a few people know Russia better than Bill Burns either, having been ambassador [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  there and speaking fluent Russian. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=63.44s)]
*  Vladimir Putin used to tell me all the time things like, Condi, you know us, Russia's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=65.8s)]
*  only great when it's ruled by great men like Peter the Great and Alexander the Second. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=71.0s)]
*  He now compares himself to Peter the Great. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=75.84s)]
*  That very strange speech that he gave just before the invasion talked about how Lenin [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  had created Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=83.32s)]
*  He told us that Ukraine was not, that Ukraine was a made up country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=85.92s)]
*  And so I think he really does have this delusional view of history where Russian empire requires [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=90.2s)]
*  that there not be an independent Ukraine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=97.64s)]
*  And that's very hard for us to get our heads around because we thought people stopped thinking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=99.72s)]
*  that way a century or so ago. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=104.64s)]
*  But that's what we're confronted with, Walter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Does that mean there's no solution other than a victory for either side in Ukraine? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=109.92s)]
*  Well, there certainly is no solution if Ukraine is left to the tender mercies of the Russians. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=116.0s)]
*  But I continue to believe that if the Ukrainians fight as bravely as they are fighting now, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=124.2s)]
*  if we support them as fully and as completely and as quickly as we can, if we are less constraining [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=129.12s)]
*  on them and what they need to do to win this war, that at the very least they can fight [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=136.96s)]
*  the Russians to, let's say, a stalemate, that, yes, Russia may be able to hold on to some [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  territory even though I really hope that the Ukrainians can mount a counteroffensive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=152.04s)]
*  But we can absolutely make sure that Putin does not succeed in liquidating Ukraine. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=157.68s)]
*  In fact, I think he's already failed at that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=162.32s)]
*  Our goal with the Ukrainians has to be to make sure that he fails here going forward. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=165.04s)]
*  You say that perhaps the Ukrainians can hold it to a stalemate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=170.16s)]
*  Do you think then there should be like a ceasefire in place and we just put aside for a while [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=174.0s)]
*  the question of disputed territory? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=180.0s)]
*  I would never presume to tell the Ukrainians when the conditions are met that they would [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=182.36s)]
*  be prepared to take a ceasefire or an agreement. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=188.76s)]
*  These people have fought, they have suffered. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=192.76s)]
*  The Russians have committed horrendous war crimes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=195.84s)]
*  We have to support the Ukrainians until they decide that they have achieved the conditions [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=199.44s)]
*  in which they want to look for a ceasefire. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=204.88s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  This is a decision in Kiev, not in Washington, not in Berlin, not in London. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=207.84s)]
*  And, oh, by the way, when I say a stalemate, I don't mean that necessarily the fighting stops. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=212.32s)]
*  I mean that from there, perhaps they can really undermine the Russians with a combination of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=217.84s)]
*  resistance and continued military fighting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=223.96s)]
*  But we just can't let the Russians. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=226.36s)]
*  They can't let the Russians go any further. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=228.52s)]
*  They can't create a landlocked Ukraine, for instance, by winning in the south. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  And the Ukrainians are doing very well in the south. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=235.8s)]
*  So it is not for us to say when Ukraine wants to stop fighting. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  That is for the Ukrainians. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  President Putin just went to Tehran where he met with Iran's supreme leader. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  What do you make of a possible alliance or better relations between the two countries? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=250.08s)]
*  Or is that possible? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=255.44s)]
*  Well, there is no doubt that Putin is seeking allies wherever he can get them these days. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=257.72s)]
*  And frankly, Belarus is not a particularly strong read. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  So you wouldn't be surprised that he's looking for allies elsewhere. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  It might be an effort to say to the Iranians, if you help us evade sanctions, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=273.16s)]
*  we will help you evade sanctions. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=277.24s)]
*  I can imagine that that's part of the conversation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  But two pariah states, I suppose they deserve each other. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=281.88s)]
*  We have to just keep pressing hard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=286.04s)]
*  And I will say this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  This is not the time for nuclear negotiations with the Iranians, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=290.6s)]
*  with the Russians at the table. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=296.92s)]
*  This is a time to isolate Iran and isolate Russia across the board. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=299.8s)]
*  So you would cut off the talks on the Iranian nuclear deal [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  and perhaps even think the Europeans should do that, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=308.68s)]
*  Well, as far as I can tell, the Iranians have not answered the questions that they were asked [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=312.12s)]
*  by the administration on the way to a deal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=320.6s)]
*  So, yes, I think it's high time to say to the Iranians, this is over. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=324.12s)]
*  I didn't favor, to be fair, I didn't favor going back into nuclear negotiations [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=329.72s)]
*  with the Iranians in any case. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  I think we need to concentrate on isolation at this point, not on engagement. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  If we're going to isolate Iran and we're going to isolate Russia and do all these sanctions, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=341.88s)]
*  don't we have to have better relationships with China? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=347.08s)]
*  Well, the Chinese also seem to have made their choice. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=350.6s)]
*  What is it? Relationship without limits? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=354.84s)]
*  Although they must be wondering about a relationship without limits [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  that's bringing down sanctions. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=360.04s)]
*  You're talking about what he said about a relationship with Russia. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=361.96s)]
*  Xi Jinping said about Putin exactly in that little meeting that they had just before the Olympics. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=364.68s)]
*  But we just need to send, and I think the administration has done a good job here, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=371.56s)]
*  send a very clear message to the Chinese that we don't like their rhetoric, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=375.56s)]
*  but that any material assistance to the Russians would be looked upon very, very much at scant. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=380.04s)]
*  And I think the Chinese know that you would then be looking at secondary sanctions. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  So, yes, they're going to continue to buy discounted Russian oil. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=392.44s)]
*  A lot of people are doing that, but any material help to the Russians beyond that has really, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=397.08s)]
*  we have to warn the Chinese off precisely that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=403.32s)]
*  But I think, Walter, as long as we can keep unity in the Western alliance and NATO and the European [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=406.36s)]
*  Union and other countries like Japan and others that are a part of this, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=414.12s)]
*  I think we can bring the kind of pressure that we need. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=419.96s)]
*  Do you think it was a good idea for President Biden to go to Saudi Arabia and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=422.68s)]
*  sort of engage in fist bump diplomacy? And what good or bad do you think came out of that trip? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=427.88s)]
*  Well, the fact is that Saudi Arabia is an important country. It is an important economic [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=434.6s)]
*  power given its oil reserves and the fact that the world is in need of oil and gas reserves. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's an important country to, frankly, keeping the peace in the Middle East. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=452.76s)]
*  Now, the Saudis have gone quite a long way in, I won't call it rapprochement, but I will call it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=457.88s)]
*  movement toward Israel, along with the other Gulf states that have been more upfront about it, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  like the UAE or Morocco or others. But that's a positive thing for the Middle East. And [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=471.88s)]
*  the Abraham Accords ought to be encouraged and they ought to be encouraged to expand. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=477.56s)]
*  None of us wants to ignore what happened with Khashoggi. None of us wants to ignore the human [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  rights problems and abuses in Saudi Arabia. But I had to go to Saudi Arabia. President Bush went [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=488.76s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia. President Obama's been in Saudi Arabia. Who are we kidding? Presidents are going [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=496.12s)]
*  to go to Saudi Arabia. It probably is not a good thing to say that you're never going to go to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=502.12s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, which is a pariah state, and then have to go. That's the problem. It's also probably [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=509.0s)]
*  not wise to not shake hands. I mean, it felt a little bit staged somehow. And I don't know, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=517.4000000000001s)]
*  is the fist pump more intimate or less intimate? I really can't tell you. But that he went to Saudi [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=528.2800000000001s)]
*  Arabia, I don't have a problem with that. By the way, one of the ways that you limit the dependence [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=534.2s)]
*  on Saudi oil is that you fully exploit America's tremendous reserves. The North American platform [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=542.6s)]
*  for energy production, stretching from Canada down through Mexico, is a powerhouse. The United States [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=552.04s)]
*  was going to achieve independence in supply and that makes us then possible to export. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=559.96s)]
*  When you look at the places that the oil reserves are, Saudi Arabia, Russia, we've been talking [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  about Iran, would I rather that the hydrocarbons that we're going to continue to need while we make [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=574.6800000000001s)]
*  the transition to a less carbon intensive economy to favor climate change, while we're doing that, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=582.84s)]
*  those hydrocarbons ought to be coming from North America. And then you're less dependent on Saudi [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=590.6s)]
*  Arabia. You've been watching or maybe reading about the January 6th hearings. How important [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=595.64s)]
*  do you think it is that the Republican Party, of which you're a member, move on from Donald Trump? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=602.68s)]
*  Well, I am, look, I'm going to leave to the American voter who they want to be president, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=609.48s)]
*  but I am ready for, you know, a new generation of leadership. I'm ready for all of those who've had [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=615.0s)]
*  their chance to step aside and let somebody else lead. I've made very clear my views about January [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=623.72s)]
*  6th. It was a stain on American democracy. Walter, I cried that night because I thought to myself, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=630.36s)]
*  or that afternoon, I thought to myself, I study countries that do this. I don't live in a country [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=638.84s)]
*  that does this. And yet when they walked to the, the senators and congressmen walked back into [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=644.36s)]
*  the Capitol after it had been secured and in that kind of almost boring way, certified the election, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  I thanked God for Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Michael Pence, because the American [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  system held. So there is nothing more important than the peaceful transfer of power after an [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  election. And it should have happened. It should have happened without questions about voter fraud [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=676.04s)]
*  and voter suppression, by the way, both of which are terms that are meant to stop the conversation [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=685.48s)]
*  not started. And yes, we, we need a new generation of leadership for the Republican Party. And [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=690.76s)]
*  there are say maybe for the Democratic Party too. But election deniers are running for office in [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=698.04s)]
*  states across this country right now, especially in the Republican Party. What do you say to people [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=704.84s)]
*  when they're faced with somebody who's an election denier? Will you sort of tell people that's not [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=712.84s)]
*  the way they should go? I'm not going to tell people how to vote. All right, because I, I, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=718.44s)]
*  the voters have a wide variety of, of concerns when they're voting, but I am going to say [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=723.72s)]
*  that election deniers are not in my, to my mind, acting in the American Democratic way. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=731.64s)]
*  The American Democratic way is to accept the outcomes of elections, congratulate the winner, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=741.08s)]
*  and move on. If you have a belief that something's gone wrong in an election, we have courts [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=747.88s)]
*  that can hear those cases. And many, many courts heard these cases and said that, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=757.24s)]
*  including the Attorney General Bill Barr, who said there was no substantial fraud. So I would say, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=763.88s)]
*  could we just accept that and move, move on? I do want to say this, Walter, you know that I'm [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=770.76s)]
*  at a Director of the Hoover Institution and, and you know, we've been looking at some polling that [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=780.28s)]
*  Americans are losing faith in their elections. There, there is nothing more serious than [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  a democracy starting to lose faith in its elections. And when Americans are told on one hand [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=793.4s)]
*  that their elections are fraudulent, on the other hand, that people are trying to suppress [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=800.3599999999999s)]
*  the vote, no wonder they're losing faith in their elections. And so rather than saying, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=804.76s)]
*  yes, we have some issues with our elections, I for one believe voter ID is really an important [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=812.52s)]
*  thing to do. Because I went around the world as Secretary telling people not to do signature [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=818.76s)]
*  matching. Because what happens with signature matching? A woman of my age, and I'm not going [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=824.28s)]
*  to say exactly what that is, but it's like in my 60s, is sitting there as a volunteer. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=829.56s)]
*  Her eyes get tired on signature matching. So now she is throwing out votes or accepting them [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=835.96s)]
*  because she's tired. You don't, you, we need voter ID. So when people want to claim that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=843.4000000000001s)]
*  it's voter suppression to have voter ID, really? When people want to claim that it's voter fraud, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=849.48s)]
*  when the Attorney General says it's not, we somehow have got to come back to a sensible [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=855.08s)]
*  place about our elections. Wait, you seem to be equating the election deniers [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=860.44s)]
*  with people who worry about voter suppression, which may or may not be that big of a problem. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=866.44s)]
*  No, it's not. I'm not trying to equate anything, Walter. I'm just saying that when I hear [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=870.84s)]
*  those terms, they're meant to stop the conversation, not to start it. And could we just back off and [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=878.6s)]
*  look at what we actually really need to do with our elections? But no, I said the January 6th [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=886.28s)]
*  situation is sui generis. It is a unique situation in American history. But my point is, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=891.56s)]
*  we do have serious things that we need to do about our elections. But until we stop calling names, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=899.9599999999999s)]
*  we're not going to be able to deal with them. In your 2019 book, which I really love because it [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=905.88s)]
*  was very prescient, it was called To Build a Better World, you talked about the rise of populism [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=910.84s)]
*  around the world and sort of the anti-establishment politics. And you wrote about the four horses of [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  the apocalypse, populism, nativism, protectionism, and isolationism. What do you say now after three [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=924.36s)]
*  years? It seems to have gotten worse. Yeah, I'm afraid I think it is getting worse. And in part, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=933.0s)]
*  Walter, I think we all have to take some responsibility that those of us who talked [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=942.28s)]
*  glowingly about globalization didn't actually think about people who were getting left behind [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=947.88s)]
*  in globalization. If you're the unemployed coal miner or the unemployed steel worker in Great [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=954.12s)]
*  Britain, globalization didn't treat you very fairly. And people's skills didn't keep pace with [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=960.12s)]
*  what was needed. And it's by the way, not just globalization, it's automation as well. And so [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=966.84s)]
*  I think the only way to beat back those four horsemen of the apocalypse is to make opportunity [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=973.88s)]
*  real for people in the world in which we live, not the nostalgic world of the past. And we've got a [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=981.32s)]
*  lot of work to do. You know that I'm a great proponent of looking hard at our K-12 education [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=989.32s)]
*  system, looking hard at skills development. We need a human potential initiative in the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=995.5600000000001s)]
*  United States, because if people don't believe that they can get ahead, they're going to be [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=1002.0400000000001s)]
*  susceptible to the siren songs of populists who will tell them it's not their fault, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=1008.2s)]
*  it's somebody else's fault. Secretary Condoleezza Rice, thank you for joining us. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=1013.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Walter. It's great to be with you. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLOp5mCC7uY&t=1018.36s)]
