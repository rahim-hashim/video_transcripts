# Meryl Streep and Female Afghan Leaders on Women's Rights in Afghanistan | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk)
*  Up next, we turn to Afghanistan, where, in an unprecedented move, the Taliban are to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=0.0s)]
*  be taken to the International Court of Justice. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It will be the first time a country will be taken to court over gender discrimination. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=7.3s)]
*  And it is thanks to the tireless efforts of the brave Afghan women standing up for their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=12.4s)]
*  rights, like former lawmaker Fahzia Koufi and the nation's first female governor, Habiba [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=16.56s)]
*  Sarabi. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=21.92s)]
*  They joined legendary actress Meryl Streep at the United Nations this week to promote [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=23.2s)]
*  a new documentary called The Sharp Edge of Peace, which follows the doomed efforts of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=27.18s)]
*  peace talks with the Taliban back in 2020. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=32.86s)]
*  Christiane sat down with all three of them to discuss how much has changed. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=35.82s)]
*  Meryl, Fahzia and Habiba, welcome to the program. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=40.42s)]
*  I want to ask you first, Meryl, you introduced the film, you were at the United Nations with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=45.66s)]
*  all the women, the secretary general was there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=50.78s)]
*  You started by saying the following about your Afghan sisters. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=53.46s)]
*  Today in Kabul, a female cat has more freedoms than a woman. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=58.38s)]
*  A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=65.58s)]
*  She may chase a squirrel into the park. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=72.06s)]
*  A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today because the public parks [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=75.82s)]
*  have been closed to women and girls by the Taliban. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  A bird may sing in Kabul, but a girl may not and a woman may not in public. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=87.30000000000001s)]
*  This is extraordinary. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  This is a suppression of the natural law. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=97.5s)]
*  What about this touches you and makes you be involved? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=100.56s)]
*  Well, I have followed the plight of women in Afghanistan for about 20 years with my [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=105.46s)]
*  friend Jessica Newworth and the work of the Women's Forum. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=113.38s)]
*  I have been very interested in women's rights around the world and in the United States [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=119.58s)]
*  and still am. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=126.86s)]
*  This most recent edict that people can't speak in public, that they have to completely [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=130.02s)]
*  hide themselves, it's like the erasure of an entire gender and I don't think it has [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=137.18s)]
*  precedence in history, even in the natural world. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=141.66s)]
*  One part of the species erases the presence of another and I think it's particularly [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=148.3s)]
*  an eloquent moment to raise where we are in the world with Afghan rights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=155.62s)]
*  And Fozio, you've been a member of parliament for a long time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=161.18s)]
*  You've been a really public spokeswoman for Afghanistan and especially the women of Afghanistan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=163.82s)]
*  As Meryl says, she's been following the plight of Afghan women for 20 years, but for 20 years [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=169.1s)]
*  you had freedoms that you'd never had before. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=174.5s)]
*  Your film, The Sharp Edge of Peace, shows Afghan women singing, dancing, playing taekwondo, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  girls and women active members of society. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=182.82s)]
*  There's a clip of an interview with you on the tarmac of the airport in which you, Fozio, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=187.06s)]
*  expressed real hope that actually so much change had happened that they could not roll [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=191.94s)]
*  back the rights for women. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=196.66s)]
*  We're just going to play that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=198.98s)]
*  Describe what it's like today. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=212.78s)]
*  Well, I think the one thing Taliban failed to understand that Afghanistan has transformed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=221.54s)]
*  and that transformation is not only limited to Kabul in terms of liberty, in terms of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=226.94s)]
*  women rights, in terms of people believing in the future of their daughters more. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=232.18s)]
*  My father established the first school in our village, but he never allowed my elder [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=237.34s)]
*  sisters to go to school. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=241.02s)]
*  People from the same village over the last 20 years came to me asking school for their [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=243.06s)]
*  girls to be established. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=248.02s)]
*  So that's a transformed Afghanistan and that's a transformed woman of Afghanistan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=249.3s)]
*  You see them despite being completely erased from any kind of public and social life, they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=253.22s)]
*  still protest. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=258.74s)]
*  Living in Kabul in Afghanistan these days for any human beings is not easy because the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=260.46s)]
*  new edict also put rule on men's size of beard, on men's work and job that they can [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=264.62s)]
*  choose. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=273.22s)]
*  But despite all of that, women still show resilience. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=274.22s)]
*  That is a sign of a different Afghanistan that the Taliban don't get that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=278.46s)]
*  And I think this is the same Afghanistan in 1996 where they were suppressing people and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=282.66s)]
*  they were silent. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=286.7s)]
*  Today every woman in Afghanistan is a journalist. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=288.1s)]
*  Every woman in Afghanistan is a TV by talking about what their experience is. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=291.94s)]
*  So as much as they suffer, they suppress them, it's like they're popping up in a different [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=297.3s)]
*  way, in a different method. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=303.14s)]
*  Can I ask you Habiba, because you were the first appointed governor right after the fall [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=304.82s)]
*  of the Taliban, after democracy in a certain way and certainly more liberty for women came [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=308.58s)]
*  after 2001. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=314.94s)]
*  Some people think, you know, this was just a project in the urban centers, just Kabul, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=318.3s)]
*  just Herat. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  But you were in Bamyan, I mean you were in full agricultural countryside. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  They took to your authority without protesting against it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=329.54s)]
*  You were accepted as an authority figure as a female governor. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=334.06s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=337.42s)]
*  And also not only accepted but also welcomed. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=338.42s)]
*  So I remember the time when I was appointed as a governor, when I went to Bamyan and thousands [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=343.9s)]
*  of people were coming to welcome me. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=350.41999999999996s)]
*  So this, it was a point of history in Bamyan and the history of Afghanistan. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jJngi53bk&t=353.21999999999997s)]
