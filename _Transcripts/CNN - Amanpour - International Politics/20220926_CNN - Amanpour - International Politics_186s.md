Video Description: For ten straight days Iran has been engulfed in protests -- the most widespread since the Green Revolution of 2009. The issue this time is oppression of women, especially the current hardline government’s rigid dress code. Fury erupted when 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in custody after her arrest by the country's morality police. State media and human rights groups say dozens have been killed in the violence so far. Despite internet restrictions and the harsh crackdown of security forces, the protests show no sign of abating. In fact, the unrest is spreading. Demonstrations took place outside Iranian embassies in London and Paris over the weekend. To discuss, Christiane speaks with Marjane Satrapi, the French-Iranian author best known for her illustrated memoir "Persepolis" in which she recounts growing up in Iran during the revolution.

# Marjane Satrapi: Young Iranians "Want Democracy" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0)
*  Maggihan, let me ask you because you said it's very different this time and you have been speaking to young people in Iran from where you are in Paris. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=0.0s)]
*  What are they saying to you, boys and girls, what are they saying to you? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=8.0s)]
*  What they say to me is that they don't want this system anymore, they want democracy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=13.0s)]
*  I mean they don't believe in the reform and their rights. Iran's government is a dictatorship. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=21.0s)]
*  If a dictatorship opens for reform, for being transformed, it stops being a dictatorship. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=27.0s)]
*  Reform and dictatorship doesn't go together. So this is something not possible. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=33.0s)]
*  You cannot make this government to become a democratic government because it is not in its spaces. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=38.0s)]
*  It's a dictatorship and they want a new government, they want a new regime, they want a new system. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=45.0s)]
*  And I talk to them and this generation is very, very different from us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=52.0s)]
*  I mean we have to know that the time that the Islamic Revolution happened, only 40% of Iranian people could read and write. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=57.0s)]
*  Now it's above 80% of them. These people are born with the internet. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=64.0s)]
*  They have access to the information around the world. This new generation, first of all they claim not to be sexist at all. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=69.0s)]
*  You see, I mean the big slogan is zan zandeghi azadi, woman, life, freedom. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=77.0s)]
*  And the human rights, I mean the women's rights is the human rights. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=84.0s)]
*  In any society, Iran or anywhere else in the world, if the women are repressed, if half of the population, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=88.0s)]
*  they are actually worth half of the other half just because of their gender, we cannot talk about democracy and human rights. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=96.0s)]
*  Women's rights and human rights are the same thing and this is something that they have understood. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=105.0s)]
*  So that gives lots of hope because I always thought and I always believed that the biggest enemy of democracy is the patriarchal culture. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=110.0s)]
*  Yet this young boy, this young, I spoke actually with one today, and he was like, of course we are equal to the girls. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=119.0s)]
*  Of course there is no difference. And this generation, you cannot fool them like they fooled others. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=128.0s)]
*  And Iranian people in general, they are much more secular than 40 years ago. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=134.0s)]
*  And this is exactly the basis of the problem. You have a government which is not absolutely in touch with its population. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=139.0s)]
*  It doesn't know what the population wants. They think they are the majority. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=146.0s)]
*  They have a basis for sure. But this is not the majority of the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=150.0s)]
*  If the majority of the country was with the government, it would not be called a dictatorship again. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=154.0s)]
*  And yes, so knowing all of that, if a government is not in touch with its population, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=160.0s)]
*  it cannot govern them because you have to know your people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJ5i6Buuf0&t=167.0s)]
