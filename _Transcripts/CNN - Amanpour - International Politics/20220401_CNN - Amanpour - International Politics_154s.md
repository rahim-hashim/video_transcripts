# Dmytro Kuleba Hopes the West Will Not Get Tired of Supporting Ukraine | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4)
*  Are you convinced that the public opinion and therefore the allies' stance will remain [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=0.0s)]
*  solid no matter how long this goes on for? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, I want to be straight on one issue. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=9.28s)]
*  Whatever happens at the table of negotiations, more sanctions have to be imposed against [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=13.52s)]
*  Russia and more weapons have to be supplied to Ukraine, because these are the real arguments [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=20.36s)]
*  in talks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=25.52s)]
*  The stronger Ukraine is, the more painful the pressure on Russia is, the stronger our [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=26.8s)]
*  position in talks is, and therefore the better are the chances to get a good agreement, an [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=34.92s)]
*  agreement that would respect Ukraine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=41.88s)]
*  And this is, this must be absolutely clear. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=44.72s)]
*  No one should be using an argument that since people are talking, sitting at the table and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  talking to each other, let's put sanctions on hold or let's not supply certain weapons [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=51.16s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=56.379999999999995s)]
*  This is a war, again, I would like to remind it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=57.379999999999995s)]
*  And I think it makes sense for our friends and partners to continue supporting us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=59.54s)]
*  When it comes to the public perception of the war, of course, we live in the real world. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  And I understand that many other events may be taking place in the coming weeks that will [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=72.1s)]
*  distract the attention of the world public opinion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=77.62s)]
*  But this Russian aggression against Ukraine is a threat to entire war global security. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=83.7s)]
*  So we are not getting tired of fighting for freedom, for independence and for values. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  So I hope that people in the West will not get tired of supporting us as well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=99.42s)]
*  The only fatigue that I have observed so far is the sanctions fatigue in some European [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=107.3s)]
*  capitals who try to not, you know, not to avoid imposing the additional tough sanctions [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=112.86s)]
*  on Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=121.82s)]
*  But we are working with them and I hope I believe we will overcome that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=122.82s)]
*  We will help them to overcome that fatigue. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  Can you tell me which countries you're specifically talking about? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=132.1s)]
*  I'm very honest with you, but at this point I will remain a diplomat. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BZHo8T-lH4&t=135.42s)]
