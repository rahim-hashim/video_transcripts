Video Description: New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario has covered every major conflict and humanitarian crisis of her generation. In Ukraine, she captured an image that shocked the world and became one of the defining images of this war: a mother, her two children, and a friend, all killed by Russian mortar fire when fleeing Irpin, a village on the outskirts of Kyiv. In a week that saw four journalists killed while covering the war, she speaks with Hari Sreenivasan about what it means to witness history.

# NYT Photographer Lynsey Addario on the Photo Defining the War | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E)
*  So with all the politics and all the rhetoric, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=0.0s)]
*  actually documenting war is essential [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=2.5s)]
*  for those around the world to bear witness [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=4.96s)]
*  and for the history books. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=7.04s)]
*  And a warning that coming up, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=8.46s)]
*  you're about to see an image [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=9.8s)]
*  of the disturbing reality of war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=11.14s)]
*  New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=13.64s)]
*  Lindsay Adariel has covered every major conflict [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=16.44s)]
*  and humanitarian crisis of her generation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=19.28s)]
*  In Kiev, she captured an image which shocked the world, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=22.14s)]
*  and it's become one of the defining images of this war. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=25.28s)]
*  A mother, her two children, and a friend [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=28.88s)]
*  killed by Russian mortar fire when fleeing Erpym, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=31.68s)]
*  a village on the outskirts of the capital, Kiev. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=35.16s)]
*  In a week where four journalists have been killed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=38.22s)]
*  covering the Ukraine war, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=40.72s)]
*  she joins Hari Sreenivasan to explain [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=42.46s)]
*  what it means to actually witness history. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  Lindsay Adariel, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=49.94s)]
*  Now, as we tape this conversation, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=51.3s)]
*  a curfew that had been imposed on Kiev has just lifted, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  and you've been out there reporting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=57.04s)]
*  What have you seen? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, this morning we woke up [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  to the similar sounds of explosions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  So we found out that pieces of a rocket [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=66.44s)]
*  used to shoot down a Russian cruise missile [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=70.78s)]
*  had landed on top of a building in East Kiev. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=73.22s)]
*  So we went over there, and again, more lives destroyed, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=77.18s)]
*  more people's homes totally decimated, people displaced. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=82.0s)]
*  There were dozens of people being loaded onto buses [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=87.86s)]
*  in the freezing cold of the morning. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=90.42s)]
*  We went up into the building, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=93.46s)]
*  met with some families who were trying to collect [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=95.8s)]
*  whatever they could, salvage family photos, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=98.2s)]
*  whatever they possibly could from destroyed apartments. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=101.2s)]
*  When I came out of the building [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=105.3s)]
*  that was hit by the piece of rocket, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  there was a man leaning over a victim, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=111.92s)]
*  there was a white sheet over the victim, bloodied, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=116.8s)]
*  and he just was leaning over. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=121.2s)]
*  You could not see his face. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=124.74s)]
*  At one moment, I think he was almost holding hands [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  or just touching the victim, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=130.04s)]
*  and he didn't move for about 15 minutes, and he just wept. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=131.88s)]
*  And it was the most, I think it was so devastating [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=136.72s)]
*  because he was just motionless along with the victim, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=139.92s)]
*  and it was this moment of goodbye, it seemed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=143.78s)]
*  And then he just got up and kind of walked [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  about 15 feet away from us [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=150.78s)]
*  and just put his hands to his face, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=153.38s)]
*  and you can see his body convulsing from the back, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=155.26s)]
*  and he was limping. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=158.42s)]
*  So I imagine he was injured as well in the morning's attack, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  and then continued on. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=163.78s)]
*  And it's just like, this is another life destroyed, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=165.56s)]
*  and it just keeps happening every single day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  You have covered so many different conflicts before. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=172.56s)]
*  Is there something that sticks out to you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=175.04s)]
*  about what's been happening over the past few weeks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  that you've been here? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=179.68s)]
*  I mean, look, war is horrific. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=182.76s)]
*  I mean, to me, all wars have similarities, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=186.62s)]
*  and all wars have differences. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=189.72s)]
*  You see the most evil in humanity, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  but you also see the most incredible generosity and kindness [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  that comes out in people when they are vulnerable [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  and when they're at their most vulnerable moments. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=203.18s)]
*  So those things are similar across the board [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=206.22s)]
*  in most conflicts for me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  I think in Ukraine, the difference is this is a war [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=210.86s)]
*  that we sort of watched unfold in real time, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=215.02s)]
*  and no one could stop it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=217.82s)]
*  And so everyone was sort of incredulous [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=219.16s)]
*  when it actually began, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=221.66s)]
*  and Russians entered a sovereign country [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=223.1s)]
*  and just started bombarding civilians. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=225.66s)]
*  I think it's not often that you witness [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=227.82s)]
*  the intentional targeting of civilians that is so obvious, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=232.68s)]
*  that there is absolutely no denying it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=236.76s)]
*  And so I think that is rare. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=239.76s)]
*  I've covered conflicts before [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=242.12s)]
*  where I hear both sides of a story, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=243.72s)]
*  and people are trying to tell their narrative to me [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=247.2s)]
*  as a journalist, but I have to be on the ground [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=249.56s)]
*  and do the proper reporting. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=253.0s)]
*  This is a case where we are watching civilians [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=254.78s)]
*  be deliberately targeted, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=258.28s)]
*  really innocent people just uprooting their lives [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=260.68s)]
*  and fleeing more than I think 2 million people [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=263.28s)]
*  have fled already from Ukraine in a very short time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=265.76s)]
*  So things are happening very, very quickly as well. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=269.48s)]
*  I wanna go over a couple of the images [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=272.48s)]
*  that we have probably seen in the New York Times [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=274.46s)]
*  or maybe even on your Instagram recently. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=276.84s)]
*  One of them became quite famous, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=279.48s)]
*  and it was really kind of an intense image [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=281.82s)]
*  that viewer discretion advised [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  before we put this on the screen, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=287.54s)]
*  but it was an image of people who had just been victims [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  and they've been killed, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=293.98s)]
*  and it was a very rare decision by the Times [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=295.1s)]
*  to publish this as you saw it above the fold [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  on the newspaper. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've been doing this for 20 years, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=305.92s)]
*  and I know well that just because I've taken an image [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=310.22s)]
*  doesn't mean it will be published. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=314.14s)]
*  And this was a situation where I went [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=315.94s)]
*  to the civilian evacuation route out of European. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=319.38s)]
*  It's a suburb of Kiev, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  and I thought I was going to photograph civilians fleeing, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  images that we had seen in the media. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=330.14s)]
*  It was a very well-documented, well-known evacuation route. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=332.02s)]
*  And as soon as I got there, there was incoming artillery, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=335.94s)]
*  and it was sort of bracketed onto the evacuation route. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=340.5s)]
*  It started further away, got closer and closer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=344.36s)]
*  We were pinned down a lot of the time. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=347.88s)]
*  I kept diving for cover with my colleague, Andrei Dubchak, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=349.86s)]
*  and the security advisor for the New York Times. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=353.26s)]
*  And eventually a mortar, I think a mortar round [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=356.02s)]
*  or a tank round landed between me and the family. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=359.34s)]
*  It was a mother and two children and a church volunteer [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=363.42s)]
*  who were killed, ultimately killed before our eyes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=365.98s)]
*  And after those initial moments, it was very chaotic. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  It was very dusty, very emotional, of course, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  because we were trying to figure out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=376.98s)]
*  if we were injured ourselves. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=378.44s)]
*  There's a moment in the video where I asked Andrei [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  if I was bleeding in the neck [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=383.06s)]
*  because I felt the spray of gravel all over my neck, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=384.5s)]
*  and I didn't know if it was shrapnel or gravel. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  And so when we were able to run across the street, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=391.3s)]
*  we came upon these four bodies lying sort of almost [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=394.7s)]
*  as if they were spooning with their luggage [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=398.94s)]
*  and the little boy, I think the daughter or the son [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  with the backpack still on their back. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=408.06s)]
*  It just was so, it was almost vulgar, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=411.5s)]
*  the way that they were killed before our eyes, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=415.3s)]
*  these very innocent civilians. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=418.08s)]
*  And so once I photograph an image like that, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=420.18s)]
*  it then goes to the New York Times. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=425.41999999999996s)]
*  I send it to the New York Times, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=426.3s)]
*  and they have to make the very hard decision [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=427.64s)]
*  of whether to publish that image. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=430.09999999999997s)]
*  And this was a case where I'm so grateful [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=432.3s)]
*  that they were so brave and took the stand to publish it, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=435.12s)]
*  knowing that they were civilians deliberately targeted. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=438.46s)]
*  Do you think that we should see everything that you see, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=441.58s)]
*  or do you think that we should be shielded a little? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=443.78s)]
*  I don't think that people should see everything that I see [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=446.74s)]
*  because I see a lot of things that I think most people [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=449.97999999999996s)]
*  couldn't process. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=453.02s)]
*  But I do think in a situation like this image, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  it was not too graphic, it was not too bloody. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  It was a situation where I witnessed [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=466.46s)]
*  the entire event unfolding so I could give the backstory. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=468.32s)]
*  It was civilians deliberately being targeted [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=472.21999999999997s)]
*  on the days when President Putin was saying [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=476.9s)]
*  he was not targeting civilians. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=479.24s)]
*  So I think the time was essential. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=481.42s)]
*  I think the fact that I witnessed the run-up [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  and the fact that it wasn't too graphic, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=486.42s)]
*  yes, it was a horrible decision that the paper [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=488.5s)]
*  and that the editors had to make [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=492.5s)]
*  of whether to put an image out before they knew [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=495.06s)]
*  if the family members knew. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  And before, there's a lot involved in these decisions, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=498.90000000000003s)]
*  but I think ultimately everyone agreed. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=502.90000000000003s)]
*  And Sergei, the husband and father of those two children [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=505.44s)]
*  and the husband of Tatiana, his wife, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=509.06s)]
*  agreed that that image needed to be seen, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  that the world needed to see what was happening in Ukraine. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=514.54s)]
*  And so that also really helped [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=517.8s)]
*  in terms of justifying our decision. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=521.94s)]
*  Not that we need justification as journalists, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=524.64s)]
*  but for me as a mother and for me as a wife [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=526.74s)]
*  and for me as a photographer, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=529.86s)]
*  it is reassuring to know that he understood [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=531.88s)]
*  exactly why that image was important. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=536.1s)]
*  I think one other point that's really important is, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=539.9s)]
*  I have two kids, I have a 10-year-old [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=542.14s)]
*  and an almost three-year-old, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=544.7s)]
*  and my 10-year-old plays very violent video games sometimes [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=546.1s)]
*  that we obviously try to stop him from playing, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=550.1800000000001s)]
*  but I think, and the movies that are out in the public [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=553.1s)]
*  are so violent and graphic that I myself [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=556.58s)]
*  as a war photographer can't watch most [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=559.94s)]
*  of what comes out of Hollywood. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=561.98s)]
*  And so it's interesting to me [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=563.7s)]
*  that those movies are palatable [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=566.02s)]
*  and those video games are acceptable in society, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=568.1s)]
*  but reality is not. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=571.06s)]
*  Why is that okay? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=573.06s)]
*  Why is it okay that we have such a violent society [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=574.34s)]
*  and we have films and TV shows [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=578.02s)]
*  that are people killing each other left and right, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=580.42s)]
*  but the reality no one wants to see? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=582.9s)]
*  And so why is that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=584.9399999999999s)]
*  Because we need to see this reality so we can act on it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=586.38s)]
*  Some of the images that you made in Kiev [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=590.06s)]
*  that I wanna touch on, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=593.38s)]
*  one is just an incredibly poignant one [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=594.84s)]
*  of I think two or three children in a train, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=597.0s)]
*  and one of them has a teddy bear, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  and they have very different looks in their eyes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=601.2s)]
*  And while you're making that image, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=603.84s)]
*  when you just said to me that you're a mom of two, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=605.96s)]
*  you can see your own children in there, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=609.12s)]
*  and yet there are thousands and thousands of women [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=610.84s)]
*  and children who are getting on these trains [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=613.0400000000001s)]
*  and leaving their loved ones behind. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=614.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's every single day [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=618.4s)]
*  is just filled with devastation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=621.1600000000001s)]
*  And for every one of these families [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=623.12s)]
*  that's being torn apart, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=625.72s)]
*  I mean, an image that I keep seeing over and over [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=626.84s)]
*  is a father or husband saying goodbye [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=630.72s)]
*  to his wife or his partner and the children [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  and putting them on trains and sending them west [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=636.6s)]
*  because most of the men are staying to fight. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=638.96s)]
*  Some of the women are staying to fight, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  but the immediate sort of goal [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=643.0400000000001s)]
*  is to just get your family, get your children to safety. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=648.36s)]
*  So most people are just sort of throwing themselves [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=651.56s)]
*  on any train they can get on moving west. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=654.2399999999999s)]
*  And so often you see this sort of lonely father [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=657.28s)]
*  or husband just standing on the tracks [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=661.2399999999999s)]
*  as the train pulls away, crying, but trying not to cry [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=663.4s)]
*  because of course, everyone feels a bit of shame [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  for feeling so emotional, but it's happening every day [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  and you see these lonely men on the tracks watching [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=674.5999999999999s)]
*  their wives and their children depart. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=677.92s)]
*  You also made an image of, I think three or four women [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=680.44s)]
*  sitting in a van with rifles kind of getting at the ready. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  And it was just different types of faces that were there, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=687.32s)]
*  but I looked at that and didn't see the caption, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=690.0400000000001s)]
*  but these could have been your school teachers, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=692.8800000000001s)]
*  your nurses, CEOs, I don't know, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=695.0s)]
*  but they didn't look like people who were [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  by any stretch of the imagination, professional soldiers. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=700.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they were not. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=704.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, in fact, we were trying to get access [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=705.32s)]
*  to this base of volunteers. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=708.12s)]
*  It was in the first few days of the war, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=709.76s)]
*  there was this mass mobilization of civilians [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=711.48s)]
*  offering themselves up to fight. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=714.56s)]
*  And then I saw as we were waiting for permission [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=716.68s)]
*  to this base, I saw sort of a gaggle of women [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=719.2s)]
*  that were maybe six and they all had guns in their hand, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=722.04s)]
*  but they were still behind the fence [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=725.56s)]
*  and we're waiting and waiting for permission. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=727.16s)]
*  And finally it came through, but in that time, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=730.0s)]
*  they were transported to this van. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=732.4399999999999s)]
*  So when we got the permission, we ran onto the van [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=734.64s)]
*  and I started shooting and then I paused and I said, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=737.64s)]
*  do you speak English? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=742.48s)]
*  And the woman said, yes. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  I said, what's your name? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=744.88s)]
*  My name is Julia. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=745.84s)]
*  I'm a teacher. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=747.04s)]
*  And she started crying and I was shooting [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=748.48s)]
*  and I said, why are you crying? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=751.8s)]
*  And she said, I'm crying for my country. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=753.6s)]
*  And I said, are you crying because you're scared? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=756.76s)]
*  And she said, I'm crying because I'm scared, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=758.64s)]
*  but I'm crying for my country. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=760.24s)]
*  And you realize the beauty of Ukrainians [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=761.96s)]
*  is that there is no hesitation. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=765.8s)]
*  They have come out. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=769.7199999999999s)]
*  They believe they've had a taste [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=771.04s)]
*  of this freedom of democracy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=772.76s)]
*  They are out there. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  There is no turning back. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=775.92s)]
*  I have not met a single person [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  who doubts giving themselves to this fight. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=779.4799999999999s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=783.04s)]
*  I don't know how long ago it was, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=784.76s)]
*  but there's a shot that you have of a small child [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=786.16s)]
*  and it looks like it is in what looks like [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=789.12s)]
*  maybe a makeshift cardboard box slash crib [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  in the middle of a subway car. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=793.96s)]
*  And this is at a time when people were taking shelter [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  and refuge underground. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=798.96s)]
*  And it's just, it's sort of staggering to think [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=800.9200000000001s)]
*  that there are literally populations [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=806.84s)]
*  that are at least at one point headed underground [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  for physical safety of their families. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=811.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's an entire swaths of a city [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=814.48s)]
*  are living underground right now. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=819.0s)]
*  And in most major cities across Ukraine. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=820.52s)]
*  Have just shifted underground [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=824.52s)]
*  because the bombardment generally starts. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=826.0s)]
*  Not that it's quiet all day, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=828.84s)]
*  but it definitely intensifies [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=830.24s)]
*  at certain points throughout the night. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=832.88s)]
*  And I think a lot of these families [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=835.08s)]
*  just know they're safer underground. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=837.08s)]
*  And so, yeah, you go underground [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=839.12s)]
*  and people are on the subway platforms. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=841.36s)]
*  They're in the cars, babies, children living in [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=843.5600000000001s)]
*  on the subway cars in boxes. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=847.8000000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable because these are people [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=850.2s)]
*  who three weeks ago were living in a completely, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  absolutely normal lives. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=859.24s)]
*  Yeah, to your point above ground, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=861.04s)]
*  you have an image of an apartment building [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=862.56s)]
*  that just looks basically sheared off. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=864.6s)]
*  And you have one, I wanna say a woman [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=866.16s)]
*  that was in the balcony or was her balcony [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=868.4399999999999s)]
*  just kind of looking around [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=870.56s)]
*  and you see just all of the apartments around her [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=871.72s)]
*  are charred probably from the fires [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=874.28s)]
*  that were caused by whatever missile or rocket attack [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=876.76s)]
*  that hit that building. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=879.52s)]
*  And that doesn't look like it was a government building [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=880.96s)]
*  by any stretch. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=883.8000000000001s)]
*  It just looks like a residential condo complex. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=884.64s)]
*  No, I mean, residential buildings [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=887.2s)]
*  are being targeted daily now. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=889.08s)]
*  Every single day for the past, I don't know, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=890.64s)]
*  four or five days, we wake up, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=893.52s)]
*  we hear of several apartment buildings [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=895.24s)]
*  that have been targeted. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=897.12s)]
*  And there's this rhythm of people thrust awake [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=898.6s)]
*  in the middle of the night from an attack. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  Some people are killed, some people are injured, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=905.2s)]
*  collecting whatever belongings they can, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  trying to figure out where they will go next to sleep. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=911.16s)]
*  There are children, there are elderly, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=915.0s)]
*  people being rescued by firemen, emergency workers [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=916.52s)]
*  who are unbelievable. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=920.28s)]
*  So it's just this, now it's just repeating every single day. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=922.8s)]
*  I also wonder how the refugees that you're seeing today [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=926.88s)]
*  are perceived and treated by neighboring countries [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=931.68s)]
*  elsewhere in Europe versus some of the other war zones [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=935.5999999999999s)]
*  that you've been to, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=938.3599999999999s)]
*  where you realize that some of those refugees [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=939.64s)]
*  are not created warmly by the neighboring countries. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=942.56s)]
*  I think that's a great point. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=945.64s)]
*  I think it's a really good point. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=947.12s)]
*  I mean, I covered the Syrian refugee crisis. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=948.68s)]
*  I've covered refugees from Darfur, from South Sudan, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=951.56s)]
*  from all around the world. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you cover conflict, you cover refugees [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=956.56s)]
*  because it's a byproduct. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=960.28s)]
*  There is no conflict that doesn't have a surge of refugees [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=963.04s)]
*  because civilians all want to save their lives. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=965.76s)]
*  And I think it is heartbreaking. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=968.52s)]
*  It's as wonderful as it is that the world has come together [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=970.92s)]
*  to stand behind Ukraine and welcome Ukrainians across Europe. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=975.68s)]
*  It is heartbreaking that the same didn't happen [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=980.04s)]
*  for Syrian refugees, that there was not the same open arms. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=983.12s)]
*  There was not the same understanding [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=987.24s)]
*  of the devastation of that conflict. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=988.68s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=991.04s)]
*  because no one chooses to be a refugee. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=993.36s)]
*  No one chooses to leave his or her home. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=996.48s)]
*  People aren't going to seek a better life. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1000.0s)]
*  They're going to seek safety for their families, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  for their children, and to live out of a war zone. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1005.64s)]
*  And I think it's very important for people [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1009.04s)]
*  to use this opportunity to realize [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1010.6s)]
*  that refugees should be welcomed, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1013.08s)]
*  particularly if there's ongoing conflict in that country. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1016.16s)]
*  And it's not their choice to leave their countries. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1018.96s)]
*  What keeps you there? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1023.12s)]
*  What keeps you doing this? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1024.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1027.32s)]
*  I mean, I can ask my mother. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1028.16s)]
*  She keeps asking, what are you doing? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1029.72s)]
*  I just believe it's so important to bear witness to this, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1036.04s)]
*  to document, to provide a document [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1041.16s)]
*  to the world of what's happening. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1043.76s)]
*  It's a great honor to work for the New York Times [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1047.24s)]
*  because it's such an incredible publication [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1049.48s)]
*  that I know is read worldwide. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1052.28s)]
*  And yeah, I just keep thinking I have more work to do [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1054.68s)]
*  and I can do better work. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1058.76s)]
*  And so I haven't left yet, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1060.2s)]
*  but at some point I have to take a break. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1061.92s)]
*  How does it affect you when you hear of some of our colleagues [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1065.0800000000002s)]
*  who are injured or killed [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1069.04s)]
*  in these places that you're working? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1071.16s)]
*  I mean, when one of us is killed, it affects all of us. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1074.16s)]
*  I mean, this is a, you know, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1077.3200000000002s)]
*  it's a very tight community of war correspondents [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1079.3600000000001s)]
*  and photographers. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1082.3200000000002s)]
*  And even if we don't know each other, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1083.4s)]
*  you know, we're all doing the same things here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1086.2s)]
*  So it's, you know, a lot of this is luck. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1088.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's, you know, some take more risks than others, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1090.92s)]
*  but more or less we're in the same situation [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1093.96s)]
*  and we've covered the same wars for the last 20 years. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1096.2s)]
*  And I think, you know, we just realize [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1099.24s)]
*  how it could be any one of us. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1102.4s)]
*  And it's heartbreaking. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1106.1200000000001s)]
*  And of course we think, you know, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1107.24s)]
*  our condolences to their families and their loved ones [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1108.76s)]
*  and our gratitude for the work that they're doing [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1112.0s)]
*  because this is collective work. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1114.04s)]
*  You know, we each do our part [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1115.6399999999999s)]
*  and it creates a picture for the world. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1117.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think, you know, we need each other's coverage [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  and it's tragic. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1123.08s)]
*  Lindsay Adaria of the New York Times, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  joining us from Keefe tonight. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q9Ai1DXx_E&t=1127.56s)]
