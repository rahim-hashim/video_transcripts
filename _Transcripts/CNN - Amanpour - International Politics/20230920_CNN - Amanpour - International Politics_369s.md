# EXCLUSIVE Qatari Prime Minister on Mediating U.S.-Iran Prisoner Deal  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw)
*  Prime Minister, welcome back to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=2.4s)]
*  Tell us about this amazing deal that you were instrumental in helping to seal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=4.12s)]
*  What was it or what was the moment that you knew it was going to be possible to reach [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  a deal between Iran and the United States to free the prisoners? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=15.6s)]
*  Well first of all I would like to congratulate the families of the prisoners to have them [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=18.88s)]
*  back and seeing them and I hope all of them are in good health. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=23.76s)]
*  We always believe, we always have a faith and believe that we can help, we can facilitate [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=29.52s)]
*  especially humanitarian situations. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=36.36s)]
*  We've been through a lot of challenges throughout the negotiations. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=41.12s)]
*  Honestly, none of the parties was easy in the negotiation but we tried our best in order [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=44.04s)]
*  to create the trust between us and them and create the trust between them in order to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=50.86s)]
*  have this deal happening. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  It took us a month until we reached this agreement but we have seen the desire and determination [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=58.4s)]
*  of both parties to implement the agreement in good faith and this is something we commend [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=65.24s)]
*  both parties for doing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=69.16s)]
*  I mean good-ish faith, they weren't even together, right? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=70.96s)]
*  They weren't even the same hotels, you had to relay back and forth. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=73.52s)]
*  Well everything has its own challenges but at the end of the day results what matters [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=77.2s)]
*  and what matters now that the prisoners are back with their families. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=82.36s)]
*  As a human being, did you find it emotional when the whole world saw on live television [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  the Qatar Airways plane open the door and down they came? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Well we were so proud to see that Qatar helped in bringing those people back to their families [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=94.72s)]
*  definitely. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=99.64s)]
*  I mean all of us on all levels, whether from His Highness the Emir, myself, the entire government [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=100.64s)]
*  and the people of Qatar, we are so proud that Qatar could make such a thing. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=107.6s)]
*  Many people like to think that this could be the beginning of a rapprochement between [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=111.56s)]
*  Iran and the United States. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=115.92s)]
*  The US has ruled that out, maybe Iran has as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=117.92s)]
*  Nonetheless, do you think it's the beginning of a building block? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=121.0s)]
*  In other words, is there any thoughts that perhaps it could lead to a new nuclear deal? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Well look, Rissia, I cannot claim that this will lead to a nuclear deal but it's going [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=129.52s)]
*  definitely to lead to a better environment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  We've been doing this mediating between countries, mediating on different issues for decades [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=137.92s)]
*  now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=145.28s)]
*  And in our experience we know that in complex situations you need to unlock it by rebuilding [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=146.27999999999997s)]
*  the confidence between the parties. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  And I believe what happened yesterday actually was a great building block for rebuilding [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=154.27999999999997s)]
*  the confidence between the two countries. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  I hope both countries are believing that this will lead to a better environment to go for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=163.72s)]
*  an entire agreement on the nuclear issue and any other outstanding issue. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  At the end of the day, what we want for our region is stability. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Can I just ask you, you know there's been a lot of talk about the Iran-Saudi Arabia [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=181.56s)]
*  rapprochement through the auspices of China. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=188.4s)]
*  Even bigger, people have said, well maybe Iran and maybe Saudi Arabia and Israel, maybe [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=191.6s)]
*  there's a huge big Middle Eastern deal to be done. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=197.0s)]
*  Do you see the possibility of that in the near future? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=201.16s)]
*  Well definitely the Middle East and especially with us in the region went through the last [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=205.44s)]
*  couple of years. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=212.48s)]
*  Before that we were going through challenges, now we are going in a better positive environment [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=214.32s)]
*  of rapprochement. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=219.76s)]
*  We hear also about Israel, but from our perspective as state of Qatar we see that we don't have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=220.92s)]
*  a war with Israel as a region. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  The reason that we have the conflict with Israel is over the occupation of the Palestinian [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  territories. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=237.64s)]
*  And what we are asking for is the statehood for the Palestinians. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's what basically been mentioned in the Arab Peace Initiative that came out in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=242.68s)]
*  2001 and all Arab countries have adopted that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=249.0s)]
*  We believe to bring peace to the region the starting point should be between the Israeli [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=254.4s)]
*  and the Palestinians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=258.92s)]
*  Normalization agreement happening between countries is their sovereign decision at the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=260.84s)]
*  end of the day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=264.52s)]
*  No one has the right to question that, no one has the right to question our sovereign [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=265.96s)]
*  foreign policy decisions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=271.76s)]
*  But we think that from our perspective the Israeli issue is only the issue of the Palestinians. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=273.52s)]
*  And yet it seems that that issue is off the boiling point of front burner, it's just nobody [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=280.56s)]
*  is paying any attention to that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  And I want to ask you, many, even Americans I've talked to, feel that there is a sort [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=286.2s)]
*  of sucking sound as the United States pulls out of the Middle East. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=292.0s)]
*  Do you feel that the US is pulling back its influence and responsibility? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=296.76s)]
*  Well, I think that with what we have seen in the past couple of years, we have seen [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=301.76s)]
*  more and more engagement with the US. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=306.4s)]
*  We see their commitment to the defense of the Gulf region and the joint trainings are [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=308.4s)]
*  ongoing and we have a great military relationship with the US. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=313.56s)]
*  We've been doing a lot of work together at the air base hosting more than 10,000 US men [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=319.84s)]
*  and women in uniforms. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=325.56s)]
*  And we didn't see any changes in that happening. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=327.2s)]
*  We believe that, yes, the world is, I mean, they are busy with other things. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=332.56s)]
*  Like China, there's a sort of a shift towards China. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=337.72s)]
*  But also the Russian-Ukrainian war is something big that's happening to the world and affecting [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  the entire world. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=344.8s)]
*  I won't call it reprioritizing, but it's taking more time, of course, from them than the Middle East. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_7clKUXCbw&t=346.56s)]
