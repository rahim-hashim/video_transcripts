*  And Senator Sanders is joining [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=0.0s)]
*  the program from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=1.6s)]
*  Welcome back to our program, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  Senator. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=4.7s)]
*  So, we've laid out your [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  criticisms. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=7.66s)]
*  We've heard President Biden's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=8.5s)]
*  criticisms of the current [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=10.64s)]
*  military operation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  What is he doing, the president, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=14.14s)]
*  that he... [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  What do you want him to do that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  he hasn't done up until now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  Christian, we are looking right [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  now in Gaza at one of the worst [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=23.98s)]
*  humanitarian disasters in the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=27.52s)]
*  modern history of the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=29.58s)]
*  As you indicated, right now, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=35.62s)]
*  face starvation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=37.16s)]
*  Children are dying from malnutrition. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=38.76s)]
*  Eighty percent of the population [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=41.8s)]
*  has been displaced. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=43.34s)]
*  Over half the buildings have been [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  damaged or destroyed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=47.2s)]
*  And Israel continues to make it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=51.0s)]
*  difficult to get the kind of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  humanitarian aid that desperate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=55.54s)]
*  people need. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=57.92s)]
*  So, to my mind, the most [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=59.18s)]
*  important thing the United States [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  government can do is say to Mr. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  Netanyahu, you know what? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  You cannot continue this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=66.72s)]
*  disastrous, horrific war. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=68.42s)]
*  You cannot allow children by the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  thousands to face starvation or [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=72.52s)]
*  you're not getting another [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=75.22s)]
*  nickel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=76.12s)]
*  Now, I think one of the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=76.9s)]
*  incongruities that a lot of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=78.6s)]
*  people in America see is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=80.66s)]
*  everybody is criticizing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=83.2s)]
*  Netanyahu and then they're saying [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=84.56s)]
*  in the next word, oh, here, Mr. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu, here's another [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=87.6s)]
*  14 billion on top of the 3.5 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=88.9s)]
*  billion you got. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=90.56s)]
*  You're a terrible guy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=91.36s)]
*  You're doing terrible things. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  But here's your money. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=93.5s)]
*  I think our policy has got to be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  very clear. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=96.84s)]
*  Not another nickel for Netanyahu's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=97.54s)]
*  right-wing extremist government [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  while hundreds of thousands of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=103.78s)]
*  people in Gaza face starvation, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=105.68s)]
*  period. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=108.34s)]
*  Senator, can I ask you, when you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=109.68s)]
*  say not another nickel, do you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=110.94s)]
*  actually mean actual aid money or [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  do you mean the American weapons [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=115.66s)]
*  that are not nickels and dimes? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=118.64s)]
*  They are actual bombs and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=120.18s)]
*  artillery and ammunition. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=121.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  The idea that we have supplied [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=124.34s)]
*  and are continuing to supply [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  two thousand pound bombs which [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=128.28s)]
*  could wipe out an entire block [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=130.32s)]
*  and other military aid is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=132.38s)]
*  unacceptable. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=134.38s)]
*  Look, there is a terrible war [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=135.02s)]
*  going on which violates [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=137.56s)]
*  international law. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=139.16s)]
*  In fact, it is violating [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=140.3s)]
*  American law. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=141.72s)]
*  Let me tell you how. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  Foreign Assistance Act is very, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  very clear that if a country [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  blocks American humanitarian aid, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  no more funds for that country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=151.06s)]
*  Israel has blocked American [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian aid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=155.66s)]
*  So what I am saying right now, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  talk is cheap, but we cannot be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=158.5s)]
*  critical of Netanyahu and his [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=161.74s)]
*  right-wing extremists and at the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  same time give them money and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=164.74s)]
*  weapons to continue this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  terrible war. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  That's where the leverage is. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=168.78s)]
*  I suspect that President Biden [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=170.34s)]
*  is beginning to use that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  leverage in his discussions with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=174.88s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  What we have seen in the last [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=177.2s)]
*  week is a, we don't know exactly, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=179.26s)]
*  but an improvement in the number [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=182.2s)]
*  of trucks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=184.5s)]
*  The UN says now that over 200 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=185.14s)]
*  trucks got in yesterday. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=187.7s)]
*  That is an improvement. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=189.14s)]
*  But obviously you need 500 [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=190.94s)]
*  trucks, you need a thousand [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=192.74s)]
*  trucks, you need those trucks [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=193.78s)]
*  getting to the most desperate [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=195.04s)]
*  parts of Gaza where people are [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=197.48s)]
*  literally starving to death. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=199.68s)]
*  So we're seeing a little bit of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=201.12s)]
*  an improvement, but we have got [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=202.42s)]
*  to hold Israel accountable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  In my view, the leverage we have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=205.76s)]
*  is money, not another nickel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=208.2s)]
*  until Netanyahu changes his [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=210.7s)]
*  entire policy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=212.3s)]
*  Okay, so tell me how that works [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=214.14s)]
*  because in America we have the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  legislative process. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=217.5s)]
*  You are part of that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=218.54s)]
*  You know, a lot of this, I think, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=220.48s)]
*  is mandated by Congress and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=222.24s)]
*  approvals in aid packages. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=225.32s)]
*  And as you said, the law states [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=228.88s)]
*  that this amount of aid and stuff [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=231.16s)]
*  cannot go into in certain [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=234.5s)]
*  conditions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=235.96s)]
*  But on March 25th, the State [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=236.5s)]
*  Department said they found no [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  violations made by Israel, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=240.1s)]
*  either when it comes to the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=242.34s)]
*  conduct of the war or the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  provision of humanitarian [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=245.58s)]
*  assistance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, clearly you don't agree [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  with that, but what can you do [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  about it? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  This is exactly the problem. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=252.62s)]
*  You can't go around criticizing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=254.46s)]
*  Netanyahu, who clearly, clearly, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=256.16s)]
*  the language is clear, is in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=258.86s)]
*  violation of American law. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=260.52s)]
*  And not to say we have not found [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=262.86s)]
*  any reasons to deny aid. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=264.4s)]
*  That is nonsense. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  And the State Department has got [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=267.34s)]
*  to change its tune big time. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=268.58s)]
*  What's the process then? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=274.38s)]
*  If it wasn't... [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=275.73999999999995s)]
*  What is the process and what [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=277.12s)]
*  will be the straw that breaks [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=278.52s)]
*  the camel's back? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what the straw [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  will be, but here's where we are [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=283.62s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=284.85999999999996s)]
*  As you know, there is a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  supplemental bill that passed [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=287.02s)]
*  the Senate against my vote. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=289.46s)]
*  I think, if I'm not mistaken, I [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=290.96s)]
*  was the only member of the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  Senate to vote against that, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  specifically because of $14 [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  billion in there going to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  Israel, including $10 billion, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=301.76000000000005s)]
*  $10 billion for unfettered [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=304.36s)]
*  military aid. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=305.6s)]
*  Another amount of money went for [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=306.6s)]
*  the defense, for the Iron [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Dove and so forth, what I can [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=309.24s)]
*  live with. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=310.54s)]
*  But the idea of giving Netanyahu [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=311.54s)]
*  another $10 billion to continue [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=313.12s)]
*  this war seems to me to be [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=315.24s)]
*  totally absurd. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=316.88s)]
*  That bill is now in the House of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=318.42s)]
*  Representatives. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=320.38s)]
*  God knows what goes on in the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=321.38s)]
*  House of Representatives if [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=322.74s)]
*  they're able to do anything. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=324.18s)]
*  But that is where it is right [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=325.62s)]
*  now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  And I would hope that my [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  colleagues in the House will say [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=328.78000000000003s)]
*  no, Israel does not deserve [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=329.78000000000003s)]
*  another nickel at this point. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7S3aXA1Rwo&t=331.72s)]
