Video Description: Christiane is in Paris, where President Macron has called Vladimir Putin to demand an immediate ceasefire. Macron also spoke with President Zelensky as Ukraine held off Russian forces for a fifth day. Massive E.U. and U.S. sanctions are tearing into Russiaâ€™s economy and sending the ruble plunging, even as delegations from Moscow and Kyiv are meeting for negotiations at the Belarus border. Putin's war seems not to be proceeding as far and as fast as planned. But there is little hope for an early resolution to the conflict. On Sunday, Putin put his nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. David Petraeus, a former commander of U.S. Central Command and director of the CIA, joins the show to discuss.

# David Petraeus: Putin's War in Ukraine Is "Going Terribly for Him" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA)
*  In truth, it's going terribly for him, I think, across the board. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=0.0s)]
*  At the strategic level, he has essentially united most of the rest of the world, the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=5.32s)]
*  U.S., NATO, the EU, many other countries not part of those organizations, to have Germany [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=11.6s)]
*  over the weekend commit 100 billion euros in a one-time supplemental for defense, put [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=18.54s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 certification on hold, provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, keeping in mind [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=25.28s)]
*  that the first contribution they made was Kevlar helmets, and to commit to immediately [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=31.8s)]
*  spending 2 percent of GDP on defense when they weren't even at 1.5 percent of GDP. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=38.28s)]
*  It's extraordinary, really very, very significant. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=45.16s)]
*  And then on the battlefield, it's going terribly. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  They have a flawed operational concept, proceeding along seven different axes of advance, not [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=52.26s)]
*  waiting the main effort on Kiev, where, of course, the main objective is to topple President [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=58.62s)]
*  Putin and his government and to replace it with one that is pro-Russian. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=64.22s)]
*  They haven't achieved air-ground integration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=70.56s)]
*  They haven't employed their cyber capabilities all that effectively. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=72.98s)]
*  They're not performing adequate logistics. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=77.02s)]
*  And they haven't even achieved combined arms. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=79.02s)]
*  In other words, infantry, armor, and artillery all together. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  And they're facing a citizenry that universally hates them with forces that are fighting on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=85.14s)]
*  their homeland, home-field advantage, know the terrain and the people, and the citizens [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=92.74s)]
*  themselves, many of them volunteering to fight the Russians. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=99.94s)]
*  So you noted that I was part of an invasion force when I was a two-star general. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine going into a country where everyone, again, wants to take up arms against [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=109.7s)]
*  you as opposed to being applauded, as we were at the beginning. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=115.14s)]
*  I mean, we were seen as an army of liberation at the beginning in Iraq because no one loved [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=118.62s)]
*  Saddam Hussein. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=124.58s)]
*  They hated him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=125.58s)]
*  Of course, an army of liberation can become an army of occupation pretty quickly if you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=126.58s)]
*  don't watch out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=131.26s)]
*  And we learned some tough lessons there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=132.26s)]
*  But I cannot imagine a more difficult situation for the Russians on the ground. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=134.7s)]
*  They're now going to be joined by the Belarusians, who are less competent even than they are, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=140.89999999999998s)]
*  noting that, again, the Russian performance has been truly underwhelming and the Ukrainian [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  performance has been extraordinary. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=151.66s)]
*  And here I should also note just the incredible leadership of President Zelensky. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=154.26s)]
*  As you will recall, he was a comedian playing the president on television. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  He got elected president. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  No one really knew what to expect. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=164.78s)]
*  And here he is providing enormous energy, example, inspiration, and very competent leadership [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=166.9s)]
*  despite being target number one in his family, target number two. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQbkqmUHkA&t=174.78s)]
