Video Description: As the deadline for the UK leaving the EU fast approaches, the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon is in the unusual position of seeing the country she leads being dragged out of the EU, despite Scottish people favoring remaining in the union. She speaks with Michel Martin in New York about Brexit, as well as her own – so far unrealized – desire for Scotland’s independence from the UK.

# First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon Discusses Brexit  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [August 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk)
*  We turn next to a small nation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=0.0s)]
*  caught in the middle of an [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=2.1s)]
*  enormous tug of war and to the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=3.4s)]
*  woman leading the defense. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=5.44s)]
*  She is Nicola Sturgeon, well [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=7.74s)]
*  known as the first minister of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  Scotland, one of only a handful [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=10.94s)]
*  of female heads of government [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=12.94s)]
*  around the world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=14.64s)]
*  And since the U.K. voted for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=15.94s)]
*  Brexit back in 2016, Scotland [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  has been caught up in this [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=20.64s)]
*  crisis against its will. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=22.14s)]
*  It voted overwhelmingly to stay [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=24.1s)]
*  in the E.U. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Nicola Sturgeon has been a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=27.7s)]
*  leading voice for a second [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=29.1s)]
*  referendum on E.U. membership. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  And she's doing everything that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=32.7s)]
*  she can to make sure her economy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=34.5s)]
*  survives Brexit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=36.64s)]
*  And that mission has brought her [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=38.2s)]
*  to the United States, where [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=39.84s)]
*  Brexit is an ongoing topic of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=41.34s)]
*  fascination and some confusion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=43.0s)]
*  Our Michelle Martin caught up [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=45.34s)]
*  with Sturgeon in New York. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  First Minister, thank you so [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=49.14s)]
*  much for joining us. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=50.14s)]
*  You're very welcome. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=51.14s)]
*  It's lovely to be here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=52.14s)]
*  I think most Americans know that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=53.14s)]
*  Scotland has a long and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  fruitful, close relationship [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  with the United States, both [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  culturally and economically, and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=59.6s)]
*  lots of other ways. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  But I just wonder if there's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=63.1s)]
*  something about the tone of the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  current administration that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=65.9s)]
*  concerns you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=66.9s)]
*  You probably heard some of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=67.9s)]
*  president's State of the Union [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=69.7s)]
*  address. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=70.8s)]
*  And in the very first couple of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=71.8s)]
*  words, he talked about putting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=73.04s)]
*  America's interests first. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=74.04s)]
*  And I wonder if there's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=75.2s)]
*  something that concerns you that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=76.2s)]
*  you felt a need to address while [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=77.2s)]
*  you're here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=78.2s)]
*  Well, look, I think it's no [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=79.2s)]
*  secret that I'm not aligned [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=80.94s)]
*  politically with the current [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=83.54s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=84.94s)]
*  We disagree and differ on many [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=86.8s)]
*  things. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=89.7s)]
*  But as you see, Scotland and the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  US have a very strong and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=93.0s)]
*  longstanding relationship. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=94.6s)]
*  And that relationship endures [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  regardless of who occupies the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=98.1s)]
*  office of president or first [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=100.0s)]
*  minister of Scotland. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=101.2s)]
*  I suppose the timing of my visit [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=103.0s)]
*  is perhaps more to do with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=104.5s)]
*  developments in the UK than in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=105.7s)]
*  the US. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=108.0s)]
*  Brexit, of course, the UK [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=108.5s)]
*  leaving the European Union, is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=110.4s)]
*  an issue that is occupying much [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=112.8s)]
*  of our thinking. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=114.9s)]
*  And I want to make sure that the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=116.0s)]
*  rest of the world knows that not [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=118.9s)]
* withstanding Brexit, Scotland [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  remains open for business. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Scotland didn't vote to leave the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=124.0s)]
*  EU. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  That's something that's happening [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  to us against our will. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=127.0s)]
*  But we want to make sure that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=129.1s)]
*  other countries know that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  Scotland remains open and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=131.8s)]
*  welcoming. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=132.9s)]
*  And we want to attract businesses [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=133.5s)]
*  and individuals to come and live [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=135.0s)]
*  and work in our country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=136.6s)]
*  One reason that some Americans [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=137.6s)]
*  are very interested in Brexit, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=140.0s)]
*  apart from just all the obvious, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  is that they saw it as kind of a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=143.8s)]
*  precursor to what happened in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=144.9s)]
*  the United States with the rise [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=146.3s)]
*  of Donald Trump as president. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  What is your view about what [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=150.4s)]
*  led to Brexit? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=152.0s)]
*  I think that some of the factors [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  behind Brexit are probably the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=154.9s)]
*  same factors that perhaps were [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=157.5s)]
*  behind the election of Donald [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=159.8s)]
*  Trump as president of the US. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=161.4s)]
*  Obviously, there are different [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=163.1s)]
*  situations and different [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=164.5s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=165.9s)]
*  But in the UK, I think the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=167.0s)]
*  Brexit vote ironically wasn't [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=168.8s)]
*  entirely to do with the European [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=172.4s)]
*  Union and the UK's membership of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=174.7s)]
*  the European Union. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=176.6s)]
*  Many people who voted to leave [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=177.6s)]
*  the EU were voting against the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=179.7s)]
*  status quo because there is [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=181.6s)]
*  concern, understandable concern, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  in the UK about rising levels of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=186.6s)]
*  inequality and poverty, people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=189.2s)]
*  feeling as if the status quo is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  not serving them well. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  That sometimes manifests itself [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  in a view that immigration is to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=197.5s)]
*  blame for that and we need to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=200.2s)]
*  reduce the numbers of people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=201.5s)]
*  coming to live in our country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=202.7s)]
*  And I guess some of those same [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=203.8s)]
*  factors would it play in the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=205.0s)]
*  election of Donald Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, you've been very blunt [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=208.3s)]
*  about saying that the UK is not [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  ready, that the May government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=211.9s)]
*  is not ready to meet this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=213.8s)]
*  deadline. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=216.0s)]
*  What should happen now in your [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=216.4s)]
*  view? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  The Prime Minister, Teresa May, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  in my view, should ask Europe [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  for an extension of the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  deadline because after two and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  a half years, she and her [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=225.3s)]
*  government have been completely [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=226.9s)]
*  incapable of coming up with a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=228.9s)]
*  plan to leave the EU in an [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=230.8s)]
*  orderly, well managed fashion. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=233.2s)]
*  So the risk now is that we leave [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=235.2s)]
*  at the end of March with no [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=237.7s)]
*  agreement in place and that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=239.1s)]
*  would have quite catastrophic [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  effects for almost every aspect [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  of life in the UK. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=244.7s)]
*  And even if an agreement is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=246.39999999999998s)]
*  struck in the next couple of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  weeks, we're running out of time [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  to do all of the practical [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=250.5s)]
*  things to put that agreement [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=251.7s)]
*  into effect. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=253.1s)]
*  And in my view, because there is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  no agreement about how to leave [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=256.4s)]
*  the European Union in the UK, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=257.8s)]
*  we should put the issue back to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=259.9s)]
*  the people in another referendum. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  But what would that accomplish [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=263.1s)]
*  though? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=264.20000000000005s)]
*  Because it's my understanding [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=264.70000000000005s)]
*  that we've asked whether there's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=265.5s)]
*  buyers remorse about this and it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  appears that it's not so much [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=269.1s)]
*  that there's buyers remorse is [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  that people are dug in, that the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=272.5s)]
*  people who were against it are [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  still against it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  They're even more against it now [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=275.6s)]
*  and the people who were for it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=276.8s)]
*  are just mad that it hasn't [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=277.8s)]
*  happened yet. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  So what would another referendum [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=279.5s)]
*  accomplish? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  There's some truth in what [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=281.3s)]
*  you've just said there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=282.8s)]
*  Opinion polls would suggest that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  opinion is still quite evenly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=285.5s)]
*  balanced, although they would [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=286.6s)]
*  also suggest that if there was [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=288.5s)]
*  another referendum, the outcome [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  probably would be to remain in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=292.0s)]
*  the EU. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=294.2s)]
*  And I guess in another [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=294.7s)]
*  referendum, young people who, by [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=296.0s)]
*  and large, wanted to stay in the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=299.3s)]
*  EU might be more likely to vote [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=301.3s)]
*  than they were in the first [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=303.2s)]
*  referendum. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=304.4s)]
*  So the idea is that people are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=304.9s)]
*  better educated now than they [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=307.1s)]
*  were before? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=308.6s)]
*  Ironically. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=309.7s)]
*  Or is it that more people are [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=310.3s)]
*  aware of what the stakes are and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=311.7s)]
*  would participate? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=313.5s)]
*  A bit of both. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=314.0s)]
*  I think people are more aware of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=314.3s)]
*  the stakes and would participate. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=315.4s)]
*  I think others are undoubtedly [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=316.7s)]
*  more informed about the downsides [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=319.1s)]
*  and people have seen the mess [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=321.7s)]
*  that's been made of the process [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=323.7s)]
*  of Brexit since the vote. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=325.2s)]
*  I don't think there's any room [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=326.4s)]
*  for complacency in any electoral [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=328.0s)]
*  contest, whether it's a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=329.8s)]
*  referendum or an election. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=330.8s)]
*  You have to make a case and you [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  have to win that case. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  But I do think that there is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=334.9s)]
*  every likelihood the result would [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=337.5s)]
*  be different and people would [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=339.8s)]
*  opt now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=341.0s)]
*  Ironically, people are much more [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=341.7s)]
*  informed about the issues around [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=343.7s)]
*  this than they were before they [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  voted. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=347.0s)]
*  And so what role does [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=347.4s)]
*  independence play in this? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=348.2s)]
*  I think people may remember that [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  there was a referendum on [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=350.6s)]
*  independence and that Scotland [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=351.8s)]
*  voted against it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=353.2s)]
*  It was a very spirited debate. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=354.5s)]
*  I don't know campaign is the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=357.5s)]
*  right word. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=359.0s)]
*  It was a very spirited campaign. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=359.3s)]
*  Unlike the Brexit vote, people [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=361.1s)]
*  really got into the issues before [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=363.0s)]
*  the vote. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=365.9s)]
*  So people voted knowing what all [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=366.3s)]
*  of the ins and outs and the pros [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=368.3s)]
*  and the cons were. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=370.3s)]
*  But to my understand, part of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=371.5s)]
*  the reason that people voted [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=373.8s)]
*  against it was that they wanted [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=374.8s)]
*  to stay within the EU. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=375.8s)]
*  Ironically, I use the word [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=377.3s)]
*  ironic again. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=378.8s)]
*  In the referendum, independence [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=379.5s)]
*  campaign, one of the arguments [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  that was made by those who were [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=384.6s)]
*  against independence was if [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=386.3s)]
*  Scotland voted to be independent, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=387.7s)]
*  we would be thrown out of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=389.7s)]
*  European Union because the UK is [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  the member state and we would [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=393.5s)]
*  have to reapply for membership. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=394.8s)]
*  And that did scare some people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=397.1s)]
*  And here we are four years later [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=399.7s)]
*  because we're not independent. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=402.1s)]
*  We're being taken out of the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  European Union. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=405.0s)]
*  So that undoubtedly brings the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=406.1s)]
*  issue of independence back to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=407.8s)]
*  the fore in many people's minds. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=409.7s)]
*  We are in this position because [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=412.3s)]
*  we're not independent. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=414.2s)]
*  62% of people in Scotland voted [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=415.6s)]
*  to remain in the EU. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=418.2s)]
*  And yet in a matter of weeks, we [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  could be outside the EU. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=421.3s)]
*  So that democratic deficit that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=423.1s)]
*  Scotland faces as being part of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=425.7s)]
*  the UK undoubtedly makes many [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=427.2s)]
*  people want to look again at the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  issue of Scotland becoming an [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=431.1s)]
*  independent country. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=432.3s)]
*  And what about you? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=433.0s)]
*  Are you looking again at the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=433.8s)]
*  prospect of or supporting [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=435.8s)]
*  another referendum on Scottish [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=437.3s)]
*  independence? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=438.7s)]
*  I think there will be another [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=439.2s)]
*  independence referendum. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=440.3s)]
*  And when that happens, I think [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=441.5s)]
*  Scotland this time will vote to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  be independent and that will be [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=444.2s)]
*  a way of us then being able to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=446.7s)]
*  protect our place in Europe and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=448.2s)]
*  make sure that the decisions [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  that influence the direction of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  our country are taken in Scotland, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=454.1s)]
*  not in London. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=455.5s)]
*  The timing of that is yet to be [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=457.8s)]
*  determined. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there's a lot of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=460.7s)]
*  concern about the Brexit process [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=462.0s)]
*  just now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=463.7s)]
*  And as First Minister of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=464.1s)]
*  Scotland, I've said that I'll [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=465.6s)]
*  set out my view on the timing of [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=467.1s)]
*  another independence referendum [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  in the next few weeks once we [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  see how this Brexit process [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=472.3s)]
*  finally plays out. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=474.6s)]
*  But I'm pressing the question [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=475.6s)]
*  because it sounds to me as though [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=476.70000000000005s)]
*  you're saying that Scotland has [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=478.0s)]
*  had enough. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=479.1s)]
*  So no matter what Britain decides [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=479.6s)]
*  to do, Scotland wants to be [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=481.70000000000005s)]

*  Well, what I'm saying is I think [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=494.3s)]
*  there will be another independence [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=495.5s)]
*  and I think there should be [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=497.1s)]
*  another independence referendum. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=497.9s)]
*  I'm not yet certain of exactly [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=499.9s)]
*  when that should happen because [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=502.1s)]
*  right now, a few weeks from [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=504.0s)]
*  Brexit, we don't know whether the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=505.8s)]
*  UK will leave with a deal or [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=507.3s)]
*  leave without a deal or perhaps [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=509.4s)]
*  not leave at all. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=510.9s)]
*  There could be another general [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=512.3s)]
*  election in the UK because of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=513.3s)]
*  this chaos. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=515.2s)]
*  There might be another [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=515.7s)]
*  referendum on the issue of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=516.2s)]
*  European Union membership. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=518.4s)]
*  So I think we need to just wait [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=520.1s)]
*  and see a little bit about what's [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=521.3s)]
*  going to happen on these things [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=522.9s)]
*  before I come to a view on when [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=524.5s)]
*  the right time for an independence [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=527.0s)]
*  referendum would be. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=528.7s)]
*  Do you think in, I'm not quite sure [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=529.5s)]
*  what time frame, three years, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=531.8s)]
*  five, that Scotland will be [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=533.8s)]
*  applying to the EU as an [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=535.5s)]
*  independent nation? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=536.8s)]
*  I would love to think so and I [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=537.6s)]
*  think it will. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=539.3s)]
*  I'm not going to put a particular [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=540.0s)]
*  time scale on it right now, but [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=542.0s)]
*  in the not too distant future, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=543.7s)]
*  I think Scotland will be an [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=546.2s)]
*  independent country looking to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=547.4s)]
*  join the EU as an independent [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=548.8s)]

*  far away from here. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=554.4s)]
*  So in the time we have left, I [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=555.3s)]
*  did want to ask a little bit [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=557.0s)]

*  people's mindset on it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=593.1s)]

*  support women into leadership [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=598.6s)]

*  hopefully not very many people [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=611.7s)]
*  do, that women are somehow less [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=612.8s)]
*  capable of being in senior [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=614.8s)]

*  I know that you had meetings with [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=742.0999999999999s)]
*  him while this matter was still [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=743.3s)]
*  being sort of investigated. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=744.9s)]
*  Is that leading by example? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=746.1999999999999s)]
*  I can't go into the detail of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  that because it is a criminal [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  proceeding. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=752.0999999999999s)]
*  But what I see and what I've [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=753.4s)]
*  always sought to act on as well [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=754.9s)]
*  as talk about is the fact that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=758.9s)]
*  nobody should be given special [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  treatment because of their [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=762.8s)]
*  seniority or their position. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=763.9s)]
*  And we're sitting here talking [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=765.5999999999999s)]
*  about this in itself as evidence [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=767.0s)]
*  that it wasn't simply brushed [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=769.5s)]
*  under the carpet because of the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=771.5s)]
*  identity of the person involved. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=773.0s)]
*  And that's what I think is [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=774.9s)]
*  important. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=775.8s)]
*  And, you know, as I see, I can't [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=776.3s)]
*  go into the detail of any of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=777.6999999999999s)]
*  this because of the circumstances [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=778.9s)]
*  of it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=780.9s)]
*  But nobody should be above [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=781.3s)]
*  accountability for these [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=783.3s)]
*  issues, whether it's, you know, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=784.6s)]
*  ahead of a government or whoever. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=786.0s)]
*  When complaints come forward, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=788.6s)]
*  they must be treated properly [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=790.6s)]
*  and investigated properly. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=792.6s)]
*  And that's the important [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=793.9s)]
*  principle that I advocate and [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=795.1s)]
*  always will. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you feel as a woman leader [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=797.9s)]
*  yourself and as I said, one of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=799.6s)]
*  the very few, that you have some [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=800.7s)]
*  special responsibility here, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=802.0s)]
*  that you're under special [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=803.7s)]
*  scrutiny here? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=804.3000000000001s)]
*  What is your special [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=804.8000000000001s)]
*  responsibility when it comes to [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=805.7s)]
*  this? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=807.0s)]
*  I think it is to speak up and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=807.6s)]
*  ensure that women are taken [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=810.5s)]
*  seriously and that women are [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=812.7s)]
*  not automatically disbelieved [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=814.2s)]
*  and that we have systems in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=816.4000000000001s)]
*  place that allow concerns and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=818.9000000000001s)]
*  complaints to be properly dealt [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=820.6s)]
*  with. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=822.3000000000001s)]
*  And if we fall short on those, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=822.5s)]
*  to address that and make sure [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=823.9000000000001s)]
*  we get it right in future. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=825.2s)]
*  And as a woman, I feel very [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=828.1s)]
*  strongly about these issues and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=829.4000000000001s)]
*  I feel a responsibility on these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=831.5s)]
*  issues. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=834.3000000000001s)]
*  But it can't just be the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=834.8000000000001s)]
*  responsibility of women. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=837.5s)]
*  You know, often here we're [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=838.6s)]
*  talking about the behaviour and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=839.6s)]
*  the conduct of men and men have [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=840.7s)]
*  to take ownership and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=842.4s)]
*  responsibility for that as well. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=844.0s)]
*  And you know, that's something [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=846.8s)]
*  that I think we shouldn't lose [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=848.0s)]
*  sight of. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=850.1999999999999s)]
*  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=851.3s)]
*  thank you so much for speaking [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=852.5s)]
*  to us. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPlIyZfVyFk&t=853.3s)]
