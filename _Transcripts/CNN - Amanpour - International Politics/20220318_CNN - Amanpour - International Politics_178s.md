# Victor Gao: "China's on the Side of Peace" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro)
*  So now let me ask you this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=0.0s)]
*  China clearly must be worried [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=2.24s)]
*  that any perception of tilting to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=5.28s)]
*  or doing business with Russia [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=8.88s)]
*  at this particular moment [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=11.58s)]
*  where there's global sanctions, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=12.82s)]
*  I want to just play this soundbite [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=14.76s)]
*  by the spokeswoman for the Biden administration [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=18.02s)]
*  about what might happen to China [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=21.62s)]
*  if indeed there's any connection economically [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=23.86s)]
*  with Russia at this time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=27.16s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=28.34s)]
*  If China were to decide to be an economic provider [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=29.56s)]
*  or to take additional steps there to Russia, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=33.26s)]
*  they only make up 15% or 15 to 20% of the world's economy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=36.04s)]
*  The G7 countries make up more than 50%. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  So there are a range of tools at our disposal [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=43.62s)]
*  in coordination with our European partners [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=45.84s)]
*  should we need to use them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=48.82s)]
*  So Victor Gao, she's basically alluding to possible sanctions, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=50.16s)]
*  secondary sanctions and the like against China. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Is that a price China is willing to pay [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=57.42s)]
*  for backing up what President Xi called [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=60.22s)]
*  his friend with no limits, President Putin? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  First of all, I think Ms. Psaki's estimation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=66.6s)]
*  or numbers are not accurate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  China now accounts for about 18% [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=71.4s)]
*  of the total economy in the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=73.98s)]
*  Secondly, allow me to remind all of us [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=76.48s)]
*  that China, Russia normalized their relations back in 1989 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=79.48s)]
*  before the collapse of the former Soviet Union. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  It is already 33 years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  And over these three decades, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=89.98s)]
*  China and Russia have been respecting each other. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=92.14s)]
*  The two peoples have dealt with each other with equality, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=94.62s)]
*  with mutual respect and China-Russian trade [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  has been in the range of more than 180 billion US dollars. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=101.98s)]
*  It's all comprehensive. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=108.86s)]
*  It covers a whole range of things. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  How could anyone in the world today [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=113.52s)]
*  expect that they could bring this China-Russian trade [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=116.22s)]
*  to a halt? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=120.26s)]
*  No, this is not the right thing to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=121.3s)]
*  How can anyone expect that they can disrupt [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  the people-to-people exchanges [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=127.5s)]
*  between China and Russia today? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=129.64s)]
*  No, this is really not the right thing to do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=132.44s)]
*  Don't sabotage international trade by sanctioning China, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=135.58s)]
*  especially because China has now the rare asset [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=139.9s)]
*  of having good channels of communication with Russia [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=144.1s)]
*  on the one hand and with Ukraine on the other hand. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=146.74s)]
*  And China does not have a vested interest at all [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=150.34s)]
*  in the outcome of this war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=154.34s)]
*  China is on the side of peace [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=156.48s)]
*  rather than having a vested interest [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  in promoting war in Ukraine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzNS52tsro&t=161.06s)]
