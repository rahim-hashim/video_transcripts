# Russian Propagandists Are Starting to See the Truth Fmr. Zelensky Adviser  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8)
*  Yulia Mendel was President Zelensky's press secretary before Russia's invasion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=0.0s)]
*  And in her new book, The Fight of Our Lives, she details her experience in government [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=5.28s)]
*  and life under Russian occupation. She joins Walter Isaacson to discuss the recent advances [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=10.4s)]
*  and her time with Zelensky. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=16.4s)]
*  Yulia Mendel, welcome to the show. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=19.36s)]
*  Walter, it's my pleasure. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=23.04s)]
*  You have a great new book, yeah, but let me start with the news, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=25.52s)]
*  which is more than 1,100 square miles of territory have been recaptured by the Ukrainians [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  from the Russians. Can you give us the latest of what that feels like in Ukraine now? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=36.8s)]
*  Well, Ukrainians are really celebrating their recent developments and really are very proud [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=42.64s)]
*  of our Ukrainian army and volunteers and all those people who devoted their life to help [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Ukrainian army regain our Ukrainian territories. From what I've heard, over 300 of settlements [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=54.48s)]
*  have been returned back to Ukraine. And it's amazing how Ukrainians are actually resuming [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  the life there. The biggest postal services already are returning to the settlements that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  just have been recaptured and are fully destroyed. Ukrainians making connection, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  trying already some rebuilds, people are coming back. We really want to return our life back that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=78.8s)]
*  Russia has so cruelly taken away from us on February 24th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=86.32s)]
*  One of the reasons that offensive succeeded is there was sort of a fake, it seems, as if they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  were going to go to the southern region of Kherson, which is where you're from. And there's still [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=98.16s)]
*  500,000 people there, including people I'm sure you know and your relatives, who are under [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=103.36s)]
*  Russian occupation there. Tell me what's happening in that region. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=110.24s)]
*  Well, to be frank, I'm talking a lot to people who are under Russian occupation. And believe me, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=114.88s)]
*  it's always causing a lot of emotions and tears because people just are praying there for Ukrainian [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=120.72s)]
*  army to return. In fact, you are right, I'm from that region and I spent my childhood in one of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=127.52s)]
*  villages, it is named Oleksandrivka. And I remember myself being a small girl going to the local [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  library, reading the books, eating cherries, apricots, you know. And now there is no this village [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=140.16s)]
*  anymore at all in general. My grandmother, she's a survivor and she actually spent a lot of time [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=146.8s)]
*  under Russian shelling. She was sitting in the basement having a wound in her leg and just [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=154.0s)]
*  hearing all this shelling, destroying her home, destroying her garden. She was lucky to come to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=159.12s)]
*  Kiev, we are taking care about her. But the situation there is very sorrowful. I know that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=165.44s)]
*  Ukrainian authorities are not giving up and Kherson region had five settlements liberated from Russians [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=170.96s)]
*  and furthermore, they have delayed the fake referenda for the second time already. And this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=178.8s)]
*  is already a big sign that they understand that Ukrainian army is not going to stop. But also some [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=186.24s)]
*  Russian journalists go to online social media and they say why on earth we need Kherson? People don't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  support us here, which is a great sign because these are Russian propagandists and they already [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  start seeing the truth. And are they right? There's no support whatsoever now for Russia in that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=206.56s)]
*  region of the Kherson? It is no, it is no support. Of course, there are some, you know, everywhere, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=212.88s)]
*  few people maybe who maybe were believing in this Russian propaganda. But the difficulty with the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=220.56s)]
*  Kherson region was that this is the only region that borders Crimea, the peninsula that Russia [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=227.84s)]
*  annexed back in 2014. And this means that Russians are getting there more and more, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=233.92s)]
*  you know, absolutely openly through the Crimean breach from Russia. And that's why there are so [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=239.2s)]
*  many of them there that it was very difficult for the Ukrainian army at the very beginning to stand [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  for that land. So ordinary Ukrainians, they are pretty well standing against Russian occupation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=250.32s)]
*  in different ways. They were protesting a lot and I had friends protesting there a lot. And there are [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=256.56s)]
*  a lot of partisans and they're doing big things there, starting from blowing up the cars of those [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=262.72s)]
*  who collaborate with Russia or of Russian leaders. And even spreading the Ukrainian flag everywhere [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=270.48s)]
*  on the city. And the more this Ukrainian flag is spread, you know, just put on the fences or, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=278.16s)]
*  you know, put on their houses somewhere, the more Russians are disturbed because they do not know [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=284.48s)]
*  how many partisans are there in Kherson. You know, reading your wonderful book about your [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=289.28s)]
*  time as press secretary to President Zelensky, you talked too about information wars at times. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=294.32s)]
*  And I think there's one going on right now. In fact, in the past week, we've seen much more of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=300.88s)]
*  an information battlefield coming from the Ukrainians trying to influence Russian opinion. Can you tell [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  me about that? Well, thank you a lot for this. I think that the defeat of the Russian army is [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=312.4s)]
*  the biggest influence for the Russian people because of course, Russian television propaganda [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  will lie a lot. They TV set and their biggest propagandists, they are super rich tycoons. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  But at the same time, you cannot hide the truth if mothers and wives and daughters get letters [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  from their beloved ones who disappear or who are brought dead to Russia. And right now, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=341.92s)]
*  over 53,000 of Russian servicemen were eliminated. This is the term by the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. So in fact, it's very hard not to notice when over 53,000 of people [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=355.04s)]
*  disappear, die, get back wounded with very severe wounds. And this is the only thing that happens [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=366.48s)]
*  with Russia is that they understand only strength and power. And this is the way to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=376.88s)]
*  convince the Russian people that this war must be finished and convince the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=382.88s)]
*  Russian leadership that they need to get out of our country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=387.68s)]
*  You were born in the late 1980s, right before the collapse of the Soviet Union. So you don't even [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=392.0s)]
*  remember Soviet occupation of Ukraine. How does that make you different from your parents and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=398.56s)]
*  grandparents generation? That's a good question. In fact, the Soviet Union did not collapse just [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=403.68s)]
*  with the signed documents. The atmosphere of Soviet Union stayed in the regions for some time. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=411.12s)]
*  It was just the change of mindset, the change of the system, more fresh air from the West that was [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=418.56s)]
*  coming in in the borders that had been closed for enormous time that actually changed the Soviet [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Union into a real democratic Ukraine. But I remember the 90s, they were very dark. They were very [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=433.36s)]
*  difficult for us. And my childhood was full of fear for the future, was full of limitations. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think that I would ever have had this type of life and career if Ukraine, for some big [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  unfortunate, could stay the part of the Soviet Union or could for some reason stay with Russia. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=461.12s)]
*  I think my fate would be just to become either propagandist or the oppositioner to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=468.08s)]
*  the authority that would pursue me and with whom I would need to fight. But in fact, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=474.88s)]
*  I became the press secretary to the president of Ukraine in an open way, winning the context of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=481.76s)]
*  around 4,000 of applicants. And this is what democracy means. And I'm very proud that Ukraine [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=487.76s)]
*  is the biggest territory of freedom and the biggest territory of democracy in post-Soviet region. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=494.56s)]
*  You just talked about becoming the press secretary to President Zelensky. And reading it in the book, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=500.48s)]
*  it's sort of an amazing thing. It was an open contest. How in the world you were in your [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=506.24s)]
*  early 30s then, a woman you didn't know President Zelensky. It was a somewhat corrupt society back [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=511.68s)]
*  then. What was this? How did this happen that you became press secretary? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=517.68s)]
*  Well, imagine President Zelensky comes to power and everybody had been watching him on TV screens [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=522.8s)]
*  in comedy for like 20 years. He became as popular as a rock star and it seemed that everyone wanted [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=528.96s)]
*  to work for him. And he becomes the first president to open this transparent competition. So we have [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=536.0s)]
*  like around 4,000 applications. I learned this number later. But I decided just to give it a [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=542.64s)]
*  chance. As soon as I sent my CV, I learned there are already 3,000. I'm like, okay, let's forget [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=549.92s)]
*  about this. But they hired NIHR companies and I passed through to the level where I had interviewed [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  with Volodymyr Zelensky himself. So what they did, they tried to pretend that he and his team are [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=562.8s)]
*  media sharks testing me as a press secretary. And there was one question that I think made Zelensky [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  make a decision to hire me. He asked about my motivation. So I said, if he as a man of a poor [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=576.96s)]
*  background from some province from Ukraine can become a president of the country in a democratic [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=585.36s)]
*  way and me as a girl from also the same poor background but from different region of Ukraine [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=590.88s)]
*  can openly become his press secretary, what is it if not a Ukrainian dream where everyone can achieve [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=597.76s)]
*  whatever they want. I think this was the answer that showed him that we shared the same vision [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=605.92s)]
*  of the country. And that's how I was hired. You were press secretary during the very infamous [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=611.8399999999999s)]
*  phone calls and conversations with Donald Trump and President Zelensky in which Donald Trump was [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=619.68s)]
*  pushing Ukraine to do an investigation of Hunter Biden and was threatening to hold up aid to Ukraine [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=626.4s)]
*  unless it was done and hold up a visit to the White House unless it was done. Tell me about [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=634.56s)]
*  hearing about that and hearing that the aid may have been frozen. What did you think? What did you [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=640.8s)]
*  do? So let me be clear here. I was not present at the call itself, but I was taking all the media [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=646.16s)]
*  inquiries and I was present at the negotiations with Donald Trump. And of course, I saw all the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=655.3599999999999s)]
*  reactions of President Zelensky and the team, which I somehow touched in my book. Everyone in [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=662.96s)]
*  the world now observes the achievements of the Ukrainian army. We have great people who stand [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=670.32s)]
*  for democracy and freedom, but at the same time, we wouldn't be able to do this if we don't have [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=677.52s)]
*  the financing, the support from our partners, if we don't have weaponry training. The Ukrainian army [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=682.72s)]
*  was in a super poor condition back in 2013 because of very corrupt pro-Russian President Yanukovych. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=689.44s)]
*  So it could weaken our army and who knows what the results could be. Maybe Putin could attack [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=696.08s)]
*  us earlier. Maybe Ukrainian army would not be able to stand against this. Maybe Ukraine wouldn't be [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  able to be independent now. The decision to hold on the so crucial military aid for Ukraine, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  could benefit only one person in the world and that was Vladimir Putin. That's why it was [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=720.4000000000001s)]
*  threatening in many ways. And I'm sure that Ukraine actually passed that period very bravely [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=727.44s)]
*  and very well in diplomatic ways so that we did not lose the support of Republicans and Democrats, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=735.6s)]
*  which was very, very crucial for Ukrainian army and for Ukrainian people. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=743.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, you just said that withholding that aid, which Donald Trump did for a while and threatening [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=748.4s)]
*  to hold it as he did, could only help one person, which is Vladimir Putin. Was that the feeling of [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=754.96s)]
*  those of you in the Zelensky administration that this was a mortal threat of what Donald Trump [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=761.68s)]
*  was trying to do in order to get this investigation of the Biden family? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  At that moment, there were so many things on one plate. Let me say that at that moment, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=772.88s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky, as an avicen in politics, achieved first results in negotiations with [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=781.28s)]
*  Putin. But he knew that Ukrainian army needed to stay, to stand there because Putin is very [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=786.16s)]
*  unpredictable and he is very aggressive. So in fact, we were very lucky that this aid was provided [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=793.92s)]
*  back and we hold this for a hundred million of dollars. When we today look at this army, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=801.28s)]
*  at Ukrainian army that makes so much success, we understand that this is the support of our [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=806.8s)]
*  partners in terms of training our soldiers, of providing a military support, equipment, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  helping them to behave correctly on the battlefield, to understand the thinking of the enemy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=820.0s)]
*  So all of this support was going there. And because of all these years of this support, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=828.8s)]
*  Ukrainian army can do all these successes today. So I cannot say that people were [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=834.88s)]
*  straightly talking about this with my words, but definitely this was in the air. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=841.68s)]
*  Now, President Biden just this past week has announced, I think, $2.8 billion more. What do [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=849.76s)]
*  you think of the Biden administration's response, Europe's response? Should they be doing more or [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=856.56s)]
*  is this something that's very heartening to you? This is a very important question for the reason [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=862.56s)]
*  that United States and Ukraine will share the same values. And I'm sure that American people [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=867.76s)]
*  understand what freedom is better than anyone in the world. This is the value for your people, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=874.0s)]
*  as much as for Ukrainians. And we are very grateful for the support, not only of the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=879.3599999999999s)]
*  government and the president who stands strong for Ukraine, but also for all the Americans who [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=884.24s)]
*  are doing so many amazing things and for American media who stand there to fight on information [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=889.28s)]
*  space. At the same time, what we need to understand is that we cannot stop. Though I know there is [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=895.04s)]
*  fatigue. I know that the winter is coming and Russia blackmails the world with energy crisis. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=901.6s)]
*  Russia weaponizes everything, all the resources that it has to fight the world. Russia tried to [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=909.12s)]
*  stop the grain exports and so many people can get hungry and can die from hunger. But we cannot stop [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=916.4s)]
*  of continuing this fight to get rid of Russia from Ukraine for the reason if we show some kind of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=925.52s)]
*  weakness or if we stop, Russia will return back and show all its aggression so that we don't lose [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=933.84s)]
*  the results that we achieve. Now we need to continue. We are heavily relying on the United [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=940.64s)]
*  States about weaponry supplies and about collaboration and military and intelligence [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=946.48s)]
*  sphere as much as it's continuing right now. Do you think that if the Ukrainian military is able [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=951.76s)]
*  to push the Russians back all the way to the line before February, before the most recent invasion, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=960.64s)]
*  do you think there could be a ceasefire in place for a while or do you think that would be too much [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=968.08s)]
*  a sign of weakness? Well, I was talking to different people and the plans, believe me, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=972.8s)]
*  change all the time because the Ukrainian authorities, officials and military are flexible [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=978.16s)]
*  because they want to be as effective as possible. At the same time, I understand that Ukrainian [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=983.92s)]
*  authorities are pretty realistic with the necessity of ceasefire, but it must be done in an appropriate [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=991.12s)]
*  moment. We cannot just give up like 15-20 percent of our land, forgive and forget all the people who [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=997.68s)]
*  died there because thousands and thousands of Ukrainians died with absolutely horrible deaths, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1005.76s)]
*  in horrible conditions. So we need to think with all the global community how to hold Russia [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1011.12s)]
*  accountable because accountability is the only way to move forward. And in this way we should move [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1018.4s)]
*  towards the peace deal, but on the conditions of civilized countries, on the conditions of Ukraine, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1027.44s)]
*  we cannot allow Russia to do whatever it wants and just forget it, you know, to move forward. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1034.0s)]
*  So I believe that Ukraine will do everything right now to return the territories that were lost after [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1040.08s)]
*  February 24, but I also believe that the next step for Ukraine, the homework that Ukraine will need [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1047.52s)]
*  to do, will be to align the standards with NATO as much as possible, to train as much as possible, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1052.7199999999998s)]
*  to stay as strong as possible so that Russia do not come back in two, three or five years. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  Julia Mendel, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dxnYoILoB8&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
