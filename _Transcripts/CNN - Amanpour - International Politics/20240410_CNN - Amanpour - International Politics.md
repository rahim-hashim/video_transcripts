# Is There Selective Outrage With Who Dies in the IsraelGaza Conflict?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg)
*  Next, we return to our top story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF continues to carry out its war in Gaza, and the health ministry there says more [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=2.84s)]
*  than 30,000 people have been killed since October 7. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=7.8s)]
*  While the Israeli military is facing growing international warnings against its planned [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=11.68s)]
*  assault on Ra'far, author and global affairs journalist Emily Tamkin has been writing about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=15.88s)]
*  this war for online magazine Slate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=22.16s)]
*  And her most recent article explores the reaction to the death of the world's central kitchen [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=24.64s)]
*  aid workers, and she joins Michelle Martin to discuss why she believes this story has [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=29.72s)]
*  provoked more worldwide condemnation than before. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=34.84s)]
*  Thanks Christiane. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=40.16s)]
*  Emily Tamkin, thank you so much for talking with us once again. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=41.16s)]
*  Of course, thank you for having me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=43.84s)]
*  If you were to piece for Slate, it's titled, Why the World Central Kitchen Aid Workers' [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=44.84s)]
*  Deaths Broke Through the Horror of This War. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=49.44s)]
*  The first thing I want to ask you is, what convinces you that it did break through? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=53.24s)]
*  Right, it's a great question. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=57.0s)]
*  I think what I was trying to get at in the piece is that the reaction to these deaths [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=58.44s)]
*  was so, the reaction was so dramatic and so full of outrage in a way that we haven't really [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=62.64s)]
*  seen so far in the six months since October 7. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=71.24s)]
*  And there have been, you know, Israel has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=74.72s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=79.8s)]
*  And it's not that people haven't expressed shock and horror and outrage to all of that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=80.8s)]
*  seven deaths of WCK, really, you know, you had President Biden making a statement of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=85.4s)]
*  outrage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  You have Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that U.S. policy will change if Israel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  doesn't change course. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  You have outrage from Britain and from Australia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  And I was sort of, I was interested in the perfect storm of conditions that got this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=100.56s)]
*  reaction from leaders. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  And to your point, I also wanted to make clear that statements of outrage, and even about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=106.84s)]
*  apology from Israel and from the IDF, which is quite rare, that that doesn't necessarily [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=114.36s)]
*  mean that it has broken through the horror, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=119.56s)]
*  That that doesn't actually mean that we are going to see policy change. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=121.56s)]
*  Well, so just back up for a second. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=124.52s)]
*  And when you heard what happened, do you remember how you reacted? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=126.48s)]
*  I wasn't am shocked by this, but it's not, it's also not surprising. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=130.12s)]
*  And what I mean by that, and I don't in any way want to downplay the horror of seven aid [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=134.8s)]
*  workers being killed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=139.48s)]
*  You know, it's horrific. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=141.84s)]
*  These are people who are trying to distribute food to those in desperate need. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  But on the other hand, there have already been, there had already been roughly 190 other [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  aid workers killed over the course of this war, again, in addition to tens of thousands [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=152.88s)]
*  of Palestinians. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=157.44s)]
*  And so the conditions in which this war is being carried out, the way in which this war [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  is being carried out did not suggest to me that, you know, that Jose Andres's team would [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  be able to indefinitely, safely provide food to those in need. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  And just for people who aren't aware, Jose Andres is the founder of World Central Kitchen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  He's, you know, I'm in the Washington, D.C. area. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=176.32s)]
*  Very well known. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=179.32s)]
*  First, he was very well known as a restaurateur, but then he's obviously become, you know, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=180.32s)]
*  a much bigger figure than that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about what struck you first, and then let's talk about why you think it has [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  caused the reaction that it has caused. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  A few hours before I got news of the attack, my dad and I were having a conversation, and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=192.28s)]
*  he brought up Jose Andres and the aid workers and said, this is so amazing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=196.28s)]
*  They're able to get this aid in. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  They're able to provide this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  You know, he's such a hero. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=202.84s)]
*  And so my first, to be honest, my first reaction was we were we were just talking about this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  And the reason I mentioned this is that I think that that's the kind of salience that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=210.28s)]
*  Jose Andres and World Central Kitchen have, which is part of why you got an apology from [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=213.84s)]
*  the IDF, which is part of why you got outraged from the Biden White House, because he's just [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=218.44s)]
*  familiar to people in a way that other nonprofits were not and are not. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=222.72s)]
*  So you identify a couple of factors that you think are at play here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  When is race? Talk about that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=230.1s)]
*  Absolutely. I think, look, and I again, I don't I don't want to say that every person [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=232.1s)]
*  who was was shocked and outraged by this and wasn't before is is an outright racist. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=236.66s)]
*  But I do think that there is at minimum an internalized prejudice about who we expect [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=241.38s)]
*  to die. Right. And when you expect people to die, you're also accepting their deaths. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=245.7s)]
*  And I do think there's a level of people accepting Palestinian death in a way that they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=250.22s)]
*  don't, you know, British or Australian or Canadian or American. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=254.44s)]
*  So there were seven workers who were killed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=259.18s)]
*  One of them was Palestinian. The other six were were not. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=260.94s)]
*  And Amira Hassan Haaretz wrote basically saying that the massive headache that Israel is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=264.54s)]
*  facing now, they would not have had to face had all seven been Palestinian. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=268.14s)]
*  And I think that's that's fair. And I think the way we know that that's fair is that we [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=272.38s)]
*  haven't seen this kind of outrage until now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=276.18s)]
*  The other two are we already sort of touched on Jose Andres's celebrity. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=279.42s)]
*  I really think it's important to stress that it's not just that he is globally famous, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=282.7s)]
*  although he is. Right. You mentioned that you're in the D.C. area. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=286.58s)]
*  I am as well. He's so well known here in particular. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think when the restaurant that you go to after work for drinks is owned by the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=292.38s)]
*  person who is getting on, who's doing a Reuters interview and saying they systematically [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=296.82s)]
*  are killing aid workers like that, that cuts through in a way that other deaths perhaps [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=301.5s)]
*  don't. And I think the final the final reason that I identified and this is the hardest [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=306.34s)]
*  to articulate and also to wrap my own mind around is that these people were killed for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=310.18s)]
*  doing something that is as inoffensive as giving food to those who are starving. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=314.22s)]
*  You know, Crisis Group, the International Crisis Group came out with a report just days [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=318.74s)]
*  ago saying that the north of Gaza is on the brink of famine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=322.3s)]
*  Should Israel push further into the south? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  It will be the case there as well. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  Starvation, if it does not kill you, the effects of it for children are felt throughout [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=331.54s)]
*  the course of their lives. It affects their development. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  It affects every mentally, physically and to say nothing of it being collective [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=337.38000000000005s)]
*  punishment, to say nothing of how the sort of the inherent human right that people have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  to nourishment. Like that's what was being provided by these aid workers. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=348.5s)]
*  And that's why they were killed, because they were trying to provide that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=351.5s)]
*  I think that in your fact sort of got through to people with this with with these strikes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  Do you think it's it's in part it's just human nature to be more concerned about people [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=360.38s)]
*  that you think you know or that you actually know than about people you don't? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=366.34s)]
*  Or absolutely. I mean, look, I think it's I think it's it's it's human nature and it's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=371.61999999999995s)]
*  understandable. And it's also something where it is my hope that we can take that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=376.97999999999996s)]
*  Sort of take that moment of connection and recognition. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=383.94s)]
*  And it's hard to do this. I understand it's hard to do this, but to take that moment of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=386.82s)]
*  connection, recognition and extend it to these other people who we haven't encountered. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=389.5s)]
*  And I think that that's. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=393.17999999999995s)]
*  That's hard to wrap your mind around. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=396.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=397.42s)]
*  At least is that every one of those crisis group had it at thirty thousand people, every [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=397.94s)]
*  one of those thirty three thousand people who have who have been killed so far in Gaza [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=402.82s)]
*  and all of those other one hundred ninety something aid workers have people who knew [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=406.5s)]
*  them, too. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=410.66s)]
*  One of the reasons that you said you also think this could be an inflection point is [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  that it speaks to incompetence because in the initial wake of the October 7th Hamas [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  attack on southern Israel, the question was, well, how could this happen? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=420.42s)]
*  I mean, this is supposed to be the best equipped, you know, army intelligence service, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  you know, in the region, because you have to know that politically and in every other [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=430.22s)]
*  instance, this would be, as you put it, a headache for the IDF. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=435.3s)]
*  And so so what role do you think that plays in sort of shifting people's thinking about, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=438.22s)]
*  well, wait a minute, they don't know what they're doing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think this is a question both for Israel's allies and it's and their counterparts [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=445.26s)]
*  in other countries and also for Israeli people themselves, right, who who perhaps after [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=451.42s)]
*  October 7th supported, you know, supported the war and wanted to get back at Hamas and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=456.5s)]
*  wanted to solve it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=462.66s)]
*  Something had to change. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=464.42s)]
*  I guess the question is, if if one so the idea that this conducted its own internal [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=466.22s)]
*  investigation and said this was a series of mistakes, this should never have happened. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  OK, if that's true. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=474.06s)]
*  Why why were you why did you strike multiple times cars with WCK, you know, symbols on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=476.66s)]
*  their roofs on a de-conflicted route and why why have one hundred ninety something [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=485.98s)]
*  other aid workers also been killed over the last six months? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=490.82s)]
*  And I think, you know, just as Jose Andres and WCK have resonance for people outside [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=494.14s)]
*  I think it's important to note that, you know, unlike Anra, where Israel has long suspected [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=501.14s)]
*  Hamas infiltration or cooperation, WCK doesn't have that reputation in Israel. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=507.58s)]
*  And in fact, as we said, you know, worked to feed Israelis after October 7th. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=512.1s)]
*  And I think I think that perhaps there's a world in which this because it's so high [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=516.62s)]
*  profile, because it's such an international Ruaha, because it's, you know, because it's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=522.02s)]
*  so clearly understood to be a tragedy that this asks, well, what is the function of this [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=528.3s)]
*  war besides inflicting? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=532.54s)]
*  Can can this war as it's being carried out do anything but kill many people? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=534.58s)]
*  And if so, is that a war that we want to stand behind? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=539.3s)]
*  All right, let me just be clear about what the IDF said. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  The IDF chief of staff issued a rare apology saying, I want to be very clear. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=545.18s)]
*  The strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=550.14s)]
*  It was a mistake that followed a misidentification at night during a war in very complex [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=554.98s)]
*  conditions. It shouldn't have happened, unquote. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=560.58s)]
*  Your thoughts about that? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=564.34s)]
*  I would say two things. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=566.66s)]
*  The first is that I don't think any military can conduct its own investigation into itself. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=569.34s)]
*  I think that's not something they're capable of doing, particularly during an ongoing [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=574.78s)]
*  war. And so while I think the rare apology speaks to how salient this event is and how [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=578.14s)]
*  you know, the the the outrage that's ensued. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=585.14s)]
*  And while I am, you know, just on a human level, glad that it's been taken seriously, I [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=590.66s)]
*  think that really shouldn't for the international community. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=595.26s)]
*  That can't be acceptable. And the other thing that I again, I would stress is that these [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=598.54s)]
*  seven deaths were a tragedy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=602.66s)]
*  These seven aid workers deaths. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=603.86s)]
*  These were not the only aid workers who have been killed over the course of this war. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think a reasonable question is if this should not have happened, what about the other [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=608.3000000000001s)]
*  roughly 190 people who are trying to provide aid who have been killed in the course of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=612.42s)]
*  this war? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=615.9399999999999s)]
*  Do you ever wonder about the moral injury to the soldiers and reservists who have been [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=616.46s)]
*  responsible for these kinds of acts? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=623.9399999999999s)]
*  And I wonder whether there's some thought to the moral injury that they are experiencing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=626.34s)]
*  when they find out that they have killed innocent people who are just trying to offer food [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=631.7s)]
*  to people. I just I just wonder if anybody talks about that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=635.66s)]
*  Well, there are I mean, there is an organization in Israel called Breaking the Silence, which [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=639.3000000000001s)]
*  is where people who have served in the military come back and sort of say, you know, it's [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=643.22s)]
*  sort of it's sort of a mea culpa. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=648.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I know I think we will have some of that in the wake of this war. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  I think others will blame Hamas for putting them in this position in the first place. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=656.82s)]
*  I don't I don't think that we that we know yet how the military specifically and how [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=660.4200000000001s)]
*  you know, I don't think how the military specifically will process this. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=664.82s)]
*  I do. We do know, however, from studies that younger Palestinians and younger Israelis [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=671.1s)]
*  do tend to be more more hardened in their views, particularly Palestinians in Gaza and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=676.9000000000001s)]
*  the West Bank and Israelis and Israel proper tend to be more hardened in their views and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=681.7800000000001s)]
*  more extreme and see peace as less of a possibility. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=686.1s)]
*  And I don't you know, I don't mean to be cynical, but I really don't see how this war [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=688.82s)]
*  does anything but exacerbate that trend. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=692.34s)]
*  Hmm. In the short term, at least as recognizing that you're a journalist and an analyst, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=694.58s)]
*  you're not a sort of a policymaker, you know, you know, an elected person. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=698.98s)]
*  Are there other things as a as a person who's been following this closely? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=702.5s)]
*  What else should happen in your opinion? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=708.98s)]
*  What else would you like to see happen? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=710.9000000000001s)]
*  What do you think will happen as a consequence of this? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=712.1800000000001s)]
*  The reality is that as a human being, I think. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=715.22s)]
*  That to say like, oh, people starve in war is just unacceptable. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=718.1s)]
*  And the crisis group report that I mentioned says that if there is not an indefinite ceasefire, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=722.74s)]
*  there will be mass starvation and that even short of that ceasefire, there needs to be [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=727.94s)]
*  dramatic change and much more aid needs to be allowed into Gaza by Israel. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=732.5s)]
*  There have been some changes like in the in the wake of this in the wake of this strike. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=736.66s)]
*  And I think if those are just sort of to make people feel like they're in a state of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=740.9s)]
*  I think if those are just sort of to make people stop looking and then it goes back to as it was, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=745.2199999999999s)]
*  that's totally unacceptable. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=750.3399999999999s)]
*  I also do wonder if, you know, you have Biden saying these outreach, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=751.78s)]
*  you have Lincoln saying something must change, you have Senate, you have Democrats on the Hill, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=757.14s)]
*  including Nancy Pelosi saying that that they would like to see weapons transfers to Israel suspended. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=761.54s)]
*  I guess, again, we were speaking before about about the Israeli people asking themselves, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=768.8199999999999s)]
*  what is the function of this? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=774.66s)]
*  You know, the Biden administration has for months now said that they want to see [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  transfer of power in Gaza. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=780.5s)]
*  They want to see fewer civilian deaths. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=782.18s)]
*  They want to see more aid let in. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=785.6999999999999s)]
*  They eventually want to see the establishment of a Palestinian state. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=787.38s)]
*  And I guess my question for them is if your current policy is not getting you any of those things, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=790.18s)]
*  then what is the function of the policy? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=798.66s)]
*  And I think as journalists, it is our job to ask that question. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=801.86s)]
*  If you say, OK, if you don't let more humanitarian aid in, we're going to be really upset. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=805.3s)]
*  OK, and what? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=810.98s)]
*  And what are you going to do with all of that upset, all of that outrage? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  So that is that's what I will be watching for in the days and weeks to come. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=816.8199999999999s)]
*  Before you go, do you mind if I ask, how are you? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=820.42s)]
*  It seems to be a hard moment to decide what is fair and to sort of honor the suffering that one [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=823.54s)]
*  sees without negating the suffering of others. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  And I'm just interested if you don't mind my asking, how is this for you? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=832.58s)]
*  I think there's a sense here in the United States that you're on [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=836.82s)]
*  sort of one or other side of suffering. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=839.94s)]
*  And when you think about the Israeli hostages who are being held in Gaza, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=843.38s)]
*  who should not be being held in Gaza, who should not be there, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=848.4200000000001s)]
*  I want to be very clear about this. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=851.62s)]
*  They also do not have access to food. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=853.62s)]
*  They are also under aerial bombardment. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=857.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think the idea that we're that there's like a winner in suffering [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=859.14s)]
*  is I think it's a bit of a false dichotomy that we've [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=866.58s)]
*  that some in the American political discourses have presented. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=869.6999999999999s)]
*  And the other thing, you know, I yeah, it's been look, I think for all of us reporting on [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=873.86s)]
*  this writing about it, it's been an intense last six months. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=878.34s)]
*  I write as as a Jewish journalist, and I often write in a way that's critical of [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  choices that the Israeli government has made or individual Jewish groups, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=890.1s)]
*  which I think whenever you are assuming an identity and writing about writing from that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=893.14s)]
*  perspective, there will be those who also claim that identity, who get quite upset and perhaps [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=897.46s)]
*  email or, you know, sort of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=903.06s)]
*  write whatever on social media. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=906.42s)]
*  And that's not always the most pleasant. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=907.46s)]
*  But I do think that what I've returned to is I'm fine. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=909.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm here in my home in D.C. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=914.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=917.3s)]
*  Like I'm safe. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=917.54s)]
*  I have food and there are I just think the toll that this has taken on [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=918.26s)]
*  journalists in, you know, journalists in Israel who are trying to hold their own [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=923.3s)]
*  government to account and do the job of journalism and journalists in Gaza who've [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=927.14s)]
*  been trying to do their jobs under truly unimaginable circumstances is is humbling, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=930.58s)]
*  to say the very least. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=936.8199999999999s)]
*  And whenever I sort of, you know, find myself start to to wallow, that's what I return to. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=937.7s)]
*  Emily, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=945.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=947.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNAnfUrtHg&t=948.26s)]
