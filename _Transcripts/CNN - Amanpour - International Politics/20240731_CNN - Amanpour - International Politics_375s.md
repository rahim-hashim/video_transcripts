# Expert Reacts to the Killing of Hamas’ Political Leader, Ismail Haniyeh  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0)
*  Ronan Bergeron, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=0.0s)]
*  As always, you are the perfect guest specifically on this topic of targeted assassinations, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=2.44s)]
*  because that appears to be exactly what we have seen with precision. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=7.32s)]
*  Israel taking credit for the strike against the senior Hezbollah official there, Fouad [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=11.72s)]
*  Shulker, in Beirut, yet to take credit for what is assumed to be an Israeli strike against [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=16.28s)]
*  the Hamas official there in Tehran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And I'm curious from your perspective what you make of the timing and the fact that Israel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=26.4s)]
*  is doing this now following what we saw was a huge escalation from Hezbollah on Saturday [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=33.44s)]
*  where the Israeli defense minister himself said Hezbollah had crossed a red line following [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=39.72s)]
*  the death of those 12 children, the Druze children there in the northern part of the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  So thanks for that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=52.72s)]
*  I think we need to maybe make some kind of differentiation between these two attacks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=55.12s)]
*  There's one attack that Israel claimed responsibility for and said this was following the killing [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=61.44s)]
*  of 12 teenagers and children in the Golan Heights a few days earlier. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  This was part of an ongoing exchange of blows and attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  starting on the 8th of October. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=83.44s)]
*  So one day after Hamas attacked in the south, Hezbollah started to attack Israel in the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=86.0s)]
*  north, and ever since they're just exchanging horrible, horrible fight and battles and hits [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=90.8s)]
*  and attacks against each other. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=100.44s)]
*  However, they keep that under some kind of a level, some kind of a bar, where they try [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=102.4s)]
*  to assess where is the bar for the other side that would deter the other side from continuing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=110.24s)]
*  to accelerate but will not deteriorate the whole region into war. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=117.92s)]
*  We have seen 10 months of these two military forces, the IDF and Hezbollah, doing horrible [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=124.8s)]
*  things to each other and to civilians and I think civilians in urban areas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think what we learned from that is that these two sides are trying to do [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  to harm the other side while not deteriorating into a war. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=146.32s)]
*  Hezbollah has identified what happened on Iran, what happened on this attack yesterday. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=152.0s)]
*  It's something that they would retaliate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=161.12s)]
*  And of course it sort of left an open question of what would be the retaliation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=164.16s)]
*  And if that would bring Israeli retaliation for the retaliation, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=171.12s)]
*  that could escalate when both sides lose control. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Now let's take a listen to what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=181.2s)]
*  In Matsdal Shams, I saw the sorrow of the families. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=187.04s)]
*  I said to our Druze brothers and sisters, we are brothers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  We have covenant. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=197.68s)]
*  And this is a tight covenant from grief to grief. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=200.8s)]
*  The innocent people, in addition to the suffer of the North citizens that are [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=206.88s)]
*  not able to live in their houses, we are not going to be silent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=216.96s)]
*  Make everyone pay the price, everyone that's murder us, anyone that take our children, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=224.96s)]
*  citizens of Israel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  These are challenging days. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=234.56s)]
*  From Beirut there are threats. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=238.4s)]
*  We are ready for any scenario. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  We are prepared. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=245.36s)]
*  We are going to take high price, going to get high price from each arena. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=248.0s)]
*  There you heard sort of a victory lap, a typical victory lap from the Prime Minister sort of taking [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=253.52s)]
*  credit for yesterday and what we saw in that assassination attempt of the senior Hezbollah [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=259.44s)]
*  official, Fuad Shucher, and also avoiding any mention of the killing there of Ismael Kaniya [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=264.24s)]
*  in Iran, but going on to once again highlight what he continues to say is Israel's ongoing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=273.68s)]
*  victory and the path towards victory in Gaza. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=280.48s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of what we heard from him yesterday, at times just giving the public [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=283.6s)]
*  an update as to where things stand also appears to be part of a political speech wrapped into one. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think what we heard is the Benjamin Netanyahu, hawkish stance to continue the war [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=296.48s)]
*  until what he calls the utmost or the perfect or the full victory [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  without defining what that victory means or addressing the questions of what is the day [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=318.8s)]
*  after. What is the Israeli policy towards Gaza? Is Israel want to stay in Gaza? Is it the military [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=324.4s)]
*  control or is Israel trying to build the force that will control Gaza the day after? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=332.0s)]
*  In any case, I think this is a this speech reinforce some echoes that we heard from [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu upon his return from the U.S. where it seems that he has taken a few steps [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=344.64s)]
*  back on his willingness to sign the ceasefire hostage exchange deal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25KYcbDZlz0&t=351.36s)]
