# The “Uncommitted” Movement: Where Does Kamala Harris Stand on Israel-Gaza? | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw)
*  Now, the Israel-Gaza war is of course a U.S. campaign issue. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris met with Prime Minister Netanyahu just last week in Washington. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=5.32s)]
*  But for many voters, how the VP would manage the conflict if elected is not yet clear. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=10.6s)]
*  Hari Sreenivasan speaks to Walid Shaheed, Democratic strategist and co-founder of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=16.2s)]
*  uncommitted national movement, to discuss Harris' recent actions and how she could try [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=20.8s)]
*  to win over undecided voters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=26.12s)]
*  Bionda, thanks. Walid Shaheed, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=29.32s)]
*  Just recently, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress, Vice President [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=32.8s)]
*  Harris met with him and she said that she had expressed and pressed him on the humanitarian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=38.8s)]
*  crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  She publicly emphasized the need for a ceasefire and the protection of Palestinian civilians. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=46.72s)]
*  Do you think that this is going to translate in a tangible policy difference as she runs [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=52.36s)]
*  for president? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=60.16s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=61.2s)]
*  I think that many of the uncommitted voters, many people who've been opposed to Netanyahu's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=62.2s)]
*  war in Gaza, were welcomed the step in the right direction from Vice President Harris [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=66.88s)]
*  in terms of using rhetoric that empathized with Palestinian families in Gaza that showed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=73.44s)]
*  some humanity. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=78.72s)]
*  On the policy substance level, we're not sure what her governing vision is for foreign policy [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=80.04s)]
*  and for the war in Gaza and we're still waiting to hear what that might be. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=85.2s)]
*  We're excited that she might turn the page on Biden's, what's been Biden's disastrous [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=89.76s)]
*  policy on Gaza as it's fractured the Democratic Party and the coalition. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  We're looking forward to Vice President Harris coming out against more American weapons for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=101.4s)]
*  Netanyahu's war, for the Israeli government's war, but right now we don't know what her [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=106.88s)]
*  foreign policy vision is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=110.56s)]
*  You're one of the co-founders of the uncommitted movement and that's 700,000 Americans who [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=112.56s)]
*  voted uncommitted during the primaries. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  For people who might not be that familiar with it, tell us a little bit about the origins, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=120.46s)]
*  how it came about, what the goals are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  It came about because during the fall after the war in Gaza started, many voters in Arab [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  and Muslim communities across the country, many young progressive Democratic Party voters [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=134.16000000000003s)]
*  felt extremely angry that the primaries were starting and there wasn't an option for them [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=139.28s)]
*  on the ballot to suggest that they were against Biden's policies as it pertained to funding [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  Israel's war and occupation against Palestinians. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=151.28s)]
*  My own father, a lifelong Democrat, has voted Democrat his whole life, told me over Thanksgiving [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=154.96s)]
*  holidays that he couldn't bring himself to vote for Biden because Biden had just crossed a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=160.32s)]
*  line for him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=165.12s)]
*  Those voters were being invisibilized in our democratic process and the uncommitted movement [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=166.32s)]
*  started in Michigan in order to give all of those Democratic voters a vehicle to express [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=170.32s)]
*  their deep dissatisfaction with Joe Biden's policy on Gaza while remaining in the Democratic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=175.28s)]
*  Party camp. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=180.4s)]
*  We wanted to show that these voters were serious, that the party was leaving them, the party [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=181.28s)]
*  was betraying their values and the party wasn't standing up for its own values of peace and human [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=185.76s)]
*  rights and justice. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=190.72s)]
*  And now we have 30 delegates who will be at the Democratic National Convention at the end of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  August in Chicago who will be bringing those communities and those demands for an end to the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=196.48s)]
*  war, for a ceasefire, and for an end to U.S. weapons to Israel, all to the Democratic Party [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=200.56s)]
*  and hoping to be embraced. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=208.0s)]
*  What are the steps that Vice President Harris would have to take in order to gain those 30 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=209.6s)]
*  delegates and really just more than 30 delegates the support of the uncommitted movement? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=216.24s)]
*  So the uncommitted national movement, those 30 delegates, are requesting a meeting with Vice [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=221.6s)]
*  President Harris and her campaign to talk about the pain and anger of the communities that we all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=226.08s)]
*  represent, that people have felt in terms of Biden's foreign policy decisions with respect to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=232.24s)]
*  Palestinian human rights. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=238.24s)]
*  We want to see Vice President Harris come out against U.S. weapons for Netanyahu's war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=240.08s)]
*  We want to see an end to this war, an exchange of hostages and captives, Israelis and Palestinians, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=245.28s)]
*  and a just solution for all Israelis and Palestinians that we can move toward. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Let me reference a couple of the things that she said. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=258.32s)]
*  She said after the meeting with Netanyahu, what's happened in Gaza over the past nine months is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=260.88s)]
*  devastating the images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=266.08s)]
*  sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=270.24s)]
*  We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  So Vice President Harris says this, but how much of this do you think is kind of political [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  positioning in what she needs to do right now as the candidate for the Democratic Party? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=287.52s)]
*  And how much of it do you think is sincere? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=293.36s)]
*  Vice President Harris is from a different generation of Democrats than President Biden, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=295.84s)]
*  and I think she's responding to the genuine shift in the Democratic Party and in the American [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  electorate that a majority of Americans, a majority of Democrats are not supportive of Israel's war and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=304.64s)]
*  occupation of Palestinians and are definitely not supportive of American bombs or American taxpayer [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  money going to Netanyahu's far-right extreme government. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=316.96s)]
*  I think she recognizes that the party has changed and she's trying to balance [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  how to address that while still being the Vice President to President Biden. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=324.56s)]
*  You know, staying with the after effects of this speech or the aftermath of the speech, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=328.08s)]
*  I mean you sent out a tweet saying the most important thing you should know, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=332.56s)]
*  in 2015 about 50 Democrats in Congress boycotted Netanyahu's speech to Congress. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=335.36s)]
*  Today it was 136 Democrats. Netanyahu and AIPAC are losing the Democratic Party. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=339.76s)]
*  Explain. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=346.48s)]
*  So one major thing that the uncommitted delegation wants to do at the convention is to ensure that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=347.36s)]
*  President Biden is the last AIPAC-aligned Democratic nominee for President. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=352.4s)]
*  AIPAC is a lobbying group in the United States that tries to ensure there's no daylight between [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  the United States government and the Israeli government, no matter how extreme or far-right [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=362.0s)]
*  the Israeli governments under Netanyahu have become. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  The doubling of the amount of Democrats who did not attend Netanyahu's speech from 2015 [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=369.67999999999995s)]
*  to a week ago is a huge step forward in terms of the Democratic Party rejecting AIPAC's influence [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=375.44s)]
*  in a party that's dedicated to freedom and justice and human rights for all. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=382.0s)]
*  Senator Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries allowing Netanyahu to speak made a mockery of our party's claim [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=386.64s)]
*  to be against MAGA extremism, to be against far-right politics, because what Netanyahu has done [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=392.96s)]
*  to democracy for Israelis and Palestinians is like MAGA on steroids. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=398.8s)]
*  And so we think it's a major step forward and the reason Vice President Harris's rhetoric [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=404.08s)]
*  has shifted is because the party below her, the party beneath her, has also shifted. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=408.96s)]
*  That speech was a propagandistic, pro-violence, hateful, racist speech directing all sorts of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=413.28s)]
*  bigotry toward Palestinians and violence against Palestinians. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  And so I was ashamed as a Democrat myself that Democrats allowed Netanyahu to speak, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=424.4s)]
*  but I was very optimistic that so many in our party did not attend. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  Is it fair to equate the policies that the Prime Minister of Israel is carrying out [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  with the viewpoints of AIPAC, which has for a long time had the support of and given support [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=438.24s)]
*  to the Democratic Party? AIPAC has spent historic amounts of money this election cycle to keep [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=444.88s)]
*  progressive Democrats in line and by challenging people like Jamal Bowman and Cori Bush, spending [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=450.24s)]
*  ad money against people like Somerlea and Rashida Tlaib in order to discipline and punish progressive [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=457.44s)]
*  Democrats from questioning unrestricted weapons aid, a blank check to the Israeli government. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  That is the number one thing that they care about because it's symbolic for them. Once the United [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=470.08s)]
*  States starts putting restrictions or conditions on weapons that we provide the Israeli government, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=473.84s)]
*  just like we do for any other country, that becomes a slippery slope for them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  And in many ways, AIPAC can be compared to the NRA. The NRA was a part of the Democratic Party [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=483.76s)]
*  two decades ago. There were many Democrats who embraced the NRA, had endorsements from the NRA, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  but slowly over time, the NRA's brand and form of politics became toxic within the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=495.68s)]
*  Democratic Party electorate. So now there's maybe only one or two Democrats in all of Congress who [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=500.24s)]
*  have the endorsement of the NRA. I think AIPAC over time will slowly go the way of the NRA and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=504.88s)]
*  become a Republican Party organization. Most of their donors are Republicans. Most of their donors [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=510.88s)]
*  have backed Donald Trump. And I think that slowly what we're going to see is that the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=515.36s)]
*  foreign policy hawks who are wanting to send unrestricted weapons aid to Israel will slowly [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  drift into the Republican Party over time. Tell me, what about the VP pick? How does that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=526.88s)]
*  factor in to the uncommitted voters? I think a lot of uncommitted voters are watching the VP pick. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=533.12s)]
*  They want to make sure that the VP pick aligns with their views on foreign policy, on human rights. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=539.28s)]
*  There are many picks out there that could be beneficial and balance the ticket. I think some [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  voters are concerned about Governor Josh Shapiro, not only because of Gaza. He's a supporter of [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=552.0s)]
*  charter schools, which teachers unions tend to oppose. He is alleged to have mishandled a sexual [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=557.12s)]
*  harassment case. He went to battle with a progressive district attorney, Larry Krasner, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=562.48s)]
*  dividing the justice reform community and the civil rights community in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  On top of all of that, he has used very escalated rhetoric to compare student protesters [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=572.8s)]
*  to the Ku Klux Klan, extreme violent white supremacist groups. Whereas, Governor Brashear, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  Tim Walz, they're a little bit more of a blank slate, I think, and have taken less [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=585.12s)]
*  controversial positions in the last few years that divide the electorate deeply. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=589.92s)]
*  Arab Americans are only about 1% of the population, but they've been very influential in this specific [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=594.24s)]
*  group, the uncommitted. I wonder, especially when you look at a population like in Dearborn, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=600.64s)]
*  in Michigan, which is as important as any other community, maybe more so because it's a battleground [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=606.7199999999999s)]
*  state, what do you think the outcomes are here? Is this going to come down to this single issue [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=613.04s)]
*  for Michigan? In recent polling of both Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=620.4s)]
*  before Vice President Harris took over the ticket, a plurality of Arab and Muslim Americans were not [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=625.68s)]
*  going to vote for Joe Biden. That would have been the first time that Arab and Muslim Americans [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=630.88s)]
*  didn't vote for the Democratic presidential candidate since the year 2000. I think people, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=635.52s)]
*  because of Donald Trump, have this kind of misguided view of the Arab American and Muslim [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=641.12s)]
*  American vote that it's democratic. But I think there was a big inclusion of Muslim Americans and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=645.76s)]
*  Arab Americans because of Donald Trump's racist and Islamophobic rhetoric and advocacy for the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=653.04s)]
*  Muslim ban that solidified some of that vote. But I think the partisan loyalty to the Democratic [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=658.48s)]
*  Party is pretty thin. People want some sort of recognition of their humanity and their [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=663.92s)]
*  policy demands in exchange for their votes. I will also say that in terms of the uncommitted votes, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=669.04s)]
*  we've seen data from Minnesota and Michigan that most of the uncommitted votes came from [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=674.4s)]
*  precincts that were dominated by voters under 40, not necessarily just Arab and Muslim communities. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=679.36s)]
*  So I think this is a very diverse, big tent coalition that obviously includes [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=684.64s)]
*  Muslim and Arab Democrats, but also just young Democrats of all backgrounds. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=689.44s)]
*  I should remind the audience, Aloka, Arab is not necessarily synonymous with Muslim. The majority [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=693.6s)]
*  of Arab Americans are in fact Christian, and several of those vote Republican and have voted [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=698.0s)]
*  Republican. And it's also something that the Trump campaign is trying to reach out to this [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=703.84s)]
*  audience as well. I mean, his daughter, Tiffany, her father-in-law is an Arab American, and he's [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=709.76s)]
*  trying to get out on the stump. I mean, do you think that those inroads are working from the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=714.4s)]
*  Trump campaign, seeing that there is this opportunity and this possible weakness of if [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=718.64s)]
*  this constituency is not going to automatically ally with the Democrats, can we peel off a small [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=725.12s)]
*  percentage here or a small percentage there? The Republican Party and Donald Trump campaign [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=730.72s)]
*  are definitely trying to make inroads into the Arab and Muslim American community. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=734.96s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump thrives in an environment of cynicism. And so what Donald [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=739.36s)]
*  Trump's campaign is doing is trying to breed cynicism in our communities by showing that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=745.28s)]
*  Democrats and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't care about people like you. And it's a lot easier [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=749.84s)]
*  when you're not the incumbent to just make a case that you need to punish the other side, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=754.64s)]
*  that you need to get rid of the other side and trust someone new, trust someone a little bit more [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=759.28s)]
*  chaotic, a little bit more different that might be able to give you what you want. I've also seen a [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  lot of misinformation and disinformation peddled by Republican Party organizations and Trump [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  affiliated social media networks that use clips of Donald Trump in interviews where he signals [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=773.92s)]
*  that he's against Netanyahu's war, or he's no longer for a Muslim ban, these kinds of things, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=780.24s)]
*  which I think are deliberately trying to mislead people of Trump's views. Donald Trump, his former [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=787.04s)]
*  ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, they have said very clearly that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=793.04s)]
*  their policies on Palestine are to turn Gaza into real estate and expel Palestinians from Gaza, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=798.48s)]
*  to increase settlement expansions so that Israel can finally annex the West Bank. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  And JD Vance in particular has talked about cracking down on Palestinian-American, Muslim-American, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=811.92s)]
*  progressive civil society in the United States in order to take away funding status, legal status. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=818.16s)]
*  This is part of Project 2025. If you read Project 2025, they've included their plan for [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=824.4s)]
*  Palestinian civil society advocacy. And I think people should be very well aware of what that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  Trump is no friend to the Palestinian people, the Muslim people, Arab Americans, or anti-war [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=839.36s)]
*  progressives. A question that I would ask almost any single issue voter, whether it's about climate [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=845.84s)]
*  change or it's about reproductive rights or about Israel and Palestine, is sure, in a vacuum, you [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=851.84s)]
*  should absolutely vote with that interest and only that interest in mind. That said, when there are [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=859.84s)]
*  so many people that are concerned about a whole host of issues that they think might slip through [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=867.52s)]
*  the cracks and have a devastating consequence, how do you tell those voters to say, okay, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  you really should be concerned most about Palestine and maybe withhold your vote even if Donald Trump [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=880.56s)]
*  becomes president? I think what we're trying to communicate to those voters is that we're taking [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=887.36s)]
*  it to the Democratic Party convention to get a shift in policy and that it's incumbent on [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  Vice President Harris to listen to these voters and earn their support. We have 700,000 voters [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=897.28s)]
*  who voted uncommitted, who want to see something, and that their 10 months of activism, their 10 [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=902.72s)]
*  months of organizing, their 10 months of protesting this war has been recognized by this Democratic [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=908.48s)]
*  Party. It's been recognized by the candidate that she sees these voters as part of the Democratic [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=914.48s)]
*  Party and not antithetical to it. I think many people feel very alienated from President Biden. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  I think elections are essentially about choosing what organizing terrain you want to be involved [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=925.9200000000001s)]
*  in. Obviously, no one expects the president to align completely with their views on every single [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=930.1600000000001s)]
*  topic, but I do think that it's about who you're advocating against, who you're pressuring, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=934.88s)]
*  and I think Vice President Harris would be more open to that pressure than Donald Trump and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  JD Vance. The last thing I'll say is when people, the amount of human suffering that young people [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=944.0s)]
*  have seen on their social media for the past 10 months, when Muslim and Arab Americans see [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=951.36s)]
*  people with faces and names like theirs completely dehumanized, children with limbs falling apart, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=956.64s)]
*  women wailing for their husbands and children, I think people's spirits are very, very [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=964.24s)]
*  in need of some healing and repair, and I hope that Vice President Harris can unite people around [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=971.84s)]
*  a vision for the country and for the world that speaks to that pain that people are feeling. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=976.48s)]
*  What if she says back to you, okay, I hear what you're saying, but you know what, I'm still not [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=981.68s)]
*  the president. What would you also like Joe Biden to do between now and then, and what if Kamala [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  Harris says, I will try to make this a priority once I get into office, right, versus somebody who [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=993.28s)]
*  can say, let me do something about this right now? I think people are willing to hear what the vice [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1000.8s)]
*  president has to say. I think people are willing to have an exchange of ideas and thought process, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1006.72s)]
*  but what I would say back to her is, look, after the convention, this delegation and the 700,000 [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1013.44s)]
*  voters it's accountable to could tell people that we had a meeting and while we opposed Trump, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  Vice President Harris didn't meet the things that we wanted her to meet, or they could go out to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1027.28s)]
*  their communities and say, Vice President Harris heard us and I think she would do a lot to change [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1032.08s)]
*  the conditions for Palestinians on the ground and Palestinian Americans in the United States, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1037.36s)]
*  and she will move toward having a balanced approach toward Israel in which we don't send [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1042.6399999999999s)]
*  unrestricted weapons aid. Just this week, Keir Starmer's government was, the Times of Israel [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  reported this, and in the United Kingdom, the new labor government has said they are moving toward [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1055.04s)]
*  an arms embargo on Israel themselves. This is the United States' biggest ally. I don't think it's [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1059.2s)]
*  far-fetched for the United States to follow what the United Kingdom is expected to do in the coming [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1063.6000000000001s)]
*  weeks. So I would tell Vice President Harris she has a chance to excite people, to give enthusiasm [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1068.88s)]
*  to voters that otherwise weren't enthusiastic about voting for Democrats in this election, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1074.0s)]
*  or people will maybe be silent, maybe sit on their hands a little bit. They won't vote for Trump, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1078.4s)]
*  but they won't go out there and knock doors in their communities in states like Michigan or Georgia. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1083.68s)]
*  Waleed Shaheed, Democratic Strategist and co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1088.16s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. Thank you. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFkRH8ZOnw&t=1092.0s)]
