# Veteran Elliot Ackerman’s Stories From the Battlefield  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [July 26, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss)
*  Indeed, Afghanistan is America's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=0.0s)]
*  longest conflict. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=2.1s)]
*  In the last 24 hours, a string [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=3.4s)]
*  of deadly attacks has rocked [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=5.64s)]
*  the country, killing and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=7.2s)]
*  wounding dozens of civilians. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=8.64s)]
*  This comes after President [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Trump on Monday insisted that he [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=11.98s)]
*  could easily win the 18-year [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=14.18s)]
*  war but didn't want to, quote, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=16.04s)]
*  kill 10 million people. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=17.62s)]
*  It's a battlefield that our next [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=19.78s)]
*  guest knows all too well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=21.32s)]
*  As a decorated Marine veteran, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=22.82s)]
*  Elliot Ackerman served five [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=24.62s)]
*  tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=26.46s)]
*  He's brought back with him [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  stories both of heroism and the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=30.0s)]
*  surprising and more mundane [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=32.06s)]
*  realities that are usually left [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=34.56s)]
*  out of the Hollywood epics. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=36.5s)]
*  He spoke to our Walter Isaacson [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=38.44s)]
*  about his new memoir, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=39.84s)]
*  Places and Names on War, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=41.18s)]
*  Revolution, and Returning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=43.28s)]
*  Elliot, welcome to the show. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=47.32s)]
*  And congratulations on this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=47.94s)]
*  memoir. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  You go back, and you find people [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=49.92s)]
*  who were fighting on the other [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=52.22s)]
*  side from you when you were a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  lieutenant in the Marine Corps. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=55.46s)]
*  And you find people who were [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  fighting for different factions. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=58.66s)]
*  What did you learn from them? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=60.779999999999994s)]
*  I think what I learned was there [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=64.11999999999999s)]
*  were lots of areas where there [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=65.16s)]
*  were real similarities. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=67.32s)]
*  So at a certain point, I sat [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  down with a former member of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and we actually stuck [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=71.8s)]
*  up a friendship and had a number [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=72.89999999999999s)]
*  of meetings afterwards. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  And there was a curiosity about [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=76.9s)]
*  one another. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=78.44s)]
*  When were you the most afraid? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=79.34s)]
*  What was the most difficult [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=81.0s)]
*  thing about fighting us? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=81.9s)]
*  We asked each other these [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=83.24s)]
*  questions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=84.08s)]
*  And those were areas where we [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  had lots of overlap. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  We had fought in the same places [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  and we'd been in the country at [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=91.06s)]
*  the same time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  But then ultimately there were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=94.7s)]
*  some areas where there wasn't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=95.4s)]
*  overlap. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=96.34s)]
*  And most of those areas were [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=97.0s)]
*  ideological. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=98.14s)]
*  My one friend Abu Hussar, who I [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  write about in the book, he [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=101.48s)]
*  still believes and adheres to a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=102.7s)]
*  strand of Islam, which is pretty [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  radical, the one that I don't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  subscribe to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=109.12s)]
*  And he looks at my vision of the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  world and can't relate to it as [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  well. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=114.26s)]
*  So there's areas of overlap and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=114.98s)]
*  there's areas where there isn't [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=116.56s)]
*  as much common ground. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=118.0s)]
*  But I think it shouldn't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=118.94s)]
*  necessarily be surprising that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=120.24s)]
*  it's the veterans of these wars [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=121.78s)]
*  who at the end are the ones who [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=123.48s)]
*  start to try to reach out to one [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=125.38s)]
*  another. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=126.92s)]
*  There's a wonderful scene where [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=127.44s)]
*  you're drawing the Euphrates [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=129.38s)]
*  River, is it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=130.62s)]
*  And you're showing the band and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  each of you marks, I was here, I [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=133.06s)]
*  was here, I fought here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=135.46s)]
*  And you figure out where you may [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=137.06s)]
*  have overlapped. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=138.1s)]
*  Well, the first time we sat down [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=139.86s)]
*  there was a moment where my [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=141.3s)]
*  friend who'd come with us, who [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=143.36s)]
*  was Syrian, and he had actually [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=144.94s)]
*  been an activist, a nonviolent [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=146.1s)]
*  activist in the revolution, he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  was translating for us. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=149.02s)]
*  And he went on translating it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=150.52s)]
*  for us for about three hours and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=151.72s)]
*  then he needed a break. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=153.12s)]
*  And so suddenly it was myself [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=154.16s)]
*  and Abu Hassar and we couldn't [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=156.1s)]
*  talk to one another. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=158.26s)]
*  And so it's sort of like it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  became as awkward as like two [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=160.56s)]
*  eighth graders on their first [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=162.6s)]
*  date, you know, like looking at [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=163.74s)]
*  my hands. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  And so we sketched this diagonal [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=165.34s)]
*  line across the page, which he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=169.34s)]
*  recognizes as Euphrates. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  And then he wrote the name of a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=171.74s)]
*  place and handed me the number [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=174.08s)]
*  next to it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  And then he handed me a pencil [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=177.04s)]
*  and I realized what he was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=178.7s)]
*  doing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=179.54s)]
*  And I put a number next to his [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=179.84s)]
*  number. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=180.94s)]
*  And then he wrote a place and a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=181.54s)]
*  number and I put a number next [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=182.5s)]
*  to his number. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=183.54s)]
*  And sort of as we once chased [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  each other around the country, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  our hands were chasing each [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=187.64s)]
*  other around this map. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=188.54s)]
*  And we were trying to see if the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=190.04s)]
*  numbers, meaning the dates, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=191.72s)]
*  lined up in these places. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=193.62s)]
*  And what I realized in that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=195.48s)]
*  moment was that that was a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  language of places and names [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=199.12s)]
*  that even if my friend, Abed, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=200.76s)]
*  who was translating for us, had [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=203.0s)]
*  been there, he wouldn't have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=204.22s)]
*  been able to translate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=205.26s)]
*  And that was a common language [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=206.62s)]
*  that Abu Asar and I shared. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=208.58s)]
*  And you call your memoir [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=210.02s)]
*  Places and Names. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=211.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=212.22s)]
*  Is that from that? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=212.72s)]
*  It is from that, but it's also [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=214.22s)]
*  from I think a whole breadth of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=215.22s)]
*  writing about the wartime [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  experience that really is trying [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=218.52s)]
*  to distill down what going to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=220.36s)]
*  war is in a way that's devoid of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=223.8s)]
*  the rhetoric of ideology, all of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=227.3s)]
*  the flourishes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=229.3s)]
*  What is the truth of this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=229.9s)]
*  experience? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=231.1s)]
*  And it's often been said at the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=231.84s)]
*  end of the day, the only thing [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=233.04s)]
*  you can say about the experience [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=234.08s)]
*  and the only truth of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=236.0s)]
*  experience are the places, the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=237.0s)]
*  dates, the names where people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=239.0s)]
*  fought. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  And that's the only thing that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  is really just devoid of all the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  grand rhetoric that often [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=243.64s)]
*  accompanies war. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=245.33999999999997s)]
*  Don't other wars have not only [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=246.33999999999997s)]
*  that grand rhetoric but that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=248.94s)]
*  deep meaning compared to these [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=250.78s)]
*  20 years now of wars we've been [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=253.48s)]
*  fighting in the Middle East [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  where we're still struggling to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  find? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=257.82s)]
*  What was the meaning of these? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=258.32s)]
*  You know, sir, I think in the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=260.96s)]
*  past we've had wars that have [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  had at least a clearer beginning, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=264.12s)]
*  middle, and end. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=266.92s)]
*  And one of the things that's been [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=267.92s)]
*  unique about these forever wars [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=269.62s)]
*  is they've been termed, meaning [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=271.82000000000005s)]
*  I would say our 9-11 wars, is [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=273.02000000000004s)]
*  that they haven't ended. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's put the people who [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=276.24s)]
*  fought in them in an interesting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=277.36s)]
*  position. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=279.26000000000005s)]
*  And what I mean by that is that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=279.94s)]
*  for each person who's left the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=281.54s)]
*  wars, like I have, at a certain [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=282.88s)]
*  point you've had to declare your [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=285.24s)]
*  own separate peace and say the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=287.04s)]
*  war is over for me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  So there hasn't been a surrender [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=289.68s)]
*  ceremony on a battleship or [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=292.38s)]
*  even helicopters taking off from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=294.04s)]
*  the roof of the embassy in Saigon [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  for Vietnam. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  For us, each of us who's left has [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=299.8s)]
*  had to at a certain point, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=301.1s)]
*  frankly, turn to your friends who [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=302.6s)]
*  are still deploying and say, hey, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=304.0s)]
*  guys, this is the last one for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  me, I'm leaving. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  And that is a complicated [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=308.74s)]
*  decision. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  You got the silver star for your [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  fighting in the Second Battle of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=313.12s)]
*  Fallujah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  And yet throughout your memoir, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=315.72s)]
*  you hardly talk about it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=317.26s)]
*  And then at the very end, there's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=319.12s)]
*  a citation you get and you [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=320.6s)]
*  annotate it and describe it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=322.68s)]
*  Why did you do it that way? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  When I had read that summary of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=326.98s)]
*  action in the past, I always felt [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  that it was incomplete. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  It was incomplete sort of of the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=331.56s)]
*  many humanizing moments of what [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  went on during the battle. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=335.1s)]
*  Give me an example of that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=337.5s)]
*  For instance, there's a part in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  it where they talk about a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  situation where I had to go run [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  out and coordinate with [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=345.16s)]
*  a pair of tanks that were trying [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=347.54s)]
*  to shoot at insurgent positions. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  It's very difficult to tank [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  this for tanks to see. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=352.41999999999996s)]
*  So I was an infantryman, so I ran [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=353.61999999999995s)]
*  out to the tanks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=354.96s)]
*  On the back of the tanks, they [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=356.26s)]
*  have a little phone. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=357.4s)]
*  They call it the grunt phone. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=358.96s)]
*  And it's basically just a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=360.4s)]
*  receiver. So you run you you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=361.84s)]
*  make the run of your life out [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=363.88s)]
*  into the street and you can see [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=365.58s)]
*  you can see the bullets [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=366.78s)]
*  impacting on a tank. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's like you're sliding into [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=369.02s)]
*  home plate. You get there, you [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  get to the grunt phone, you're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=371.32s)]
*  crouched behind this tank and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=372.88s)]
*  you can hear the bullet impacts [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  on the tank. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=375.55999999999995s)]
*  And you're trying to tell these [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  tankers where to shoot. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  So I grabbed that grunt phone, I [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  hold it to my ear. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  And you know what I heard? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  Britney Spears. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=383.38s)]
*  Maybe hit me one more time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  Because the tankers would play [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=386.52s)]
*  on their internal communication [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=388.76s)]
*  system. They weren't talking to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=390.7s)]
*  each other. They would play [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  music. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=392.32s)]
*  And later on, the tank commander [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=393.32s)]
*  said, oh, yes, sir, you know, we [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  keep the music going. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  So everybody in the tank stays [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=397.4s)]
*  really frosty, very cool. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=398.64s)]
*  And so the surreality [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  of being in a firefight, taking [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=403.34s)]
*  the grunt phone to your ear and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=404.9s)]
*  hearing Britney Spears, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=405.7s)]
*  that's never going to make it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=407.84s)]
*  into an official war citation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=408.84s)]
*  But I want people to know that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  because that's that is as true [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  as anything else. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=415.4s)]
*  But I'd say also one of the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=416.24s)]
*  overarching things that never [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  gets in there, too, is the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  complexity. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=419.68s)]
*  I mean, any of these awards and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=421.84s)]
*  in just remembering the wars, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  whether it's an award associated [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  to it or not, I say you're [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=426.68s)]
*  you're often being honored [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=429.02s)]
*  for what is in some respects the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=430.96s)]
*  worst day of your life, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=432.86s)]
*  because they only hand out these [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=434.76s)]
*  awards when everything goes [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=436.32s)]
*  wrong, when everything goes [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=437.56s)]
*  right. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  You're just doing your job and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=439.76s)]
*  there's no need to hand out the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=440.64s)]
*  awards. So there's a there's a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=441.58s)]
*  real duality to that experience. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  What causes courage? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  I think it's interesting. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=449.52s)]
*  Courage is an emotion. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=452.02s)]
*  What causes bravery? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=455.22s)]
*  Well, fear is an emotion. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=456.36s)]
*  So people say courage is the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=457.72s)]
*  opposite of fear, but that's not [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=458.7s)]
*  really true. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=459.8s)]
*  So I know what it feels like to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=460.8s)]
*  be afraid. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=462.16s)]
*  I've been afraid many times in my [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=463.2s)]
*  life, but I've never felt [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=464.7s)]
*  brave. I've never felt courage. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  So I've seen Marines do [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=469.32s)]
*  incredibly brave things for one [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=470.42s)]
*  another. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=471.62s)]
*  And it's always [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  actually out of love. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=474.56s)]
*  Love is the opposite of fear. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  The reason people are able to. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=478.3s)]
*  Successfully conquer their fears [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=481.44s)]
*  is out of love for one another. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=483.8s)]
*  But there's this interesting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=486.0s)]
*  paradox, this and obvious that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=487.1s)]
*  exists in war, which is. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=488.68s)]
*  You know, a group of people get [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=491.94s)]
*  together, they have to go to war. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=492.88s)]
*  They train for months and months. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  They form these bonds in the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=496.48s)]
*  military. We call it a sprit of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=497.68s)]
*  core, you know, cohesion, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=498.84s)]
*  whatever you want to call it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  And that cohesion, basically, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=501.68s)]
*  those bonds of friendship, of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=503.38s)]
*  camaraderie, they're basically [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=504.62s)]
*  just another word for love. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=505.58s)]
*  So you build these bonds of love [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=507.18s)]
*  so that you can go to war and [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=508.92s)]
*  you're going to war and you have [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=510.18s)]
*  a mission. The reason you're [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  there is to accomplish a mission. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=512.16s)]
*  And the mission always comes [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=513.5s)]
*  first. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=514.76s)]
*  It comes before the men because [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=516.0s)]
*  otherwise you wouldn't even go on [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=518.66s)]
*  the mission. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=519.86s)]
*  So you've got a group of people [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=520.66s)]
*  who've been trained, who love one [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=522.16s)]
*  another, who have to achieve a [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=523.56s)]
*  mission. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=524.84s)]
*  And ultimately, they're sacrificed [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=526.1s)]
*  to achieve the mission. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=527.9s)]
*  And so sort of the nature of war [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=528.7s)]
*  at the end of the day, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=530.4s)]
*  particularly at the higher ends, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=531.54s)]
*  is that you have to go out and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=532.9399999999999s)]
*  sacrifice the thing you love. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=534.84s)]
*  You have to destroy the very [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=537.08s)]
*  thing you love. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=538.08s)]
*  And then you come back and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=539.14s)]
*  oftentimes people feel this sense [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=540.98s)]
*  of heartbreak. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=542.24s)]
*  But, you know, your heart can't [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=544.02s)]
*  break unless you are in love. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=545.38s)]
*  You fought in the nine eleven [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=548.16s)]
*  wars, meaning Iraq and then [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=549.82s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=551.7s)]
*  That sort of melds in history [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=553.7s)]
*  and in your book into what I [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  would call the Arab Spring Wars, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  like Syria. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=559.68s)]
*  Does the United States have [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=560.9799999999999s)]
*  either the ability or the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  awareness of being involved in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=564.92s)]
*  this situation? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, I think one of the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  things that we as Americans often [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=570.2199999999999s)]
*  do is we believe we are the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  central actors, the protagonists [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=574.8599999999999s)]
*  in every single story. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=576.66s)]
*  And that's obviously gotten us [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=578.1999999999999s)]
*  into a lot of trouble in the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=579.28s)]
*  past. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=580.2399999999999s)]
*  And when I've spent time in Iraq, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  Syria, Turkey, it's very clear on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  the ground that we are not the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=588.68s)]
*  central actors. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=589.68s)]
*  The central actors in these [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=590.3399999999999s)]
*  conflicts are obviously the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  people who live there, who are [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=593.78s)]
*  trying to determine the future of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=594.9799999999999s)]
*  their own countries. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=596.28s)]
*  And we as Americans are ancillary [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=597.02s)]
*  actors, much as the Iranians are, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=599.4599999999999s)]
*  much as the Russians are. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=601.16s)]
*  And we have a part to play, but [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=602.16s)]
*  not the central part to play. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  Because we as Americans often [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=605.06s)]
*  believe that there's just sort of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=606.26s)]
*  this policy alchemy that if we [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=607.56s)]
*  can just get it right, all of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=610.5999999999999s)]
*  these issues will be solved. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  And they're not necessarily for [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=614.56s)]
*  us to solve. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=616.1999999999999s)]
*  And they're for these people to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=617.06s)]
*  solve for themselves. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=618.02s)]
*  And we can play an important [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=618.92s)]
*  supporting role, but a supporting [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  role nevertheless. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=621.5s)]
*  You came from a wealthy family, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=622.9s)]
*  in a way. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=624.9s)]
*  Your father is a financier. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  Your mother is a great novelist [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=626.8s)]
*  and writer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=628.4s)]
*  You have a brother, I think he's [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=628.98s)]
*  a mathematician and a wrestler. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=630.4399999999999s)]
*  And yet you enlisted. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=632.8199999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=634.3399999999999s)]
*  I think three reasons. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=636.8399999999999s)]
*  First was I wanted a job where [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=639.28s)]
*  whether I was good at my job or [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  bad at my job matter. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=642.8199999999999s)]
*  I wanted real responsibility at [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=645.1s)]
*  a relatively young age. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=646.7s)]
*  I grew up overseas for part of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=648.98s)]
*  my youth at least. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=651.6400000000001s)]
*  And I think being an outsider [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=652.84s)]
*  looking at America just gave me [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=654.1400000000001s)]
*  an appreciation I might not have [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=655.98s)]
*  otherwise had. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=657.38s)]
*  So maybe I want to give something [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=658.12s)]
*  back. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=659.12s)]
*  And lastly, I always had an [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=660.38s)]
*  innate interest in the military. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=662.72s)]
*  I was sort of that kid who never [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=664.86s)]
*  stopped playing with his G.I. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=665.86s)]
*  Joes. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=666.96s)]
*  And sort of the confluence of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=667.36s)]
*  those three things led me to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=668.46s)]
*  join the Marine Corps. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  So you joined the Marines and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  you also became part of the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=674.06s)]
*  Special Forces there, right? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=675.4s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=676.8s)]
*  So describe that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=677.26s)]
*  Well, it was, you know, I when [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=679.56s)]
*  I joined the Marines, I went [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=682.4599999999999s)]
*  into the infantry, which is what [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=683.4599999999999s)]
*  one usually would do. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=684.9s)]
*  And then I had the opportunity [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=685.86s)]
*  after three years to go into [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=686.76s)]
*  Marine Special Operations where [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  I served in Afghanistan as an [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=689.4s)]
*  adviser to Afghan troops. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=692.3s)]
*  So a small team of about a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=695.38s)]
*  dozen Marines with about seven [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=696.5799999999999s)]
*  or eight hundred Afghans. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=698.54s)]
*  And the Afghans we advise were [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=699.78s)]
*  part of an Afghan Commando [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=700.74s)]
*  Battalion. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=702.08s)]
*  And our mission was to run, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=703.0200000000001s)]
*  capture, kill operations against [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=706.4200000000001s)]
*  senior Taliban leadership in [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=708.2s)]
*  Western Afghanistan. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=709.86s)]
*  And you said that when you [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=711.34s)]
*  killed somebody in war, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=713.14s)]
*  it felt like murder. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=715.5400000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=717.34s)]
*  I wrote that specifically about [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=719.34s)]

*  where we had moved very deep [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=723.5400000000001s)]
*  into the city and we basically [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=726.22s)]
*  set up in an ambush and the sun [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=728.98s)]
*  came up one morning and we saw [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=731.88s)]
*  a group of insurgents who were [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=733.38s)]
*  basically walking up to the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=734.42s)]
*  front line and we initiated our [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=735.58s)]
*  ambush. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=737.62s)]
*  You know, they weren't expecting [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=739.62s)]
*  it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=740.7s)]
*  You know, and in those moments, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=741.26s)]
*  that's what it is. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=742.76s)]
*  That's the nature of war. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=743.4s)]
*  You know, the nature of war. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=744.46s)]
*  And Klauswitz said it in the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=745.66s)]
*  18th century. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=747.8s)]
*  You know, the nature of war is [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=748.9s)]
*  slaughter. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=749.9s)]
*  And lest you ever be confused [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=750.9399999999999s)]
*  about that, that's what it's [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=753.54s)]
*  about at the end of the day. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=754.6s)]
*  And you think it would be useful [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=756.0s)]
*  for at least most Americans to [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=757.9s)]
*  have the potential or [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=759.92s)]
*  possibility of being exposed to [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=761.62s)]
*  that before we go to war again? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  I think it would actually be the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=765.26s)]
*  quickest way to bring us to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=766.5s)]
*  peace. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=767.56s)]
*  I think these wars in Iraq and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=768.66s)]
*  Afghanistan that have gone on [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  for 18 years, they haven't gone [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=771.16s)]
*  on for 18 years because we [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=772.4s)]
*  haven't been able to find the [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=773.5999999999999s)]
*  exact calibration of policies to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=775.14s)]
*  bring them to an end. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=777.24s)]
*  They've gone on for 18 years [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=778.3399999999999s)]
*  because we've allowed them to go [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=779.64s)]
*  on for 18 years. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=781.28s)]
*  Imagine in this country, you [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=783.28s)]
*  know, we just finished a few [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=784.68s)]
*  months ago the furor over this [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=785.78s)]
*  college admissions scandal where [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=788.44s)]
*  we saw what elite families in [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=790.34s)]
*  this country would be willing to [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=792.5400000000001s)]
*  do, the lengths they would be [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=793.5400000000001s)]
*  willing to go to to get their [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=794.5400000000001s)]
*  children into college. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=795.8800000000001s)]
*  Imagine if those same families [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=797.6400000000001s)]
*  of elites had a child who was [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=799.1800000000001s)]
*  eligible for the draft, even if [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=802.7600000000001s)]
*  it was a one in 20 chance that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  that child would be drafted into [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=806.1600000000001s)]
*  the U.S. military. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=807.4000000000001s)]
*  Do you think we would still be [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=809.22s)]
*  fighting an 18-year-old war in [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=810.62s)]
*  Afghanistan? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=812.1600000000001s)]
*  Or do you think we would be [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=813.36s)]
*  flirting with the idea of going [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=814.7s)]
*  to war in Iran? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=816.2s)]
*  It would be far more difficult to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=818.3599999999999s)]
*  continue these forever wars and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=820.74s)]
*  to engage in wars in the future. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=822.74s)]
*  So when I say I support a draft, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=824.74s)]
*  I don't support a draft for the [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=826.9399999999999s)]
*  militarization of America. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=828.74s)]
*  Support it for the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=831.28s)]
*  demilitarization of American [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=832.28s)]
*  society. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=833.42s)]
*  How would you structure it? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=834.52s)]
*  People often assume that a draft [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=836.12s)]
*  means everyone who serves in the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=837.5799999999999s)]
*  military is conscripted. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=838.66s)]
*  And it's never been that way. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=839.9799999999999s)]
*  It's always been a percentage. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=840.9799999999999s)]
*  In fact, the majority of people [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=842.38s)]
*  who fought in Vietnam were not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=844.26s)]
*  actually draftees. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=845.4s)]
*  They were volunteers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  So a draft could be as little as [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=847.52s)]
*  10%, 5% of the U.S. military. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=850.14s)]
*  But having a limited component [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=852.54s)]
*  would have a significant result [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=854.44s)]
*  in all Americans feeling like [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=857.9s)]
*  they had some skin in the game [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=859.58s)]
*  if there was potential that they [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=860.54s)]
*  themselves or their child could [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=862.12s)]
*  be drafted. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=863.34s)]
*  But it wouldn't necessarily [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=864.44s)]
*  diminish the overall effectiveness [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=865.44s)]
*  of the armed forces. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=867.12s)]
*  Another criticism that has come [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=869.12s)]
*  up in the past, and you [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=870.48s)]
*  particularly saw it with Vietnam, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=871.32s)]
*  was this idea that people with [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=872.56s)]
*  means, people who are well-to-do [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=876.64s)]
*  or connected will be able to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=877.94s)]
*  find some type of deferment and [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=879.18s)]
*  way to get out of the draft. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=880.52s)]
*  And I think that's worth looking [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=881.48s)]
*  at. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=882.46s)]
*  And so I would suggest that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=883.12s)]
*  people who are drafted only be [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=885.32s)]
*  allowed to go into combat arms, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=887.26s)]
*  meaning the infantry, tanks, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=889.7s)]
*  places where you fight. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=891.02s)]
*  It would be men and women because [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=891.72s)]
*  women can serve in every single [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=892.92s)]
*  capacity of the U.S. military [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=894.36s)]
*  now. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=895.6s)]
*  And furthermore, that the people [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=896.5s)]
*  who would be eligible for the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=899.1s)]
*  draft would be children whose [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=900.26s)]
*  families register in the top [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=902.9s)]
*  income bracket of this country. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=904.7s)]
*  So that you wouldn't wind up with [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=906.66s)]
*  a war like Vietnam where only [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=908.26s)]
*  people who were of lower [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=910.0600000000001s)]
*  socioeconomic status were [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=911.16s)]
*  drafted while people who were [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=912.66s)]
*  wealthy were able to get out of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=913.66s)]
*  the draft through student [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=914.9s)]
*  deferments or well-connected [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  podiatrists, for instance. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=918.46s)]
*  In your novels and in your [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=920.24s)]
*  memoir, you talk about a sense [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=921.9s)]
*  of purpose. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=923.7s)]
*  When you left the military, did [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=924.6800000000001s)]
*  you feel for a while that there [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=926.6800000000001s)]
*  was even in your life no longer [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=928.74s)]
*  the exact feeling of purpose? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=931.02s)]
*  One of the things the military [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=934.9200000000001s)]
*  does is it gives you a very [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=936.4799999999999s)]
*  acute and clear sense of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=938.68s)]
*  purpose. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=940.68s)]
*  And I think all of us, to be [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=941.68s)]
*  happy in life, we need to have a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=944.4799999999999s)]
*  purpose. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=947.18s)]
*  So to give you a very basic [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=948.18s)]
*  example, there's a man, he works [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=950.12s)]
*  a job, that job puts food on the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=951.7199999999999s)]
*  table for his family, sees his [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=953.06s)]
*  family grow. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=954.6999999999999s)]
*  They then get a better education [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=956.0999999999999s)]
*  than him. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=958.6999999999999s)]
*  That gives him his purpose and [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=959.6999999999999s)]
*  from that he drives his [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=960.6999999999999s)]
*  happiness. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=961.6999999999999s)]
*  When you go up to the war at 19, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=962.6999999999999s)]
*  20 years old, you develop a [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=964.56s)]
*  dysfunctional relationship with [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=967.06s)]
*  purpose because it's so intense. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=968.42s)]
*  You have a mission, let's say, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=970.12s)]
*  to secure a mountaintop in [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=971.9s)]
*  Afghanistan or a few city blocks [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=973.26s)]
*  in Baghdad. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=974.96s)]
*  You're trying to achieve that [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=975.96s)]
*  mission with a group of people [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=977.04s)]
*  who will probably become some of [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=978.5s)]
*  your very best friends. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=979.8s)]
*  So if purpose is this drug that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=981.44s)]
*  induces happiness, at 19 or 20 [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=982.98s)]
*  years old, you're sort of [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=985.84s)]
*  free-basing the crystal meth of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=987.24s)]
*  purpose. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=989.08s)]
*  There is nothing more intense [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=990.08s)]
*  than what you are going to do. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=991.18s)]
*  And you do that for two years, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=993.0s)]
*  three years, four years, however [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=994.64s)]
*  long you're going to do it and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  eventually you have to come home. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=997.0799999999999s)]
*  When you come home, you have to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=998.5799999999999s)]
*  repurpose yourself. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=999.9799999999999s)]
*  So maybe you're going to go back [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1001.54s)]
*  to college, maybe you're going to [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1002.7199999999999s)]
*  get a job at Home Depot or sell [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1004.12s)]
*  real estate, whatever you're [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1005.92s)]
*  going to do. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1006.92s)]
*  And you look at the various [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1008.16s)]
*  things you can go do and the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1009.5799999999999s)]
*  various purposes, and they're not [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1010.68s)]
*  that crystal meth of purpose, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1012.02s)]
*  they're like coolers light. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1013.66s)]
*  And you realize that you're going [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  to spend the rest of your life [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1017.5s)]
*  basically sitting on your front [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1018.5s)]
*  porch drinking coolers light in a [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1019.6999999999999s)]
*  certain depression sets in. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1022.36s)]
*  And there's people I know who [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1025.16s)]
*  have acute PTSD, flashbacks, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1026.7s)]
*  nightmares, things like that, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1029.1000000000001s)]
*  and that's a very real thing. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1030.1000000000001s)]
*  There's a far greater swath of [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1031.74s)]
*  people I know who've wrestled [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1033.0s)]
*  with something much more [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1035.3s)]
*  insidiousness. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1036.3s)]
*  It's that type of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1037.3s)]
*  purposelessness. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1038.3s)]
*  And for myself coming back, I [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1039.3s)]
*  needed to repurpose myself. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1040.58s)]
*  I did that by becoming a writer, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1041.94s)]
*  becoming a journalist, and that's [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1043.88s)]
*  allowed me to channel that [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1046.54s)]
*  energy into something positive. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1047.72s)]
*  But I think for anyone, when you [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1049.42s)]
*  feel as though you've reached the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  summit of something, you then [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1051.94s)]
*  have to reckon with the descent. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1053.94s)]
*  You take your kids occasionally, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1055.94s)]
*  and I think on July 4th, to walk [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  through Arlington Cemetery, right? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1060.5800000000002s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1062.28s)]
*  Do you want them to join the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1063.28s)]
*  military? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1064.8200000000002s)]
*  Do you feel it would be [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1065.8200000000002s)]
*  important for them? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1066.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1067.8200000000002s)]
*  I want them to do whatever they [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1068.8200000000002s)]
*  want to do. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1070.3200000000002s)]
*  I want them to be free and [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1071.3200000000002s)]
*  unencumbered by any experiences [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1072.3200000000002s)]
*  that I've had and to live their [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1074.2s)]
*  lives. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  What I do do, though, is I want [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1080.96s)]
*  them to know who I am. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1082.7s)]
*  And I tell them stories. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1083.7s)]
*  I tell them stories about my [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1084.7s)]
*  friends as a way to honor my [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1085.7s)]
*  friends, particularly my friends [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1086.7s)]
*  who are at Arlington, because in [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1087.7s)]
*  my mind, my kids know the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1088.7s)]
*  stories. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1089.7s)]
*  If they know about Doug [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1090.7s)]
*  Zembeck or Dan Malcolm or Aaron [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1091.7s)]
*  Torian, and they remember those [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1092.7s)]
*  stories and they remember going [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1093.7s)]
*  there with me, maybe they'll tell [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1094.7s)]
*  their kids and then my friends [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1095.7s)]
*  get to live. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1096.7s)]
*  Elliot, thank you for joining [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhofwNum-ss&t=1097.7s)]
