Video Description: Europe, Ukraine and much of the world are reeling after senior American officials sent a clear message at the Munich Security Conference: European security is no longer an American priority. The United States' new direction is already in place as high-level Russian and American teams arrive in Saudi Arabia this week for bilateral talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Notably absent is Ukraine itself. President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit Saudi Arabia this week, but he is not part of the negotiation. Europe is also not invited. European leaders pulled together an emergency meeting in Paris, facing the possibility they may have to implement a Ukraine peace deal despite having no say in it. Munich was ground zero for this weekend's world-changing events. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was keynote speaker at the security conference there, where. Christiane spoke with him about his plans to speak for Ukraine — even as the U.S. and Russia exclude him from the table.

# Pres. Zelensky Speaks for Ukraine Amid Exclusion From U.S.-Russia Peace Talks | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo)
*  You, after your phone call with President Trump, said that you did not hear enough detail [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=0.0s)]
*  to make this a peace plan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=6.54s)]
*  Can you just elaborate what you meant by that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=8.82s)]
*  Can I speak Ukrainian? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=12.76s)]
*  No. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=13.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=14.76s)]
*  Don't pressure on me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=15.76s)]
*  Okay, so, yeah, we had really a long conversation with the President of the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=20.76s)]
*  Not first one and not last, I'm sure. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=28.36s)]
*  I mean, really between us, I'm not sure that by phone we can manage all the plan, all security [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=31.64s)]
*  guarantees with all the details because, you know, devil in details. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=37.64s)]
*  Yes, and we know where is this devil in what country now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=41.72s)]
*  Yes, that's why we have to stop him, to stop Putin, and it's very important for me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=47.16s)]
*  That's why the atmosphere of our discussion is good, but really it's always good. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=54.4s)]
*  Yes, but we need urgent, very concrete steps. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=60.96s)]
*  And I think we have to work on it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=65.32s)]
*  Our teams, we began, but I think that we have to start immediately to do more deep decisions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=68.14s)]
*  We'll get into that in a moment, but you did also have a separate conversation with Vice [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  President J.D. Vance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=84.0s)]
*  We have to bring up that in 2022, J.D. Vance said he didn't, and this is a quote, I don't [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=85.44s)]
*  care what happens to Ukraine one way or another. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Do you feel that he's changed, that the Trump administration and the actors you're dealing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  with understand what's at stake? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=97.24s)]
*  I'll be honest, we have to work on it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=100.28s)]
*  All of us, not only me, me is not enough, really. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=108.28s)]
*  I think we have to work because I think that, you know, we, together in Europe, the war [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=112.64s)]
*  is in Europe and America is far from the invasion, and I think that we need to share more details [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=119.76s)]
*  because to my mind there are a lot of different voices around new American administration, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=129.68s)]
*  and I'm not sure that all these voices on our side. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=136.56s)]
*  That's why we have to work with these people, even with some Europeans, as I said, if I [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=142.24s)]
*  was understandable, I don't know about Mar-a-Lago, yeah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=150.08s)]
*  It was clear. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=155.28s)]
*  It was clear, but I want to repeat it, yes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=156.28s)]
*  It's important for them to be clear. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=160.96s)]
*  Do you want to name names while we're at it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=164.96s)]
*  I know names, of course. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=168.36s)]
*  I'm not sure that it's, yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=171.96s)]
*  Let's just get back to President Trump. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=173.56s)]
*  At a press conference... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=175.88s)]
*  You said about Orban. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=176.88s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=177.88s)]
*  Mr. President, Trump was asked whether he trusted Putin, and he sort of basically ended [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=178.88s)]
*  up saying, on this I do, but he has also said that, and frankly it's quite difficult to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=189.96s)]
*  extract what all the different administration officials have been saying. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=196.52s)]
*  On the one hand, potentially that maybe Ukraine had a responsibility for this war. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  Maybe Ukraine can't ever expect to get back. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=207.8s)]
*  It's unrealistic, according to the defense secretary, its territory. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=210.36s)]
*  Maybe Ukraine will be safe and independent. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=215.22s)]
*  Maybe it'll be part of Russia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=218.08s)]
*  Do you understand what America's position is? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  Which is? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=224.96s)]
*  I think, to my mind, they are preparing atmosphere for their dialogue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=226.06s)]
*  For their dialogue? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=232.9s)]
*  Which will be? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=234.46s)]
*  For the dialogue between Trump and Putin. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=235.82s)]
*  And I think this is... [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=239.7s)]
*  I mean, it's up to them, but they can discuss everything they want, but not about Ukraine [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=241.66s)]
*  without us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=248.22s)]
*  That's why, in this case, that's why especially in this case, I think it's a little bit dangerous. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=250.26s)]
*  That's why I said that we need to talk more with the president and to talk more with his [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=256.94s)]
*  people, with his teams. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=262.98s)]
*  We had good conversation, and I think that I opened some new details for vice president. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=265.56s)]
*  That's why I said we need... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=271.78s)]
*  It's not waste time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=274.46s)]
*  It's really very important, I think, diplomatic investment for the future, just and lasting [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=276.62s)]
*  peace for Ukraine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=283.38s)]
*  You said Putin doesn't want peace. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=284.66s)]
*  I mean, you just said it loud and clear here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=286.46s)]
*  So what is the dialogue? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=288.9s)]
*  And have you convinced the Americans that A, Ukraine has to be at the table, and B, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=290.36s)]
*  I guess the Europeans have to convince them that they have to be at the table? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=295.5s)]
*  On all the levels, we directly, yes, very directly, send these messages that we have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=299.94s)]
*  to prepare security guarantees like a main part of the stopping Putin and stop this war, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=312.18s)]
*  and very important, essential, and we say that it can't be without us. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  That's why I don't know if we don't have, from my point of view, if we don't have for [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=326.2s)]
*  today common plan, it means for me that United States doesn't have. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=332.2s)]
*  Because if they have something, it's not about us. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=339.4s)]
*  First of all, we have to make a plan with you, I said to the president. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=343.68s)]
*  It was the day when he had phone calls with Putin and with me, and first with him and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=348.08s)]
*  then with us. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  And how did that sit with you? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=355.96s)]
*  No, I said that… [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=357.11999999999995s)]
*  But first with Putin and then with you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=358.67999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I'm not happy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=362.76s)]
*  Yes, but I think that more dangerous if first meeting will be with Putin and then with Ukraine. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQkf6RHixDo&t=364.47999999999996s)]
