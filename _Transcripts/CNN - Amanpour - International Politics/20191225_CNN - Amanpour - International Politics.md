*  Well, it was a combination of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=43.04s)]
*  things. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=44.44s)]
*  I think there were a group of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=45.7s)]
*  people in the British [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=47.94s)]
*  Conservative Party who, for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=48.78s)]

*  Britain being part of the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=52.72s)]

*  a sort of festering saw within [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=54.88s)]
*  the Conservative Party. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=56.64s)]
*  And David Cameron, the prime [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  minister at the time, decided [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=59.14s)]
*  that putting this issue to a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=60.42s)]
*  referendum would kind of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  blance that boil, if you will, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=63.52s)]
*  and deal with a problem in his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=65.08s)]
*  party. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  And he and everybody around him [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=67.02000000000001s)]
*  was fully expecting to win the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=68.56s)]
*  referendum. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=69.82000000000001s)]
*  It was not something that was [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=71.0s)]
*  high on the agenda of most [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  people in the UK. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=73.9s)]
*  In fact, if you look at polls [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  before the referendum, it was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=76.06s)]
*  nowhere near the top. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  People worried about the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  National Health Service. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=80.04s)]
*  They worried about all manner [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=80.94s)]
*  of things but not Brexit. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=82.0s)]
*  But that, the referendum itself [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=83.7s)]
*  became a vehicle through which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  many people voiced profound [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=88.74s)]
*  frustration. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=90.74s)]
*  It was a protest vote. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  It was a vote of anger not [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=92.74s)]
*  dissimilar to many of the people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=94.44s)]
*  who voted for President Trump in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  2016. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=97.32s)]
*  It was a vote not necessarily for [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=98.38s)]
*  anything in particular. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  It was just a kind of, I'm fed up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  with the status quo. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=102.82s)]
*  And there's an interesting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=104.28s)]
*  English adage that the sort of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=105.56s)]
*  constellation of people who [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=108.22s)]
*  voted for Brexit were these [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=109.36s)]
*  generally affluent conservative [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=111.12s)]
*  voters and then a lot of blue [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  collar workers who were angry [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=115.16s)]
*  and felt left behind. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=117.16s)]
*  And so it's often said that it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=117.96s)]
*  was a collection, it was a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=119.94s)]
*  coordination of blue collars and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=121.6s)]
*  red trousers because those [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=123.64s)]
*  conservative types often wear [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=125.1s)]
*  red trousers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=127.8s)]
*  But so it was this protest vote. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=128.94s)]
*  But since then, what's really [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=130.64s)]
*  striking is it has become the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=132.32s)]
*  fault line in British politics. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's now people identify [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=136.08s)]
*  much more about whether they are [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=138.28s)]
*  a Remainer or a Brexiter than [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=140.18s)]
*  they do about whether they are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=142.08s)]
*  conservative or Labour. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=143.22s)]
*  In Britain, do you think there [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=144.68s)]
*  might be a realignment somehow [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=146.18s)]
*  since the parties don't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  represent the political fault [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=150.58s)]
*  lines? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=151.84s)]
*  Well, it's certainly possible. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, there has already been [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=153.04s)]
*  somewhat of a realignment in the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  sense that the conservative [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=156.68s)]
*  party has become much more of a [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=158.18s)]
*  populist nationalist party than [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  the kind of more moderate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=162.28s)]
*  Which is a little bit like what [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=162.96s)]
*  happened here in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=164.12s)]
*  Republican. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=164.76s)]
*  Which is like what happened [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=165.26s)]
*  here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=165.96s)]
*  The Labour Party has been [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=166.6s)]
*  essentially hijacked by a far [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  left group of people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=170.8s)]
*  And Jeremy Corbyn, who is the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=172.1s)]
*  leader of the British Labour [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=173.96s)]
*  Party, is by far the most left [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=175.12s)]
*  wing leader we've had in the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=177.46s)]
*  Labour Party at least since the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  1930s. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=180.46s)]
*  And he really is a Marxist or [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=181.1s)]
*  close to be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=183.46s)]
*  And he's surrounded by Trotsky [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=184.0s)]
* ists. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=185.3s)]
*  So this is a far left cabal that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=185.6s)]
*  have taken over what was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=188.2s)]
*  traditionally a sort of centre [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=190.1s)]
*  left party under Tony Blair. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=191.18s)]
*  And the irony is if you hadn't [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=192.54s)]
*  had that takeover of the Labour [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=194.48s)]
*  Party, we probably would have [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=195.88s)]
*  seen the whole referendum debate [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=197.94s)]
*  play out very differently. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=199.98s)]
*  So it's because these two [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=201.12s)]
*  earthquakes have taken place in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  the two parties at the same time [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=204.9s)]
*  that we have British politics [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  where it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think you're right that it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  is possible that we will see a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=209.28s)]
*  fracturing because centrist [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=211.18s)]

*  There is, there are important [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=521.76s)]

*  you know, snake oil salesman [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=536.5s)]

*  answers. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=539.3s)]
*  I don't think tariffs are the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=539.8s)]
*  answer. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=541.9s)]
*  I don't think protectionism is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=542.4s)]
*  the answer. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=543.5s)]
*  I don't think a drawbridge-up [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=544.0s)]
*  kind of mentality is the answer. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=545.74s)]
*  But we do need to think about [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=547.94s)]
*  what is a positive agenda [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=549.14s)]

*  positive vision for a 21st [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=552.48s)]

*  citizen. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=554.8s)]
*  Over the next few years, I think [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=555.3s)]
*  that's what this country is [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=556.8s)]
*  going to be grappling towards. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=557.6s)]
*  How old is the economist? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=559.24s)]
*  More than 176 years. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=560.24s)]
*  Now we were founded in 1843. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  And in that period, it has [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  always stood for sort of free [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=566.18s)]
*  minds, free markets, free trade, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=568.18s)]
*  not that ideological, but [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=571.5799999999999s)]
*  believing in what are the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  fundamentals of what I'll call [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=575.22s)]
*  classic liberal democratic [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=577.72s)]
*  capitalism free markets. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  What would you do now to fix [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=582.26s)]
*  that system? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=585.8199999999999s)]
*  We stand for the classic English [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=587.06s)]
*  liberalism. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  And whenever I use the word [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=590.0999999999999s)]
*  liberal in the U.S., I have to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  kind of preface it by saying [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=592.5s)]
*  classic English liberalism [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=593.92s)]
*  because it has a different [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  meaning here, individual freedom, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=596.0s)]
*  economic and political. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=597.76s)]
*  I think that we need to have a [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=599.5s)]
*  very hard rethink about what [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  liberalism in the 21st century [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=604.9799999999999s)]
*  looks like. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=607.14s)]
*  Actually, last year was our [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=607.9799999999999s)]
*  175th anniversary. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  And we marked our anniversary [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  with a cover story and an essay [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=613.5s)]
*  on remaking liberalism, which I [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=616.24s)]
*  took, I actually wrote that essay [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=618.6s)]
*  and sort of spent some weeks in [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=620.28s)]
*  the summer writing it last year. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=621.44s)]
*  And so went through in some [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=623.24s)]
*  detail the areas that, you know, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=624.58s)]
*  were required. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=626.78s)]
*  And I think the, you know, part [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=627.34s)]
*  of it is unleashing genuine [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=628.94s)]
*  competition. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=631.78s)]
*  And that's actually something [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=632.62s)]
*  that Elizabeth Warren talks [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=633.76s)]
*  about. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=634.72s)]
*  I'm not sure that her specifics [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  reach it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=636.62s)]
*  But we've got an economy [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=637.16s)]
*  increasingly concentrated in [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  this country, big business [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  increasingly building moats [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=642.48s)]
*  around. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=643.84s)]
*  We need to kind of have a renewed [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=644.2800000000001s)]
*  focus on competition. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=646.38s)]
*  So that's antitrust. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=647.38s)]
*  Yeah, a 21st century antitrust [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  policy, a kind of pragmatic [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=650.52s)]
*  approach to immigration, which [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=653.32s)]
*  is not complete open borders, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=655.4200000000001s)]
*  but not draw a bridge up. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=658.12s)]
*  There needs to be, I think, as we [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=659.5600000000001s)]
*  look forward, the underlying [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  demographics of many countries [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=663.24s)]

*  immigration. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=666.64s)]
*  But we need to find ways to make [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=667.24s)]
*  that immigration politically [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=668.7s)]
*  sustainable. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=670.58s)]
*  It means, I think, in a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=671.6999999999999s)]
*  geopolitical sense, the U.S. and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=673.06s)]

*  do? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=767.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the West [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=768.14s)]
*  needs to stand up for what it [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=769.4s)]
*  believes in. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=770.54s)]
*  And I think, therefore, it's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=771.24s)]
*  important to call out human [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=772.58s)]
*  rights abuses. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=774.44s)]
*  It's important to stand up for, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=775.14s)]
*  you know, Western ideals, even [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=777.38s)]
*  if China is an enormous market. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=779.02s)]
*  And so I think that there is, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=781.58s)]
*  you know, clearly one area of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  increasing tension is that China [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=785.82s)]
*  now increasingly doesn't not only [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  won't countenance criticism of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=790.42s)]
*  what it does internally, it wants [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=792.52s)]
*  no criticism in the rest of the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  world of what it does internally. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=796.56s)]
*  And I think that is a fault line [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=798.06s)]
*  and it's one where the West needs [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=800.14s)]
*  to stand up for what it believes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=801.16s)]
*  How does the economists deal with [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  China and have to work through its [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=803.9s)]

*  And they're always clever, maybe [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=823.7199999999999s)]
*  even as the British would say, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=825.38s)]
*  too clever by half. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=827.02s)]
*  It takes you a moment to figure [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=828.42s)]
*  them out. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=829.9599999999999s)]
*  One of the covers that was most [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=831.12s)]
*  striking this year was your [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=832.56s)]
*  special issue on climate change. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=833.6999999999999s)]
*  Describe that cover and that [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=836.2199999999999s)]
*  special issue. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=838.42s)]
*  What was driving you? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=839.26s)]
*  So we decided it was the first [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=840.14s)]
*  time we've ever done a special [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=841.4s)]
*  issue where we had in every [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=843.26s)]
*  section of the newspaper, we call [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=845.38s)]
*  it a newspaper, in every section [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=847.0s)]

*  about climate change and we had a [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=849.98s)]
*  big we had an editorial, we had a [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=851.6800000000001s)]
*  big explanatory briefing and it [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=853.48s)]
*  was we had a special logo. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=856.02s)]
*  The reason we did that was to [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=857.58s)]
*  show that every aspect of our [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=858.96s)]
*  world, so every aspect of what we [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=861.58s)]
*  cover will be influenced by [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=863.22s)]
*  climate change. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=864.76s)]

*  that we wrote about. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=867.36s)]
*  There were other things, but it [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=867.96s)]
*  was through infused throughout [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=868.76s)]
*  throughout the economists that [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=870.36s)]

*  colleague of mine who suggested [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=874.3000000000001s)]
*  the idea, was a very bold graphic [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=875.52s)]

*  temperature had risen. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=883.6s)]
*  So it was the temperature of the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=885.0s)]
*  world relative to an average [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=886.14s)]

*  the past 150 years. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=893.14s)]
*  And it it it showed because it [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=895.18s)]
*  was basically blue, blue, blue, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=897.04s)]

*  had gone on with with global [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=902.58s)]
*  temperature. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=904.12s)]

*  subject. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=915.54s)]

*  But that dealing with it, which [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  requires a profound shift from [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  energy, carbon energy that comes [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=941.2199999999999s)]
*  from carbon to energy that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=943.06s)]

*  the only way we will do that is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=947.8199999999999s)]
*  by harnessing the innovative [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=949.06s)]
*  power of capitalism to do it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=950.5s)]
*  And part of the my frustration [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=952.26s)]
*  with the current climate debate [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=953.8s)]

*  those people who are more focused [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=957.54s)]
*  on what's happening with the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=959.18s)]

*  led to this. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=966.14s)]
*  And I think that that is at some [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=967.4s)]
*  point a kind of dead end of a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=969.0s)]

*  The only way we're going to as a [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=971.58s)]
*  planet address climate change. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=975.02s)]
*  And if we don't, to be clear, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=977.22s)]
*  it's not necessarily it's not [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=979.62s)]
*  going to be existential for the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=981.32s)]

*  affect hundreds of millions of [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=983.66s)]
*  people as the earth warms and as [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=985.52s)]
*  we see the the ever more frequent [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=988.0s)]
*  extreme weather events. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=991.22s)]
*  But to counter that, you have to [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=993.22s)]
*  harness the innovative power of [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=995.4200000000001s)]
*  capitalism. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=996.82s)]
*  You have to you have to have all [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=997.4200000000001s)]

*  economist stands for of free [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1001.26s)]
*  markets, harness to help do that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1003.26s)]
*  And we can do that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1005.74s)]
*  So it was not an advocacy issue. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1006.84s)]
*  It was an explanatory issue. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1009.3000000000001s)]
*  And the whole tone of it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1010.7800000000001s)]
*  And if it wasn't this, then then [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1012.34s)]
*  then we failed. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1014.48s)]
*  Our goal was very much to to kind [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1015.5200000000001s)]
*  of lay out the comprehensive [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1017.88s)]

*  do so in a kind of fact based [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxQvQ1ZVT1g&t=1022.24s)]
