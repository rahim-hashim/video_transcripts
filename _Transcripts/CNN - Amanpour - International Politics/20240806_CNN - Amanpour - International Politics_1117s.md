# “At the Edge of Empire:” Communist Idealism, Disillusionment & Leaving China | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw)
*  Well, as market jitters in the U.S., the shock waves are being closely watched in China, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=0.0s)]

*  of the world's second-largest economy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=9.88s)]
*  China's economic leadership has been built atop decades of communist authoritarian rule, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=12.6s)]
*  and few people have experienced this transformation as closely and personally as author Edward [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=17.16s)]
*  Wong. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=22.16s)]
*  In his book, At the Edge of Empire, he chronicles how his family and the nation grappled with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=23.16s)]
*  the political evolution that paved China's path to global ascendance. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=27.64s)]
*  He joined Walter Isaacson to discuss his latest work. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=32.04s)]
*  Edward Wong, welcome to the show. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=35.44s)]
*  Great to see you again, Walter. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=37.72s)]
*  I want to read a sentence from near the beginning of your new book. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=38.72s)]
*  And you say, when I was in my twenties, father showed me a small black and white photograph [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=42.36s)]
*  of himself that I'd never seen before. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=47.8s)]
*  He placed it in my hand as we sat together in the living room of my childhood home outside [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=50.2s)]
*  of Washington, D.C. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=56.12s)]
*  It had been taken in China in 1953. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=57.12s)]
*  His eyes glimmered and skin had none of the lines of age. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  He wore a plain military uniform and a cap. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=64.36s)]
*  I ran a finger over a darkened spot in the center of the shadow there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=67.0s)]
*  Father said that's where the red star had been, a symbol of the People's Liberation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=73.56s)]
*  Army. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  This starts you on this journey, finding out about your family and how it's interwoven [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  with Chinese history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=85.32s)]
*  Tell me how that propelled you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, when I was in my twenties, I started getting much more interested in China. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=88.88s)]
*  I went to study Mandarin in Beijing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  I took courses in Chinese history and politics in grad school. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=96.08s)]
*  And so I thought at the time, I learned a little bit more about what my parents had [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=99.88s)]
*  been up to during these great years of upheaval on their Mao's regime. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=104.08s)]
*  I learned that my mother fled China at a fairly early age because they were landowners. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=109.6s)]
*  The communists persecuted them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  My father had a much more complicated history and he started telling me a bit of that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=115.84s)]
*  He told me about how he had served in the army and he eventually fled to Hong Kong. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=119.84s)]
*  Now, I knew some of the general contours of that, but it wasn't until after I finished [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=124.88s)]
*  a long tour in China for the New York Times, I was there from 2008 until the end of 2016 [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  and then moved back to Washington, that I really started probing deeper into his story [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=134.56s)]
*  because it was only after living in China and going to many of the places where my parents [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=139.88s)]
*  had lived, where my father has served in the army in the northeast of Manchuria, in the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=145.0s)]
*  northwest, in Xinjiang, that I could understand the context for the questions that I wanted [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=149.76s)]
*  to ask him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=155.76s)]
*  And so I probe deeper into how and why he had joined the army and also what he did out [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=156.76s)]
*  there as part of this military occupation of Xinjiang that Mao ordered from the very [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=163.4s)]
*  beginning of communist rule. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=168.44s)]
*  You talk about your father and his brother, and his subtitle is A Family's Reckoning with [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=170.12s)]
*  China. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=175.68s)]
*  Your father's brother, Sam, goes the other way, leaves China. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=176.68s)]
*  Why was that and how's that reflected? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=182.12s)]
*  They're both still alive today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=184.32s)]
*  How's that reflected in their outlook? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=188.12s)]
*  Sam got a scholarship when he graduated from high school, right before the Chinese Civil [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=189.12s)]
*  War ended, Walter, right before 1949 when the Congress took over. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=194.64s)]
*  And he decided to go back to Hong Kong, where he had been born and then go from there to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=198.0s)]
*  America. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=202.04s)]
*  He part of the irony of the story, of course, is that he eventually becomes an engineer [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=203.04s)]
*  for the U.S. military, first in the army and then for decades in the Navy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  Whereas my father went in the opposite direction. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=213.84s)]
*  He graduated from high school in southern China a few years after Sam. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=216.0s)]
*  And instead of going to Hong Kong, where he had been born and forced to leave during the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=220.84s)]
*  Japanese occupation, he decided to go to Beijing instead. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  And the reason for that is because he had become enamored of the communist revolution. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  He thought that Mao was authentic in wanting to bring change to China and wanting to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  transform China and put it on par with Britain and with America at the time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=239.96s)]
*  And he thought that the communists could unite China and make it strong while the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=244.56s)]
*  nationalists had failed because of corruption in their government, because of their [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=249.64s)]
*  mismanagement, because of their poor economic policies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=254.88s)]
*  So my father really believed that he could help build China into a stronger nation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's when he went to Beijing, took part in a military parade, also a parade of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  students and workers in front of Mao in Tiananmen Square in 1950. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=266.96s)]
*  And then very shortly afterwards, signed up to join the new Air Force in order to fight [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=271.36s)]
*  the Americans on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=276.4s)]
*  But they send them off to Shenzhen province up Kashgar. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=278.4s)]
*  I remember being in Kashgar once and they used the great Chinese phrase, the heaven is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  high and the emperor is far away. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=288.84s)]
*  In other words, they're not there on the edge of empire. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=290.76s)]
*  And of course, that's what your book's title is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  What is it about China that has all these edges of empire, including where your father [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=296.64s)]
*  was sent? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, one of the themes I wanted to really bring out in the book was that in a way, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  China is defined by these frontier regions and are not really frontiers when you think [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=306.44s)]
*  about it. The areas of Xinjiang, the Tibetan areas, they make up a third of China. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=311.28s)]
*  And when you think about it, China really is the last of the big Eurasian empires to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=316.2s)]
*  survive. The British, the Ottomans, the Russians, they all fell apart because of the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=322.4s)]
*  World Wars. China, on the other hand, was able to reconstitute itself as an empire [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=327.44s)]
*  under the communists when Mao took over and then when he sent troops into Xinjiang, into [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=333.04s)]
*  Tibet to occupy those regions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=338.68s)]
*  My father was in the vanguard of those troops being sent out in the early 50s. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=340.92s)]
*  He became part of that military occupation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=345.72s)]
*  And in my assessment of this, much of the rule of the Communist Party is defined by [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  this idea that they have to hold on to the empire. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  They have to make sure that doesn't fall apart. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  One of the main narrative tracks of the book is contemporary China from 2008 onward and the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=360.56s)]
*  rule of Xi Jinping and how that's changed under him. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=366.64s)]
*  And I say in the book that one of Xi's big fears is what happens to Soviet Union. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=369.76s)]
*  And he talked about that privately with President Biden in a dinner in 2011 in China. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=375.68s)]
*  He's talked about that in private speeches with Communist Party officials. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=381.24s)]
*  I dug all that out for the book. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  And when he talks about that, he has in his head this idea of the Soviet territories like [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  the Central Asian territories really leaving the empire. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=393.88s)]
*  And I think he has a great fear of that in China. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  And so the increasing use of force and paranoia and the idea of China as a state that must [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  maintain internal security is ever present for Xi because of this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=405.84s)]
*  You talk about your father marching through Tiananmen Square with the troops being reviewed [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=410.32s)]
*  by Mao Zedong. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  And then, of course, when you go to China as a diplomat, as a correspondent for The New [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=416.4s)]
*  York Times, you're there. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=420.28s)]
*  You see the same thing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  You watch the troops. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=423.88s)]
*  Did you harken back to your father's experience and you use in the book a wonderful phrase [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=425.68s)]
*  about a Mobius strip of your family's history and China's intertwining? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=430.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that really struck me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=436.44s)]
*  I've seen a military parade twice now in Tiananmen Square with Xi presiding over it [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=438.48s)]
*  both times. And of course, you're struck by the physicality of it, Walter. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=443.48s)]
*  You see these long lines of troops of all the armored vehicles, of even the ballistic [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=447.96s)]
*  missiles that they roll out. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=454.24s)]
*  My father obviously saw something on a smaller scale. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=456.12s)]
*  But I did feel that there is a certain echo of history here. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=459.8s)]
*  I really felt when I stood there, oh, my father must have been just a few yards or a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=465.28s)]
*  few hundred yards away from me and actually in the parade marching in front of Mao, just [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=470.64s)]
*  like these troops are doing, wanting to see some sort of sign of approval from the great [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=475.0s)]
*  leader, all acting out of patriotism or nationalism. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=481.08s)]
*  And I really felt that sense there in Tiananmen Square. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  So I feel like a lot of the feelings of China becoming a stronger nation, of the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=488.44s)]
*  nationalism that courses through many Chinese citizens and through the city of Beijing [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=494.24s)]
*  today, it has their foundations earlier, much earlier in the Mao era. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=500.64s)]
*  So you think there's a direct line from Mao to Xi Jinping? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=506.36s)]
*  I do think that. I think Xi himself sees that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=510.2s)]
*  I think he he has proclaimed himself a core leader, just like Mao and Deng Xiaoping [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=512.76s)]
*  were considered core leaders. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=518.12s)]
*  And he sees himself as a guardian of the legacy of the Communist Revolution and of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=520.24s)]
*  the party's power. I think he sees that more sharply than some of his predecessors. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=526.28s)]
*  He comes from Red Royalty. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=531.4s)]
*  He's a princeling. His father was one of Mao's compatriots and was a senior leader in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=535.08s)]
*  the Communist Party, even though for a certain period he was persecuted by Mao. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=539.64s)]
*  And I think Xi sees himself as a guarantor of all that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=543.5600000000001s)]
*  So your father wants to join the Communist Party. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=546.92s)]
*  He's excited when it seems like a possibility. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  He's been part of the People's Liberation Army, and yet he doesn't get selected to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=554.16s)]
*  join the Communist Party. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's a hinge in the book where he sort of gets disillusioned. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=562.3599999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  The roots go back to when he was in Manchuria hoping to go with the Air Force into [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  Korea to fight the Americans. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=572.52s)]
*  And instead, he gets sent to Xinjiang, as he pointed out. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=573.76s)]
*  And he suspected something was up at that time. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=576.44s)]
*  He suspected he was being sent into exile. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=578.76s)]
*  Then in Xinjiang, over six years or so, he wins the confidence of military commanders. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=581.0s)]
*  He gets a chance to go back into interior China to study engineering. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=586.0s)]
*  He wants to build military aircraft for the country. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=589.72s)]
*  And he's got a pending application to be a party member. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=593.76s)]
*  Some senior officials in Xinjiang have recommended that he be allowed to join the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=597.52s)]
*  party, and he has high hopes for doing that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=602.92s)]
*  Then he discovers through conversations with other officials that they still don't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=605.72s)]
*  trust him. He has something in his background dossier, and he realizes it's because [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=610.72s)]
*  he comes from a merchant family that lived in Hong Kong. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=617.84s)]
*  He was born there in the British colony and his brother, as you know, had gone to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=620.92s)]
*  America to study there. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=624.64s)]
*  And so the communist suspected this about his background. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=626.08s)]
*  At the time in Maoist China, there was hunts for subversives. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=630.7199999999999s)]
*  There were campaigns against counterrevolutionaries. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=636.16s)]
*  He never knew who might be cast under this shadow of suspicion. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=638.88s)]
*  And so my father realized there's something structurally wrong with that, with the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=644.8s)]
*  party, that someone like himself who had made all these sacrifices for the party and [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=649.0s)]
*  for the army could not be trusted. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=654.76s)]
*  And I think he realized that because of this dynamic of power and of fear and [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=656.5999999999999s)]
*  suspicion that he would never be trusted. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  He also experienced the great famine that happened when Mao instituted his [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=665.5999999999999s)]
*  disastrous economic policies under the Great Leap Forward. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=671.04s)]
*  Thirty to forty million Chinese died during that period. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=674.2399999999999s)]
*  My father fell ill, as did his classmates. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=677.16s)]
*  And those, along with a few other factors like Mao's purges of military commanders, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  then spurred him to make a flight to Hong Kong. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=685.76s)]
*  He realized he had no future in China, that China was heading in the wrong direction [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=688.48s)]
*  at the time. Mao had kept his grip on power for too long and he needed to get out of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=692.64s)]
*  the country. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=697.88s)]
*  Partway through the book, Reinhold Niebuhr, the Protestant theologian, sort of pops [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=699.04s)]
*  into your mind, I think. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=705.44s)]
*  And you do a reflection on how Niebuhr looked at America's perception of its own [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=707.04s)]
*  innocence. And you also say that struck you about China as well. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=712.48s)]
*  Explain that to me. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=717.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are a lot of parallels between America and China. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=718.7600000000001s)]
*  I think this is one thing that many Americans miss, even ones who analysts in [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=721.4000000000001s)]
*  Washington, for example. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think that both countries see themselves as great powers. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=726.6s)]
*  And I don't mean just the leaders. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=731.6s)]
*  I mean the leaders and the citizens. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  They see themselves as powers that have something to give to the world and that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  the world should accept that and appreciate it as well. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=741.88s)]
*  And I think Americans feel strongly that way. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=746.36s)]
*  They America, as you know, has a certain missionary zeal in its foreign policy. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=748.52s)]
*  It wants to spread democracy in the world. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=755.5600000000001s)]
*  We see that as recently as Biden, who's framed his foreign policy as democracy [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=758.08s)]
*  versus autocracy. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=762.24s)]
*  They say they don't want regime change in other countries. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=763.28s)]
*  But at the same time, when you look at all the rhetoric that comes out of American [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=765.96s)]
*  leaders and policymakers, they would prefer it if other countries adopted [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=770.56s)]
*  democratic systems and certain norms. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=775.64s)]
*  I think China, China isn't trying to impose its exact political system on other [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=779.0s)]
*  countries, but it would like other countries to accept certain things that China [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  is giving it. I think China believes its economic system might be better than that [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=788.92s)]
*  of many other countries, including the United States. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=794.92s)]
*  I think it feels that if other countries adopted its vision of economic performance, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=797.5600000000001s)]
*  of trade and to a certain degree of politics, then those countries would benefit. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=802.7600000000001s)]
*  And I think neither country sees the negative consequences that could result from [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  trying to persuade or impose these policies on other nations. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=814.96s)]
*  What does China feel its leadership and maybe even its people about the possibility [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=822.12s)]
*  of Donald Trump being president again? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=827.48s)]
*  That's a complicated question. I don't I'm not in the heads of the leaders, but I [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=829.8s)]
*  have spoken to some Chinese scholars and analysts who are close to the party and [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=834.16s)]
*  close to some decision makers. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=838.28s)]
*  They say that that there is a feeling that Trump being head of the United States [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=840.8s)]
*  will be better for China's interests in the long term. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=850.72s)]
*  And they say this because when you look at what Biden has done, they see that Biden [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  has strengthened the military alliances of the U.S. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=860.24s)]
*  around Asia. They feel that there's a policy of containment now that Biden has [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  been pushing. And they and also Biden kept the tariffs that Trump imposed on China in [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=867.64s)]
*  place while also starting a new policy of trying to restrict very sensitive, high [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=874.76s)]
*  tech components to China, semiconductors, advanced semiconductor tooling equipment, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=881.04s)]
*  things that all countries need in order to make the next great technological leap. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=886.08s)]
*  And so China sees this policy of what they call containment as much more cohesive in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=891.52s)]
*  the Biden administration than was under Trump. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=897.2s)]
*  Now, they had no love for what Trump did. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=899.12s)]
*  Trump, of course, imposed tariffs, started this trade war, and there was much anxiety [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=901.76s)]
*  about that. But I think they see that as a lesser problem than the more holistic [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=908.36s)]
*  policy that Biden has started. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=913.28s)]
*  And they also think that Trump cannot strengthen America's alliances in the same way [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=916.24s)]
*  that Biden has done. In fact, if anything, they think that Trump erodes America's [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=921.92s)]
*  alliances and sows distrust among American allies in the U.S. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=926.44s)]
*  And I think they feel that that benefits them in the long run. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=932.04s)]
*  Xi Jinping has embraced a nationalism and an authoritarianism in order to rule China [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=935.24s)]
*  with more power. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=943.9599999999999s)]
*  But we've also seen that around the world. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=945.88s)]
*  This seems to be a trend, whether it's Putin or Orban or many others. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=947.76s)]
*  We even see that a bit in the United States. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=951.8399999999999s)]
*  To what extent do you think this is a trend and what do the Chinese think about that? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=955.12s)]
*  I do think that there is momentum right now in the world for a rethinking of democracy [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=960.1999999999999s)]
*  and of whether authoritarianism is the way to go for many of these countries. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=970.28s)]
*  I mean, it goes back and forth. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=974.36s)]
*  Walter, we've seen, for example, some setbacks to the far right in recent elections in [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=975.92s)]
*  Europe. But I also think that in the U.S. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=981.12s)]
*  We're now grappling with this idea of whether certain authoritarian ways of governing [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=984.32s)]
*  might be better than messy democracy. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=991.84s)]
*  And I think you see this not just in the in the push and pull between the Republicans [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=994.6s)]
*  and the Democrats, but if you look at polling among millennials, you see a lot of them, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  say, for example, democracy isn't necessarily that important to the governance of the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  United States. I think a large part of it is an erosion of our memories from the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1008.0s)]
*  mid 20th century, Walter, that there's a as the older generations fade away, younger [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1014.72s)]
*  people forget the wars that were fought in the 20th century and of the rise of [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1020.9200000000001s)]

*  some people because of the economic boom that the Communist Party has managed to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1031.72s)]

*  And the fact that the party oftentimes in recent decades has seemed adaptable. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1038.36s)]
*  We have to admit that that it has been able to pick and choose policies and put in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1044.0s)]

*  repressive security state in many parts of China, especially in the Western regions, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1054.44s)]
*  as we talked about. And and one example is the recent zero covid policy that she [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1060.12s)]
*  adopted. It was very strict. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB0SMyvbxXw&t=1066.28s)]
