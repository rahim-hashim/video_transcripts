Video Description: Over 300 foreign correspondents who have worked in Russia are demanding the immediate release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. In a letter to the Russian government, the group condemned Russia’s accusations of espionage and called the arrest a “disturbing and dangerous signal” against honest journalism.

*  In a letter to the Russian government, they condemned Russia's accusations of espionage [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=10.24s)]
*  and said that the arrest is quote, a disturbing and dangerous signal against honest journalism. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  At the UN Security Council today, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield also called [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=20.32s)]
*  out Russia for their violation of human rights and detention of American citizens. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=24.94s)]
*  And right now Evan Gishkovich is being wrongfully detained by the Russian government simply [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=30.26s)]
*  for doing his job as a respected journalist. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=36.34s)]

*  Walter Isaacson. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=44.6s)]
*  Thank you, Beata and Anton Trinovsky. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=45.6s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=48.86s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=50.66s)]
*  Your friend, colleague, sometimes competitor, Evan Gishkovich was detained, the Wall Street [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=52.26s)]
*  Journal reporter in Russia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=58.9s)]
*  Before we get into the charges that they put against him, tell me a little about him as [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  a person. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=66.46s)]
*  Well, he's a brilliant journalist, a great friend. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=67.46s)]
*  You pointed out that he's a competitor, which is strictly speaking true. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=71.66s)]
*  He was working for the Wall Street Journal in Moscow. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=75.9s)]
*  I was with the New York Times. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=78.1s)]
*  But just an incredibly supportive colleague, you know, someone who would always reach out [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=81.22s)]
*  when you had a good story, someone who was never shy about sharing contacts or ideas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  You know, he was really one of those correspondents when you're working in a place like Moscow [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  where it can be tough to report. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  You really need journalists to support each other. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=101.61999999999999s)]
*  And that's what he was doing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  You tell the story about some salmon roe that he brought you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=107.46s)]
*  It kind of humanized him when I was reading them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=112.38s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=113.38s)]
*  Well, we, so I've been based in Berlin since last year. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=115.13999999999999s)]
*  And because he had to leave Moscow, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=121.13999999999999s)]
*  After the exactly, exactly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=124.58s)]
*  And so I've been based in Berlin. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=127.1s)]
*  He was visiting Berlin and he for New Year's came to my house and brought some salmon roe, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=128.6s)]
*  which they call red caviar in Russia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=136.66s)]
*  It's kind of a traditional Russian food for New Year's. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=138.62s)]
*  And that was, you know, that's how I really think about him now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=142.02s)]
*  Someone who kind of was always very sharing and someone who really cared about Russia, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=147.9s)]
*  which is a country where he grew up. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=154.46s)]
*  His parents are Soviet emigres. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  He grew up in New Jersey, speaking Russian at home. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=160.26s)]
*  And he was really interested and excited about being in Russia and getting to know [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=164.6s)]
*  the country, getting to know its traditions. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, you and he share that in a way coming from families that are Soviet or Russian emigrate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=172.84s)]
*  families. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=178.28s)]
*  How does that give you an insight into the Russian soul? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=179.28s)]
*  And what do you feel personally, both you and Evan, as you see what's happening now? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=181.2s)]
*  Oh, it's really, really tough, frankly. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  It's true. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=189.32s)]
*  I'm also from a Russian immigrant family to the United States and worked in Russia from [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=190.32s)]
*  2018 as a journalist. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=197.92s)]
*  It's, you know, you can never, certainly never have full insight into the Russian soul. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=200.76s)]
*  But we did feel, I think both Evan and I, a special connection to the place, really [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=208.2s)]
*  responsibility to tell people as best we could about what was going on in Russia with its [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=216.02s)]
*  nuances, with its complexities. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=223.18s)]
*  And that's something that you saw Evan do. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=225.34s)]
*  You know, he bravely continued to report from Russia after the war began. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=227.86s)]
*  And he just really felt a special responsibility, a special duty as one of the few journalists, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  American journalists working there at the time to really tell people about what was [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=241.3s)]
*  going on, speak to everyone he could, you know, both pro-war and anti-war and try to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=246.46s)]
*  explain to the world what was happening in Russia at this time. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=253.34s)]
*  The Russians say he was arrested for espionage. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=258.46000000000004s)]
*  West says he's unlawfully detained. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=261.86s)]
*  Why do you think the Russian authorities did arrest him? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so the charges are espionage, which are absurd. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=268.5s)]
*  This is a journalist who was doing his job. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=272.62s)]
*  I think this is really part of this overall escalation that you're seeing in Putin's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=276.78s)]
*  conflict with the West, his conflict with the United States in particular. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=284.26s)]
*  You know, we've had this crackdown on the free press in Russia for years now under Vladimir [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=290.34s)]
*  Putin. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=298.1s)]
*  For most of that time, it really mainly affected the Russian press, Russian journalists who [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  were jailed, exiled, in some cases even killed in the country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=306.42s)]
*  Now it's come, this crackdown has come to affect Western journalists. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=313.98s)]
*  I think the fact that Evan has an American passport made him more of a target. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  We've seen Russia practicing essentially hostage-taking with American citizens as happened with [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=324.54s)]
*  Putin and Greiner. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=331.82s)]
*  Do you think that he might be a hostage in a way? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=332.82s)]
*  That he's been taken so that he could be traded for somebody else? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=334.98s)]
*  I believe that that unfortunately is how you have to look at it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=339.82000000000005s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=345.54s)]
*  The Russians still have prisoners, people who are in prison in Western countries that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=348.3s)]
*  they apparently want back. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=356.94s)]
*  We don't know for certain that this is the case here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=358.5s)]
*  You know, at this point we can only speculate, though there have been Russian officials who [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  have already been speculating about a prisoner exchange after Evan is convicted, which is [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=366.54s)]
*  something in the very Kremlin controlled judicial system in Russia that unfortunately [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=373.78s)]
*  we can expect to happen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=381.17999999999995s)]
*  But it's also part, as I said, of this overall escalation of Putin's conflict with the West, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=383.9s)]
*  sort of yet another way to show the West that Putin is ready to take actions that would [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=390.61999999999995s)]
*  escalate this overall conflict. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=397.82s)]
*  Isn't this really the first time a Western journalist since the Cold War has been arrested [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=399.98s)]
*  in Russia? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=406.38s)]
*  And does that signal some new phase of this? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=407.58s)]
*  Yes, I think it does. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=411.1s)]
*  The last time that a Western journalist was arrested for espionage was not even in Russia, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=413.18s)]
*  it was in the Soviet Union in the 1980s. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=419.62s)]
*  And that was a case that took only a few weeks to play out until that correspondent, McDonnell, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=423.06s)]
*  was freed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=429.46s)]
*  In this case, again, it's already taken longer. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=431.21999999999997s)]
*  It's already been close to a month that Evan has been detained. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=435.18s)]
*  And it is, it's a new phase. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=440.18s)]
*  It's this very unpredictable phase, frankly, of the conflict, because this is one of those [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=442.29999999999995s)]
*  things that would have been really, really hard to imagine not long ago. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  You've written about an outburst of solidarity, I think you called it, among at least some [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=453.82s)]
*  segments of the Russian population in favor of Evan and perhaps in resistance to what's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=458.72s)]
*  happening in Russia. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=464.12s)]
*  To what extent is that happening now, some pushback against what the Russian leaders [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=465.44s)]
*  are doing? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=470.8s)]
*  Oh, well, overall, there is still pushback inside the country. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=471.8s)]
*  Thousands of people have been arrested for speaking out against the war. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  And this is Russia has become a country where you can get a year's long prison term for [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=485.64s)]
*  so much as criticizing the war and the Russian president on social media. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=492.56s)]
*  So there is still that kind of pushback happening. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=499.0s)]
*  It's just being repressed in an incredibly aggressive way. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=503.44s)]
*  As for Evan, yeah, I've been really moved by the outburst of solidarity from Russian [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=508.64s)]
*  journalists, most of whom are actually now in exile outside the country, because, you [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=513.68s)]
*  know, it was for a number of years, it was Evan and the rest of us in the Western press [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=521.8s)]
*  corps who were writing about the crackdown on Russian journalists and trying to kind [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=527.5999999999999s)]
*  of give voice to their plight. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=534.76s)]
*  And now those roles have been reversed. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=536.4799999999999s)]
*  It's Russian journalists who are helping Western journalists try to figure out how to help [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=539.4s)]
*  Evan. You know, in that article I wrote about how I was trying to send him a letter using [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=545.08s)]
*  this online letter writing service for Russian prisons. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=550.12s)]
*  And the person who helped me was actually the fiance of a Russian journalist who's in [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=554.48s)]
*  prison right now and has been since 2020. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=559.72s)]
*  She showed me how to how to use that service. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=563.6s)]
*  So that just as a one tiny example of this great outburst of solidarity we're seeing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  now. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=572.08s)]
*  Do you think that the Russian people are generally supportive of this reaction against the West? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=572.88s)]
*  Or is there some sentiment amongst the Russian people that they are better off being closer [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=579.52s)]
*  to the West? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=586.0s)]
*  That has really fluctuated that that sentiment. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=587.84s)]
*  Obviously, there was a lot of pro-Western sentiment 30 years ago when the Soviet Union [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=591.52s)]
*  was collapsing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=600.28s)]
*  Now there's a lot less of that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=601.88s)]
*  I think a really big reason is the propaganda. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=604.96s)]
*  If you think about it, if you turn on the TV in Russia, no matter what channel, it's [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  going to be a pro-Kremlin channel where you will have hours of talk shows and newscasts [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=612.16s)]
*  every day telling you about why the West is evil, why the West, led by America, wants [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=618.88s)]
*  to destroy Russia and how Putin has, as Russian propaganda says, brought Russia up from its [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  knees and made it an independent, sovereign, powerful actor again on the world stage. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=630.76s)]
*  So there are many people who believe that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=637.0s)]
*  There are also people, as I was saying earlier, who despite this repression are still trying [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=639.52s)]
*  to speak out, say, to their fellow Russians that what's happening now is wrong. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=646.8s)]
*  But there's also a big set, I think, of the population that just sees that there's nothing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=654.12s)]
*  really they can do about this situation. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=661.8s)]
*  The fact that Putin appears to be firmly in power, there aren't any political groups that [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  we can see that could challenge him in the near term. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=673.56s)]
*  So when people see there's nothing really they can change about a situation, I think [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=679.1199999999999s)]
*  they also look for ways to kind of rationalize it in their mind or pay as little attention [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=683.9599999999999s)]
*  as possible. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=690.3599999999999s)]
*  And I think you've got a big group of Russians inside the country who feel that way. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=691.7199999999999s)]
*  Russian opposition leader Vladimir Karamurtza was sentenced to 25 years in prison this past [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=697.6s)]
*  week for opposing the Ukraine war, for treason. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=704.4s)]
*  He was actually on his way to be on this show when he got arrested. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=707.96s)]
*  Tell me about that sentence. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=714.24s)]
*  Is it unusually harsh? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=715.96s)]
*  And what does it signal? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=718.0400000000001s)]
*  That's an incredibly harsh sentence, even by Russian standards. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=720.32s)]
*  Even people who are convicted of murder typically get a shorter sentence than 25 years in Russia. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=724.5999999999999s)]
*  So it tells us that, again, this escalation in repression is continuing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=733.12s)]
*  Another key thing to point out here, as you said, is he was convicted of treason. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  The treasonous actions that he took in the narrative of the government are that he spoke [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  out against the war and against Vladimir Putin. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=754.24s)]
*  And so that tells you that now speaking out against the leadership of Russia can be tantamount [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  to treason. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=767.0s)]
*  And this comes as both Putin and others in the Russian leadership are referring to people [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=768.4s)]
*  who are against the war who are pro-Western as potential traitors. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=775.68s)]
*  And that just tells you how incredibly repressive the environment is inside Russia and the fact [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=780.64s)]
*  that when it comes to these kinds of repressive actions, we frankly can only expect them to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=786.88s)]
*  get more and more intense. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=795.4399999999999s)]
*  A year ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine, there was a big deal in the United States [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=797.64s)]
*  and the West about putting on crushing sanctions, we said. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=802.88s)]
*  We said it was going to bring the Russian economy down, especially hurt the oligarchs. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=806.48s)]
*  And yet your reporting shows that hasn't happened. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=811.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=814.48s)]
*  Well, look, the sanctions have certainly affected Russia's economy. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=815.48s)]
*  They have led to some decline in the country's economic output. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=821.84s)]
*  But it's been limited. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=827.64s)]
*  The government has found ways to really reduce the impact of those sanctions. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=831.66s)]
*  So Western cars are no longer being officially imported into Russia. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=838.46s)]
*  But there are all kinds of parallel export schemes, as they call them, that allow cars [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=845.74s)]
*  and other Western consumer goods to be imported into Russia through other countries that aren't [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=853.42s)]
*  part of the sanctions. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=859.5s)]
*  Chinese car manufacturers have become huge in Russia and other Chinese consumer electronics. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=861.74s)]
*  So Western companies like Starbucks and McDonald's and IKEA have left the country. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=869.18s)]
*  But there are local alternatives that have been popping up. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=875.26s)]
*  And at the same time, the overall economy continues to keep going. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=879.06s)]
*  There is not mass unemployment or... [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=886.58s)]
*  How do we miscalculate the sanctions so badly then? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=891.34s)]
*  Well, I think these sanctions were incredibly aggressive. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=895.0600000000001s)]
*  They were more intense than we've seen pretty much any sanctions. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=900.5s)]
*  But the Russian economy is not doing much worse than other economies at the moment. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=904.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think what we've seen is the success of the Russian government's planning for [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  this kind of thing. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=916.94s)]
*  We've been talking for a number of years that Putin has been working on sanctions-proofing [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=918.58s)]
*  his economy, piling up reserves through the country's central bank. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=926.22s)]
*  But you say he's even getting hard technology. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=932.9000000000001s)]
*  We were supposed to stop some of the technology, some of the chips, but even those are getting in, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=936.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=941.3s)]
*  I mean, because there are many countries around the world that are not participating in the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=942.3s)]
*  sanctions like China, like India, like all of the Central Asian countries that border [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=948.6999999999999s)]
*  Russia to the south in Asia. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=955.18s)]
*  So there are still many places that Putin can turn to around the world as economic partners. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=958.78s)]
*  And at the same time, his economy really functions in a way that it's just not as susceptible [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=967.9399999999999s)]
*  to Western sanctions as it would have been just five, ten years ago. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=973.98s)]
*  You've been writing a lot about the leaks of national security documents from the United [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=979.66s)]
*  States. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=984.9s)]
*  First of all, tell me what those leaks tell us about what's happening inside the Kremlin. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=986.18s)]
*  Well, there was one document in particular that pointed to some competition between the [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=991.6999999999999s)]
*  FSB, which is the Domestic Intelligence Agency that used to be called the KGB in Soviet days, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1000.5s)]
*  and the Russian military. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1007.14s)]
*  According to one of those documents, it looks like the FSB is saying that internally the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1010.14s)]
*  Russian military is saying there are fewer casualties of the war on the Russian side [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1013.98s)]
*  than there really are. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1021.58s)]
*  At the same time, we did not see much in those documents that would show that the United [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1023.26s)]
*  States has direct knowledge of what's happening inside Putin's inner circle. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1030.52s)]
*  Obviously, those documents are a very small, tiny subset of what American intelligence [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1035.5s)]
*  agencies know, but we are not seeing much evidence that the U.S. has that deep insight [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1041.5s)]
*  into the Kremlin that a lot of people are looking for. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1051.82s)]
*  Anton Troninowski, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1057.26s)]
*  Thank you, Walter. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gANiirjz7e4&t=1061.02s)]
