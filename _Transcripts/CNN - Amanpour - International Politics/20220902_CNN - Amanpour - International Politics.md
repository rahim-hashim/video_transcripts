*  To discuss why Afghan women should be involved in setting policy for their country, Nahid [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=24.12s)]
*  speaks to Hari Sreenivasan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=28.36s)]
*  Thanks, Nahid Shalhalimi. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=31.8s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=32.96s)]
*  Now, we're having this conversation about a year after those images that are now seared [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  into our heads of the last flights leaving Afghanistan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=39.8s)]
*  Since then, there's been basically an economic collapse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=43.36s)]
*  What are the consequences of that for families and people living there today from the people [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  that you speak to? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=51.52s)]
*  Well, I would add drought. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=52.56s)]
*  I would add illness. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=54.28s)]
*  I would add many, many other things on top of what you just said. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=55.44s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=60.68s)]
*  We have millions of people that are not only devastated, but they're on the brink of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=61.4s)]
*  starvation and in a system that is that is almost collapsed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=66.12s)]
*  It's collapsing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=70.88s)]
*  And again, you know, almost 50 years of these regime changes have also had this enormous [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=72.36s)]
*  traumatic residues that we will see in the next generations to come. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=81.84s)]
*  And these are just we're just talking about the surface of the ice. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  There's absolutely, you know, to say that that that it's hopeless. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=89.96s)]
*  I'm not going to say that, because if we don't have any hope, we have always have had hope. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=95.12s)]
*  So it's it's it's hard. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=99.84s)]
*  It's very hard to watch from outside. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=102.52s)]
*  But the people are suffering by the day and they're losing their loved ones by the day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=104.24s)]
*  Paint me a picture, if you will, of just the level of food insecurity and how widespread it is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we have the reports that are from the ground. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=116.44s)]
*  These are data. These are not opinions. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  These are facts that we have from World Food Program, from UNICEF, from from a lot of from [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=120.4s)]
*  a lot of NGOs that are that are gathering this data, also Afghan NGOs that are based on the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  ground. And somehow somehow these numbers do not scare us in a way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, they have over 20 close to 25 million people that are in the brink of starvation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=136.28s)]
*  And we have millions of young girls that are not going to school. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=141.56s)]
*  And just because there is not any, you know, huge bombs or attacks that are happening from the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=144.68s)]
*  Taliban side does not mean that there's peace. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=151.56s)]
*  People are really in bad shape in Afghanistan. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=154.28s)]
*  Want to get to your book here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=158.4s)]
*  And this is really an anthology of essays of your conversations with 13 dynamic, incredible [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  women in Afghanistan who work there and how their lives have been impacted by what's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=166.16s)]
*  happening. And I guess one of the conversations struck me. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=172.16s)]
*  I think it was Mariam Safi, one of the women you profile, and she'd been involved in so [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=177.24s)]
*  many different peacebuilding efforts in Afghanistan. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=183.64s)]
*  And how crucial was it that women were just not at the table when it was decided that there [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  was going to be a negotiation with the Taliban? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=195.0s)]
*  I mean, what are the ripple effects of that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=197.16s)]
*  Mariam Safi is the expert, not about peacebuilding and peace. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=200.6s)]
*  She's a peace practitioner within Afghanistan, but in the region when it comes to policy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=204.64s)]
*  building and policy developments and all of these things that that are incredibly important [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=209.44s)]
*  for a woman to be involved in. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=215.68s)]
*  For example, she's been involved in giving her recommendations personally to the to the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=217.56s)]
*  General Assembly on several occasions, especially in the last year. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=224.52s)]
*  I said to the members that the international community is relegating the voices of women [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=229.56s)]
*  to the margins while treating the Taliban as the locals, giving them ownership of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=240.0s)]
*  process. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=246.72s)]
*  By saying that women were as we're posing as obstacles to a political settlement. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=250.76s)]
*  It didn't go anywhere. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=261.88s)]
*  No one heard. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=264.44s)]
*  You know, we need each other. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=265.92s)]
*  The international community needs these women and and the Afghan Afghanistan needs international [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=266.92s)]
*  in order to have a connected, you know, this connection has to be made. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=272.52s)]
*  It's not about building bridges, but in a way, there's nobody that knows this country [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=277.84s)]
*  better than the likes of Mariam Safi. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  There's a theme in the book that I find interesting, which is that there's a generation and you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=286.32s)]
*  call it the freedom generation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=291.28s)]
*  There's a generation of women who grew up in Afghanistan, not knowing life under the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=292.28s)]
*  Taliban. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=297.56s)]
*  And they are now coming into adulthood, into power or were coming into positions of power [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=298.56s)]
*  when this happened. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=304.36s)]
*  You know, Harry, there's one thing that I've learned while writing about Afghan women in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=305.36s)]
*  the past few years, and this one especially, which is a very personal book to me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=311.4s)]
*  This is another level of courage and bravery that that is that is being shown. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=318.08s)]
*  I have interviewed women from all walks of life, not only in Afghanistan, but in different [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=324.48s)]
*  places when it comes to Afghanistan, in spite of all of these difficulties, in spite of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=328.64s)]
*  all of these obstacles, these young girls, they still are working on the ground. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=333.68s)]
*  They're still on the streets of Afghanistan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=339.16s)]
*  You know, it's the protests were started. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=341.08s)]
*  It was the young women. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=343.92s)]
*  Razia Barakzai is one of them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=344.92s)]
*  She was the first one that collected literally and she knows a lot of people on the ground. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=346.24s)]
*  And she collected these. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=350.88s)]
*  At the end, there were only five girls. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=352.84s)]
*  They stood on the 16th of August. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=355.12s)]
*  They stood in front of the palace and started the protests. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=357.12s)]
*  That was the first wave of the protests. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=359.92s)]
*  And I remember that I was I actually spoke to her yesterday on the phone and she has [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=362.12s)]
*  been changing her location literally by the week for one full year and death threats and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=368.4s)]
*  name it and everything. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=374.52s)]
*  But she still is, you know, delegating and collaborating with different groups around [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  the world now through online channels than God. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=381.08s)]
*  And I remember there's one thing that I remember that truly I had to hold my tears and I'm [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  a tough cookie. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=389.04s)]
*  She said, Nahid, what saved us was the iPhones because everybody was filming. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  But she said, you think that I wasn't scared or we weren't scared? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=397.32s)]
*  We only had a paper with the shaking hands and we were standing in front of the barrel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=400.16s)]
*  of a gun. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=403.96s)]
*  And the only thing that saved us is because people were filming it and throwing it straight [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=405.56s)]
*  into social media. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=409.84s)]
*  So this is like I said, it's a different kind of level of bravery. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, these girls are still trying to get together, although they don't know anything about, you [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=415.96s)]
*  know, the as you mentioned, they don't know the Taliban firsthand, but they've read about [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=420.4s)]
*  them. They've read about their atrocities. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=425.0s)]
*  They've heard these stories. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about Razia Barakzai. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=429.12s)]
*  I mean, you you spoke to her recently and she's still in hiding for her safety. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  Yes, because she keeps she keeps getting texts that they know where she is. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  And she's been she's been on the road literally since the 16th of August, changed, changed [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  every two, three days, barely stayed with her parents because they were watching and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=450.32s)]
*  they had spies that were knocking on the door for different reasons every single day. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=455.96s)]
*  And we found a way for her. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=461.08s)]
*  She also found a couple of people have found a way for her to leave the country back then. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=463.0s)]
*  But because she's a single child, she's the only child and she didn't want to leave her [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=468.56s)]
*  parents and the parents were not allowed to leave with her. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  So this is another thing that we got to get our acts together when it's really people [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  that are in danger. We got to get them out. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=479.08s)]
*  And I'm not saying that we have to evacuate 40 million people. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=482.96s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=486.32s)]
*  We need to recognize who is really in danger and give them a helping hand. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=487.88s)]
*  When we talk about solidarity, this means solidarity. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  You also profile a couple of different women in there, Raya Sadat, the filmmaker, Ariana [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=498.36s)]
*  Said, the singer. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=502.56s)]
*  And it's interesting because the role of the arts is one of the things that's radically [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=504.56s)]
*  changed that you point out how core to the culture of Afghanistan singing, for example, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=512.24s)]
*  was. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=519.64s)]
*  And yet now there are literally fatwas against religious edicts against women who are practitioners [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=520.64s)]
*  in the arts. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=530.48s)]
*  I'm an artist. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=532.8s)]
*  I've been painting for over 33 years. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=533.8s)]
*  My way of communicating is through these different formats, whether it's the books, the film, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=537.48s)]
*  you know, written word. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  I find that creativity using creativity is the best way to reach the audience. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=545.76s)]
*  That's my point of view. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=551.0s)]
*  Now when it comes to music and arts within the culture, it has always been there, underfunded [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=552.4s)]
*  as most cultures in every single culture in the world, arts are underfunded. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=558.32s)]
*  When it comes to music specifically, that has been something that I've always had to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=562.76s)]
*  deal with within the community of African communities. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=567.04s)]
*  It has been a conservative thing. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=569.76s)]
*  You know, women are not supposed to be singing all of that stuff. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=571.2s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they don't, that they didn't go forward with that beautiful [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=574.12s)]
*  universal language. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=582.52s)]
*  So to have that completely banned, it is truly Taliban are taking the soul of my country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=583.52s)]
*  They're stealing it completely. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=591.88s)]
*  We are not a colorless culture, never have been. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=593.72s)]
*  This is you're talking about thousands of years of culture. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=597.08s)]
*  You know, so many civilizations passed through that. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=599.92s)]
*  They left their little marks in there, whether it's through the fine arts, whether it's through [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=602.24s)]
*  archaeological sites, whether it's through music. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=607.6s)]
*  We have had this in our culture and every single, whoever that knows Afghans, you need [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=610.08s)]
*  a reason to just have a good food and lots of people in there and good music in our gatherings [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=615.16s)]
*  and dance and sing. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=621.36s)]
*  And that's the culture that we know and that has that have been, you know, through generations [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=622.9200000000001s)]
*  and generations given to us. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=627.24s)]
*  And for them to be stealing that part of our our the soul of our country, it is just unacceptable. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=629.0s)]
*  And that is that is something that whether it's Ariana or Roya or Radha Akbar, for example, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=635.88s)]
*  she had the plans to open the first National Museum for Women in Afghanistan. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  They're not very national women, national museums in the world. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=648.8s)]
*  A few countries have it, but that wasn't the plan. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=651.72s)]
*  You know, so these are the kind of again, I go back to the progress. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=654.88s)]
*  Give these women the respect that they deserve, that they achieved all of this with inactive war. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  That's what people forget. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=665.48s)]
*  Before the 15th of August last year, that was not a rosy, all OK country. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=667.04s)]
*  We have we have dodged like I personally have dodged suicide bombers, attacks, name it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=673.12s)]
*  We all have all of these women have, you know, Fozikofi couldn't even write her article, her chapter. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=678.96s)]
*  I had to write it for her because she was shot a year before by the same Taliban that are ruling today. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=683.56s)]
*  And she couldn't move her arms. So I had to write for her. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=689.24s)]
*  I wrote her her chapter. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=691.84s)]
*  So these are realities that we don't really seem to take seriously in a way. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=693.84s)]
*  But the artists, the artists, especially the artists, were were giving the soul of the country to the next generations. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=700.16s)]
*  And that has stopped completely right now. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=707.4s)]
*  What are the steps that nation states should be taking to try to, I guess, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=709.9599999999999s)]
*  re-empower the women who might understand the space the best? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  First and foremost, see them, hear them and then listen to them. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=722.3199999999999s)]
*  They are there. They do the work. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=728.4s)]
*  They still do the work. They are working with the EU's, with the with the UN's, with all of these governments anyways. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=731.0s)]
*  But when the time comes to give that space to the to the expert, we have to do the due diligence. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=737.32s)]
*  Take that five minutes and Google that. And if you can't find them, just it just literally just ask anybody in this book and they will be able to connect you with anybody. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  So what are they supposed to do? Get them to sit with you on the tables. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=754.76s)]
*  I've watched certain shows where there's absolutely not one single Afghan in that show speaking about Afghanistan. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=759.84s)]
*  So why do we do that? Why do we make those those decisions when it really matters? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=767.28s)]
*  We should have learned, especially in the last year, that it doesn't get us anywhere, that, you know, this this data, these narratives that are coming out, we have data that that says the complete opposite. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=771.28s)]
*  So listen to these women, see them, give them the spaces that they deserve, give them their spaces back and the tiny little space that is left. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  And that is due to to a lot. It has a lot to do with the Ukraine war, which is a war that is extremely, extremely important to keep in mind and give the space and pay attention because it is, you know, as an Afghan, my heart goes to the Ukrainian people. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=792.8s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that you don't talk about the rest of it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  One of the threads that's in the book, it's interesting. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=811.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you interviewed such a range of women from educators to activists to artists to politicians that that there seems to be also a savior complex that comes from the outside. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=814.12s)]
*  And most of the women that you're talking to really in their own way are talking about how they are not victims. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=826.3599999999999s)]
*  That. How should the conversation around Afghan women be framed? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=835.8s)]
*  See them as they are. I mean, we are we are looking at Afghan women and trying to romanticize it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=844.76s)]
*  We are trying to objectify them. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=853.56s)]
*  I was having a conversation with Maryam Safi actually a few weeks ago and and we were talking about this and she said, you know, she was saying in this line of thought and we're there. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=855.92s)]
*  The Afghan women are being romanticized to the point that they become exotic and this exoticism, this this this othering that they're so far away that we don't have to deal with it in a way. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=867.28s)]
*  There's nothing exotic about me or any of the women in this book or any of the Afghan women. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=877.8s)]
*  We are truly capable of talking about any other subject, but Afghan women or women issues as well. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=882.76s)]
*  And this is really, really important to point that you do not kind of limit our knowledge and our beings into the war torn countries. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=889.0s)]
*  Women, we are women, period. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=901.96s)]
*  And we are very capable of doing that. What we do best, which is in this case, when it comes to Afghanistan, because we have been so involved in Afghanistan, then we can analyze certain things, you know, because we have been there on the ground. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=905.68s)]
*  We still are on the ground in a way. And we work on the ground. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=918.12s)]
*  And and this is what is really, really important that we don't romanticize about about Afghan women. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=921.7199999999999s)]
*  There's nothing exotic about us. So so just see us as we are. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=927.52s)]
*  The book is called We Are Still Here Afghan Women on the Courage, Freedom and the Fight to Be Heard. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  Nihill, the media editor. Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=938.76s)]
*  I thank you very much for having me. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjjOBv8d4oo&t=941.3599999999999s)]
