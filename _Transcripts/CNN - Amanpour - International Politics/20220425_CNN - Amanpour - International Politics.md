Video Description: Emmanuel Macron is the first French president in two decades to win re-election, comfortably beating his hard-right challenger Marine Le Pen in the second round this weekend. It is a result that reinforces the pro-NATO western alliance at a crucial time, as Putin’s war in Ukraine grinds towards its 62nd day. Given Le Pen’s ties to – and sympathies with – Putin and his worldview, it is also no doubt a disappointing result for the Kremlin. Even so, Le Pen improved on her 2017 second round performance by 7 points; voter turnout was low, by French standards; and there are parliamentary elections in six weeks’ time. Indeed, Le Pen herself declared a great victory last night. For more on this, Christiane, from Paris, speaks with Laurence Haïm, a French journalist who served as Macron’s spokesperson during his presidential campaign in 2017.

# Re-Elected French President Macron Has to Unite the Country  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us)
*  Macron has to unite the country and he knows that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=0.0s)]
*  And we're going to see in the following weeks how he's going to try to go to the left side, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=5.0s)]
*  to go to the right center, because he knows that traditional politics is over. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=10.0s)]
*  So that's a good thing then. This is a really important time for that kind of unity to be forged. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=15.0s)]
*  It has to be united, otherwise it's going to be a disaster. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=21.0s)]
*  And that's the lesson of the French elections. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=24.0s)]
*  Usually in France we're always saying, you know what's happening in America, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=26.0s)]
*  it's happening four years later in France or five years later. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=30.0s)]
*  Now France might give a lesson to the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=34.0s)]
*  There's no classical party anymore, it's completely dead. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=38.0s)]
*  The socialist party is under five percent. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=42.0s)]
*  The classical republican party is a disaster. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=45.0s)]
*  So you have Macron and you have the extremes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=50.0s)]
*  And Macron has to recompose the French political society. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=53.0s)]
*  Okay, so you were his spokesperson during the 2017 campaign. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=57.0s)]
*  You spent a lot of time with him, you got to know his style, his professional style, probably a bit of his personal style. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=62.0s)]
*  What? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=69.0s)]
*  As a journalist I can be critical now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=71.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course you can. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=74.0s)]
*  So what does he need to do? What is his character and how will it help him? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=75.0s)]
*  I think he's a lonely person and I think he trusts one person, his wife. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=80.0s)]
*  And sometimes when you're working for him it could have been difficult because he's listening. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=86.0s)]
*  But you know we're saying that when you're a politician it's good to have a counter power. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=92.0s)]
*  And I think with Emmanuel Macron you can see sometimes his loneliness. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=97.0s)]
*  He's absolutely convinced that he's the right who is going to make the final decision. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=101.0s)]
*  He's surrounded, and that's also something which was quite interesting and the French people noticed, he's surrounded by what we call in France technocrats. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=107.0s)]
*  So there's a kind of contradiction in the Macron character about his ability to bring the civil society to help him and his trying, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=115.0s)]
*  but the inability for the political professional team to work with the civil society. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=125.0s)]
*  And I think it's going to be the challenge for him. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=133.0s)]
*  Is he going to surround himself by technocrats, by people who went to school, or is he going to open his mandate to the civil society? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=136.0s)]
*  And you can see again, poll after poll, when you go to the street, when you speak as you did to the French people, they want something else in politics. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=147.0s)]
*  Traditional politics doesn't work anymore and Macron has to find something which is not the populist message, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=155.0s)]
*  but which is a message open and listening to the civil society. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJhjrBW00Us&t=163.0s)]
