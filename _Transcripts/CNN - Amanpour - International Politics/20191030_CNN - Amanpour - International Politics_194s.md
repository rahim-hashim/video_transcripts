# Anita Hill on Trump’s Use of the Word “Lynching:” "That is Ludicrous" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI)
*  I want to ask you about that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=0.0s)]
*  Quickly, Trump using the word lynching [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=0.9400000000000001s)]
*  about the impeachment process. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=2.96s)]
*  That is ludicrous. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=4.84s)]
*  It's just ludicrous. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=9.52s)]
*  The idea that a person with this kind of power and authority [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=11.96s)]
*  could co-opt this language on his own personal behalf [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  is ludicrous and insulting. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=25.5s)]
*  And we need to call it out for that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=27.7s)]
*  But we also have to go back to the reality [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  that this is a tactic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=33.1s)]
*  This is a tactic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=35.3s)]
*  It's a divisive tactic to get people to push back [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=36.54s)]
*  on any kind of challenges. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=41.18s)]
*  And so it's not really that different from what [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=43.66s)]
*  happened in 1991. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=46.9s)]
*  Again, on the theme of equality and accountability, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  you've obviously said, and many do, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=52.22s)]
*  that gender equality in any walk of life, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=54.1s)]
*  particularly in politics and governance and leadership, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=57.66s)]
*  just changes the whole playing field. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=60.26s)]
*  There are six, as I said, female candidates right now [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  for president on the Democratic side. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=65.1s)]
*  Do you believe that this country is misogynistic still, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  that it will not vote for a female? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=69.86s)]
*  Well, the country did vote for a female in the last election. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=72.7s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  But the electoral college in Eater Hill. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=81.3s)]
*  So the electoral college maybe doesn't reflect the country. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=84.3s)]
*  And maybe that's the problem. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  So I think that we, in order, what we don't often comprehend [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=89.38s)]
*  is to get beyond gender discrimination to move on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  We've got to deal with a whole lot of other kinds [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  of discrimination too. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=103.96s)]
*  Because women come in all kinds of forms and shapes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=105.5s)]
*  and fashions and races and sexualities [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=109.46s)]
*  and sexual identities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=111.98s)]
*  And if we can say, OK, well, I'm not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  going to discriminate against you on the basis of your gender, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  but I'm going to discriminate against this woman [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=119.56s)]
*  on the basis of her race, then we're never [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  going to get full gender equality. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=124.66s)]
*  You can't parse it out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=127.06s)]
*  And so we're going to have to deal with a lot of other bias [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=128.9s)]
*  to get to full gender equality. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=132.02s)]
*  And I say that as someone who has dealt [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=136.74s)]
*  with the intersection of race and gender, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=140.14s)]
*  that's not the only intersection there is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=142.98s)]
*  But that is an important one for us [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=145.98s)]
*  to really try to wrap our brains around [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  and understand that those overlapping biases can push [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  women back individually and as a group. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=156.22s)]
*  And finally, have you decided who to endorse? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=160.33999999999997s)]
*  And have you forgiven Joe Biden for what happened in 1991? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  I have not decided who to do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=166.7s)]
*  I've never endorsed a presidential candidate for once, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=169.22s)]
*  so this is not new. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=172.02s)]
*  And have I forgiven Joe Biden? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=173.82s)]
*  I'm ready to move on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzpMLHNGEI&t=176.46s)]
