# Finnish President Putin Is Clearly Making a Nuclear Threat  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU)
*  So when you ask him, Mr. President, you've said all sorts of things about putting your deterrent forces on combat alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=0.0s)]
*  You've said that anybody who dares to interfere with your project will face consequences the like of which we've never seen in history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=7.0s)]
*  I mean, that is a nuclear threat, isn't it? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=16.0s)]
*  It is. It is something like that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=18.0s)]
*  That reminds me of Dr. Kissinger. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=22.0s)]
*  He has once said that whenever peace is under discussion with international actors, they are on the mercy of the most ruthless. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=25.0s)]
*  And in this case? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=37.0s)]
*  It seems to be the case. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=39.0s)]
*  Putin is the most ruthless? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=41.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=42.0s)]
*  Do you believe... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=43.0s)]
*  By indicating that there will be a huge mess. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, it's more than a mess. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=48.0s)]
*  It's more than a mess. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=50.0s)]
*  ...an existential disaster. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=51.0s)]
*  Disaster. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=52.0s)]
*  Do you believe, and have you asked him, whether he would take that ultimate escalatory step? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=53.0s)]
*  He only repeated that terrible things will happen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=59.0s)]
*  So you directly asked him? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=64.0s)]
*  Yes. I told him that don't you see that the pressure from ordinary people grows all the time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=66.0s)]
*  It's not only anymore that the Russian reputation is gone, but now they are even more worried what happens with those people being killed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=74.0s)]
*  And don't you see that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, then he said that if NATO countries take action, so terrible things will happen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=89.0s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=100.0s)]
*  No, I'm not scared. And Finns are not scared. But surely we are fully awake. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=102.0s)]
*  Fully awake? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=110.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXNHgvVqWSU&t=111.0s)]
