Video Description: Independent journalism has been all but silenced in Russia under new censorship laws that make it a crime to call the war a war, or to say Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure. But Yevgenia Albats continues to defy the government’s restrictions. She is editor-in-chief of The New Times magazine, and a radio host at Echo of Moscow – both independent media organizations recently shut down by the Kremlin. She risks imprisonment to join Michel Martin from Moscow and discuss the danger of a misinformation war.

# Putin Is “A Sick Man With a Sick Mind,” Says Moscow-Based Journalist | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao)
*  Now, as we've talked about the propaganda war and what information people are getting, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=0.0s)]
*  independent journalism has been all but silenced in Russia under new censorship laws that do [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=5.54s)]
*  make it a crime to call the war a war, or to say that Russia is attacking civilian infrastructure. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Evgenia Albatz continues to defy the government's draconian restrictions. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=17.06s)]
*  She's editor-in-chief of the New Times Magazine and a radio host at Echo Moskvy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=21.34s)]
*  Both are independent media organizations recently shut down by the Kremlin. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=26.46s)]
*  Despite risking imprisonment, she's joining Michelle Martin from Moscow to discuss the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=31.26s)]
*  dangers of a misinformation war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=35.92s)]
*  Thanks, Christian. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=38.6s)]
*  Evgenia Albatz, thanks so much for talking with us once again. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=39.6s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=44.88s)]
*  And I'm very sorry about the circumstances. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=46.64s)]
*  As delighted as I am to speak with you, I mean, you're the editor and CEO of the New [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=48.58s)]
*  Times. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=52.28s)]
*  That's a Russia-based independent political site. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=53.540000000000006s)]
*  You were also a talk show host at Echo Moskvy, an independent radio agency, the largest [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=56.38s)]
*  in Russia, and over the past two weeks, both were shut down by the Russian government and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=62.1s)]
*  accessible to people who have VPN. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=66.66s)]
*  Do you know why they were shut down? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=69.1s)]
*  Did anyone say anything to you? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=70.54s)]
*  Was anything said? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=72.42s)]
*  First of all, I have to say that I feel ashamed that I'm a citizen of the country that started [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=73.42s)]
*  the war of choice and of conquest, and that my friends and people whom I don't know in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=80.52s)]
*  Ukraine, but hundreds of them, are dying right now under the Russian bombs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=87.52s)]
*  And I feel very, very sorry that my country is doing that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=92.6s)]
*  As for the Russian media and the Echo Moskvy broadcasting and the Times in particular, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=98.4s)]
*  the problem was that Russian Ministry of Truth, the special agency which oversees all communications [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  in my country, they pronounce the words war, offense, and invasion with respect to events [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  in Ukraine as forbidden for us to use. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=124.94s)]
*  Of course, on my website and in my show at Echo Moskvy, we were using the word that we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  were supposed to use, that's exactly what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  There is a war. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=140.44000000000003s)]
*  However, we live now in this Orwellian world where everything is opposite. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=142.28s)]
*  People say words and in fact they mean exactly the opposite. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=149.28000000000003s)]
*  They say war and they mean peace, or they say peace and they mean war. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=153.4s)]
*  They say truth and they mean lies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=158.32s)]
*  So that's why we got shut down, it's not just us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  Sixteen different independent publications and websites were closed, more than 160 reporters [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=165.5s)]
*  and editors immigrated. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  Basically, nothing exists but some blogs on YouTube. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=176.26s)]
*  When they shut you down, did they say anything? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=182.5s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=184.74s)]
*  They sent us letters saying that no war happens, that there is no invasion, no war, no offense. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  It's just a special operation by the Russian troops. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=196.12s)]
*  What Russian troops are doing in Ukraine? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=199.96s)]
*  Of course, they're liberating Ukrainians from nationalists and Nazis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=201.36s)]
*  Of course, they're preventing, it's a preventive operation because basically, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=206.36s)]
*  NATO is standing by the Russian borders and about to start an offense on Russia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=214.06s)]
*  Listen, it's all kind of lies. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=221.06s)]
*  So here in the United States, where I am now, we see footage from our correspondents every [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=223.18s)]
*  day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=229.46s)]
*  We see that, for example, a maternity hospital was bombed yesterday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=230.46s)]
*  We've seen civilian cars fired up. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  So in Russia, what would people see? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=235.74s)]
*  People wouldn't see any of that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=238.38000000000002s)]
*  They've not seen any of that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  There is a state propaganda machine. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=242.74s)]
*  These are all networks which cover all Russian 11 time zones. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=245.24s)]
*  Of course, they don't show any of that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  War doesn't exist on the Russian propaganda channel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=253.68s)]
*  However, there is also internet and those people who have VPN, it is a virtual private [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=257.92s)]
*  network. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=267.04s)]
*  All of us would have it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=268.04s)]
*  That's what allows us to still read Facebook, to read Twitter and to get on the websites [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=269.92s)]
*  and see the footage. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=275.12s)]
*  There's also telegram channels where you can get all kinds of footage from Ukraine. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=277.48s)]
*  Those people who want to know, who are looking for the information, they can get the information [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=284.38s)]
*  from the web. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=289.38s)]
*  However, a large majority of Russians, they are accustomed to the fact that they are not [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=290.88s)]
*  believe in the propaganda machine. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  I would suspect that about half of those polled, they watch Russian propaganda TV channels [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=303.32s)]
*  and therefore these were not a support to war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=311.68s)]
*  How are people understanding what is happening? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=315.68s)]
*  The fact that the value of ruble has fallen so dramatically, the fact that a number of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=318.44s)]
*  Western, highly visible Western companies are shutting down their operations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=323.16s)]
*  How is this being explained to the public? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=328.84s)]
*  Russian currency lost about 30%. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  People's savings in hard currency, they are frozen on their accounts. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=336.67999999999995s)]
*  They can get only $10,000 for a period of six months. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=342.0s)]
*  A lot of companies, yesterday it was announced that McDonald's, which was the manifestation [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=347.0s)]
*  of the new Soviet Union of Perestroika. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=354.0s)]
*  McDonald's is about to close all the 850 stores and 62,000 people will be out of jobs. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=357.76s)]
*  It's true for, but it's the same, there is a problem for professionals. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=368.8s)]
*  For instance, all five big audit companies, Ernst & Young, Pricewaterhouse, Cooper and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=374.52s)]
*  others, they are also announced that they are going to shut down the country. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=382.92s)]
*  It means only in Ernst & Young there are 3600 people work. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=387.52s)]
*  People will be out of jobs, Starbucks, everything. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=391.96s)]
*  I believe something like about 265 different companies, Western companies are working away [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=395.32s)]
*  from Russia. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  That means that thousands and thousands of people will be off the jobs. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  But also it suggests that because of the ruble deviation, poor people are going to be even [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  poor. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=416.88s)]
*  We know that inflation, and it's already over 20%, inflation is a tax on poor. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=419.08000000000004s)]
*  People will be suffering. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=425.36s)]
*  We are just two weeks into the war. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  It's too early for many to feel the burden of this war. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=431.56s)]
*  What do you think Putin's end game is? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry, I cannot read the crystal ball. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=443.92s)]
*  I think that we are dealing with a sick man with a sick mind. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=448.92s)]
*  I think that he has his own view of the world. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=456.92s)]
*  In this world, he would like to live a legacy of a guy who recreated, at least in the 80s, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=461.92s)]
*  a small part of the Soviet Union. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=472.92s)]
*  So I guess the whole idea is to occupy Ukraine, to conquer Ukraine, to install the puppet [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=476.92s)]
*  government, and to make Ukraine, Belarus and Russia this pan-Slavic state. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=486.92s)]
*  Whether he will go further or not, it's very hard to say. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=495.92s)]
*  However, having said that, keep in mind that according to the sources, the Russian government [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=498.92s)]
*  of Kremlin was planning to conquer Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, in the matter of three [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=506.92s)]
*  days. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  We're already 14 days into the war. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  And we see that there are probably Russian troops having problems getting supply, getting [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  gasoline, getting food. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=524.92s)]
*  And there are not enough resources. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=528.92s)]
*  Putin doesn't want to announce mobilization. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=531.92s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if 10 days from now Putin announced that the Russian army fulfilled [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=535.92s)]
*  it, and the war is over. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=545.92s)]
*  And so, and Russia will withdraw. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=549.92s)]
*  It can go like that, but once again, I'm not good enough to read the crystal ball. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=551.92s)]
*  It may go much worse. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=557.92s)]
*  And I don't want even to predict the big war in Europe, as some analysts say. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=559.92s)]
*  So it can go different ways, and we have to know now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=569.92s)]
*  You've just described a situation that's become very difficult for Russians. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=573.92s)]
*  Is there any sense that the frustration that Russians feel will be directed toward the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=578.92s)]
*  regime, and that they will in some way seek their own regime change, if that's even possible? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=584.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, in these type of regimes and dictatorships, regimes rarely fail because [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=593.92s)]
*  of the popular mobilization. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=602.92s)]
*  It's the split of the elite that may lead to the change of the regime. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=604.92s)]
*  So I think that a lot of rich people in this country, people who were Putin's constituency, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=610.92s)]
*  Putin's supporters, people who became billionaires and millionaires over the last 20 years of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=618.92s)]
*  Putin's rule, these people are extremely upset and extremely frustrated because they lost [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=625.92s)]
*  millions of dollars. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=633.92s)]
*  Unlike it was in the Soviet Union, where there was some sort of ideology, which was called [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=635.92s)]
*  communism, or you can call it religion, but it doesn't matter. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=639.92s)]
*  There was an ideology. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=643.92s)]
*  There is no ideology in the contemporary Russia. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=645.92s)]
*  They are partonists. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=649.92s)]
*  They believe in the power of the dollar. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=651.92s)]
*  That's their biggest belief. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=653.92s)]
*  And so now, you know, they're losing their offshore accounts. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=655.92s)]
*  They're losing their savings. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=658.92s)]
*  Russian stock market went down the hill and Russian blue chips became just a piece of paper. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=660.92s)]
*  They got accustomed to live in Russia and make money in Russia. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=666.92s)]
*  However, they got accustomed to spend this money outside Russia. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=671.92s)]
*  So for these people, it is a disaster that they are not ready to live in the Golden Cage, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=675.92s)]
*  as Soviets didn't. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=683.92s)]
*  So I'm absolutely aware that these people, sooner or later, will start to push buttons in order to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=686.92s)]
*  return back the kind of life that they got accustomed to during the last 30 years of post-Soviet Russia. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=695.92s)]
*  Evgenia, I'm working my way up to asking, how are you doing? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=702.92s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=706.92s)]
*  This is not just your career. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=708.92s)]
*  This is something you've dedicated your life to. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=710.92s)]
*  Even to the point, I must say, for people who may have heard our earlier conversation on this program, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=712.92s)]
*  even to the point of your sending your daughter out of the country so that you could do not have to worry [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=718.92s)]
*  about her safety while you are pursuing this work. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=723.92s)]
*  You've had opportunities to work in the United States. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=726.92s)]
*  You've chosen to go back to your country in order to serve the public there. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=728.92s)]
*  And I just cannot imagine what this is like for you right now. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=733.92s)]
*  You know, thank you very much. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=737.92s)]
*  I really appreciate your concern. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=739.92s)]
*  I should tell you that it is my choice. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=742.92s)]
*  And I love it here, to be honest with you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=747.92s)]
*  I love writing in Russian. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=751.92s)]
*  I love Russian language around me. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=754.92s)]
*  It's very interesting to observe the development of the regime in Russia. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=757.92s)]
*  I wrote about that so many times in my life. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=762.92s)]
*  And now I see where I was right in my predictions and where I was wrong. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=765.92s)]
*  So it's very interesting. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=770.92s)]
*  It's very, it's not, you know, I don't feel, of course, happy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=772.92s)]
*  As I said, I feel very, very shame. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=777.92s)]
*  It just boggles my mind that Russian troops are killing Russian soldiers. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=780.92s)]
*  I traveled to Ukraine so many times. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=788.92s)]
*  My father, Mark Halibaz, was parachuted on the Nazi occupied Ukraine back during the World War II in September of 1941. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=791.92s)]
*  You know, he fought along, you know, he was in the same trenches with Ukrainians and they fought the same enemy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=801.92s)]
*  And now all of a sudden, I got to know that my father, Mark Halibaz, was a Russian. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=809.92s)]
*  I got to know that my, I'm a taxpayer in this country and I pay taxes, you know, a lot of taxes in this country. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=816.92s)]
*  And I understand that now my taxes are going to the army, which conducts a war of choice. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=825.92s)]
*  And that makes me absolutely sick. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=836.92s)]
*  The Soviet Union lost 27 million people during the World War II. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=839.92s)]
*  And I just couldn't believe that we are doing this, you know. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=845.92s)]
*  There are all these famous poems. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=851.92s)]
*  Do Russians want the war? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=854.92s)]
*  And the answer was always no. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=857.92s)]
*  Of course, no. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=860.92s)]
*  I cannot be wanting the war because Russia's just Russian roads, Russian streets are all but graves. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=861.92s)]
*  So this is awful. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=871.92s)]
*  You know, you feel awful because you are unable to stop this. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=873.92s)]
*  What can I do? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=877.92s)]
*  I cannot stop this, you know, and the majority of my fellow colleagues, they immigrated. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=879.92s)]
*  So I'm trying to do stories so not to get in jail because Russian government passed new repressive laws that make anyone who write what they consider fake news, the punishment is 15 years in jail. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=884.92s)]
*  Do you think you might get arrested? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=907.92s)]
*  Do you anticipate? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=909.92s)]
*  I don't want to be arrested. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=910.92s)]
*  I don't want even to guess about this. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=911.92s)]
*  But, you know, if it's going to happen, then it will happen. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=914.92s)]
*  You know, I'm prepared, of course, for that. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=917.92s)]
*  You know, I have a bag ready. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=919.92s)]
*  It's standing by the door. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=921.92s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, I don't want to get to end up in jail. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=923.92s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=926.92s)]
*  I'm not suicidal. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=927.92s)]
*  I'm not a martyr. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=928.92s)]
*  And, you know, I just it just happened. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=930.92s)]
*  It's unfortunate development of the web. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=934.92s)]
*  Evgeny, can you explain just how close Russia and Ukraine are or how close Russians and Ukrainians are? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=937.92s)]
*  Aren't some of your grandparents Ukrainian? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=945.92s)]
*  My grandparents lived in the shtetl in Ukraine. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=949.92s)]
*  My grandparents were Jewish. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=954.92s)]
*  There are three Slavic nations, Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=957.92s)]
*  They the absolute majority of them are Russian Orthodox. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=964.92s)]
*  They speak the same language. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=970.92s)]
*  They are culturally very close. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=972.92s)]
*  They linguistically very close. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=975.92s)]
*  There is a city, Kharkiv. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=978.92s)]
*  It's just 35 kilometers from the border with Russia. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=980.92s)]
*  It's totally it's downtown, totally destroyed. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=984.92s)]
*  However, 95 percent of those who live in Kharkiv, they do speak Russian. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=987.92s)]
*  So that's why it sounds so impossible that Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=993.92s)]
*  Once again, we are the country which are culturally, religiously and linguistically extremely close. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1003.92s)]
*  However, Ukraine, Ukraine has been trying very hard to gain its statehood, to to be able to do it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1011.92s)]
*  Gaining status as a sovereign nation for centuries, Ukrainians were were fighting for that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1022.92s)]
*  And now, you know, when they finally became a nation and we can see they fight as the nation, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1029.92s)]
*  as people who are ready to defend their land and to defend their statehood. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1038.92s)]
*  You know, they my troops, Russian troops came and they're trying to destroy whatever Ukrainians [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1045.92s)]
*  managed to build over the period of 30 years of their independence that they gained after Soviet Union collapse. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1055.92s)]
*  So before we let you go, what is there anything that would make a difference now? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1063.92s)]
*  There are quite a few things, but let me tell you that I am a citizen of the Russian Federation. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1069.92s)]
*  I cannot wish the defeat of my own country. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1074.92s)]
*  I don't want my fellow citizens to suffer more than they already do, even though we are responsible for what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1079.92s)]
*  Still, you know, I think that there are different minds in your part of the world who know what to do. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1089.92s)]
*  Yes, there should be much more to be done. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1096.92s)]
*  And there is, you know, all kinds of steps that can be taken in Ukraine. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1099.92s)]
*  But once again, I don't want to devise on that because it means killing of my fellow of fellow citizens, those troops in Ukraine. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1105.92s)]
*  And once again, I should say that I feel ashamed and I'm so sorry that Ukrainians are so ashamed. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1118.92s)]
*  And I think that Ukrainians are suffering from the deeds of those who do what they do at my expense, at the expense of the taxpayer. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1128.92s)]
*  Evgenia Alves, thank you so much for speaking with us and thank you for your important work. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1141.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1146.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQuc77Q39ao&t=1158.92s)]
