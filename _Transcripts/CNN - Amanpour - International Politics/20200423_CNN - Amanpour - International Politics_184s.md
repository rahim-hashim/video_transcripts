# Former British PM Renews Call for Coordinated Global Effort Against COVID-19  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [April 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY)
*  What do you think and do you believe it's on the way [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=0.0s)]
*  needs to be done, can be done to make this a global response? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=4.2s)]
*  Look, it's obvious. We've got America first. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  We've got China first. We've got India first. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=11.44s)]
*  We've got Japan first. We've got Russia first. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=13.4s)]
*  And this has been a tendency, a trend of the times, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=15.8s)]
*  an aggressive unilateral nationalism. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=18.6s)]
*  But I think most people realize [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=20.8s)]
*  that this is a global economic emergency [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=24.2s)]
*  and it's also a global health emergency. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=27.84s)]
*  And I think people realize that unless we solve the problem [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  in some of the poorest countries of the world, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=33.24s)]
*  which could bring the disease back into the richest countries of the world, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=35.64s)]
*  we will not solve the problem at all. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=39.64s)]
*  We need a global effort on the vaccine. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=41.84s)]
*  We need to build up global capacity in testing equipment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=44.04s)]
*  We need to protect these countries [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=47.44s)]
*  so that they don't carry the disease back into the rest of the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=49.44s)]
*  So for all these reasons, people sitting at home this evening, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=53.44s)]
*  I think, do realize that to protect themselves locally, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=56.44s)]
*  we have got to act globally. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  We're concerned about our families, about our communities, about our country, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  but we've got to act globally if we're going to rid ourselves of this disease. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=64.84s)]
*  So I'm going to play this little bit of a soundbite from Dr Ted Ross, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=70.84s)]
*  the Director General of the World Health Organization, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=74.44s)]
*  basically amplifying what you're saying, but with a rather chilling warning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=77.44s)]
*  We need global solidarity. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=81.64s)]
*  That's cemented on genuine national unity. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=84.44s)]
*  Without the two, without national unity and global solidarity, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=90.44s)]
*  trust us, the worst is yet ahead of us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=96.44s)]
*  Let's prevent this tragedy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=103.44s)]
*  Prime Minister, that is really chilling to think that the worst is still ahead of us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=107.44s)]
*  Do you have commitments, do you have a game plan for this G20 appeal that you've made? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=111.44s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=118.44s)]
*  When he talks about the worst ahead of us, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=120.44s)]
*  I mean, the predictions are that at least 300,000 people may lose their life in Africa, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=122.44s)]
*  900,000 in Asia, in the poorest countries, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=126.44s)]
*  because they simply don't have the protection that we have. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=130.44s)]
*  They can't do social distancing in the way that we can. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=133.44s)]
*  There is no social safety net that allows them to stop working [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=136.44s)]
*  when they feel that their health is at risk, so they go to work and they risk their health. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=139.44s)]
*  And of course, there is no proper health provision testing ventilators. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=143.44s)]
*  And what problems we've seen in the developed world are even greater, obviously, in the developing world. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=148.44s)]
*  But solidarity is actually self-interest. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=154.44s)]
*  And I think people will understand when we explain that if you allow this disease [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=157.44s)]
*  to have a second round and a third round, then we're all going to be affected. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D29kV5eYBzY&t=163.44s)]
