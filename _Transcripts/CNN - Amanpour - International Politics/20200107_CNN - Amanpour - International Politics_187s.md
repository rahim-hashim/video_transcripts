# Ayad Allawi on Iraq’s Role in U.S.-Iran Tensions | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw)
*  First and foremost, how serious is Iraq's threat and its vote in parliament to expel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. forces? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=7.84s)]
*  I don't think it's very serious, really, because, you know, frankly speaking, we need [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=8.84s)]
*  to arrange a rule of engagements. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, the government did not do the rule of engagements with the forces assembled [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=16.6s)]
*  to fight ISIS, including the United States, of course, forces. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=23.26s)]
*  And the rules of engagements should have been very important to write down and to agree [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=28.36s)]
*  upon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=34.04s)]
*  This never happened, really. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=35.36s)]
*  And that's why the attack four days ago on Iraq soil was, frankly speaking, undermined [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=36.68s)]
*  all the sovereignty of the country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=46.68s)]
*  So you agree with the current leadership in Iraq, that this violated Iraq's sovereignty? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Of course, absolutely. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  But also the leadership in Iraq bear responsibility at the same time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=54.2s)]
*  I have told them long ago that they should really write down rules of engagements and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  agree with the Americans on rules of engagement. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=66.64s)]
*  What can the Americans do and what can they should not do? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=70.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, this never happened. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  And I think this was a great mistake that the Iraqis committed, and as well as the Americans [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=75.48s)]
*  also. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=81.36s)]
*  And what do you think is the next step since President Trump has threatened to sanction [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=82.48s)]
*  your country? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=85.76s)]
*  I mean, can your country actually afford to be sanctioned? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=86.76s)]
*  No, our country is very tired from the wars. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=89.88s)]
*  And let me express my views also on what happened, not only on this occasion, but really we have [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=94.68s)]
*  been victims of American and Iranian confrontations. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  And frankly speaking, what happened is the Iraqi people are suffering because of this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=109.32s)]
*  confrontation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=114.32s)]
*  So Iraq is being used as the battleground for this essential proxy war, not proxy war, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=115.32s)]
*  but indirect war between Iran and the US. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  It is a proxy war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=124.08s)]
*  And unfortunately, Iran also played a very negative role in interfering in Iraqi politics [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  and confiscated the decision of the Iraqi people in 2010 and now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=136.48s)]
*  And even Soleimani, the late Soleimani, told me once, I met him twice with a group of people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=142.48s)]
*  He said, we are against you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=149.56s)]
*  I said, yes, fine, and I'm against you also. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=151.16s)]
*  But why are you against me? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=154.32s)]
*  I am defending my country and you are here intruder on the country and you are trying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=155.32s)]
*  to play with the results of the elections. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=160.28s)]
*  So Iran was having a direct influence politically as well as militarily. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=163.32s)]
*  Politically, absolutely, and militarily and through proxies, of course. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-7ozHFmTw&t=166.95999999999998s)]
