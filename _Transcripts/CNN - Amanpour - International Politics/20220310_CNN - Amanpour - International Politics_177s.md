# Ben Hodges: “I Believe That Ukraine Is Going To Win" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM)
*  So let me ask you, do you, from what you see on the maps and from your experience as a ground commander [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=0.0s)]
*  and commander of all forces Europe, is there the time and is NATO doing it fast enough to get this stuff to the Ukrainians [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=6.0s)]
*  so that it's useful before it's too late? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=18.0s)]
*  So there's two questions there, that and what do you see Russia doing on the ground right now in terms of speed of attack? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=21.0s)]
*  So let me frame it first by saying I believe that Ukraine is going to win in the end here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=30.0s)]
*  Of course there's no guarantee, but based on what I've seen of Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian population, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=37.0s)]
*  they're defending their home country, they know the terrain. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=44.0s)]
*  As long as we continue to provide the weapons and ammunition, the things that they need, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=48.0s)]
*  I believe that they can stay in the fight until they have won, until the Russians have finally culminated. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=55.0s)]
*  Now I don't imagine someday there's going to be a big Russian surrender ceremony, nothing like that, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=61.0s)]
*  but what we're after is culmination of the Russian military effort. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=66.0s)]
*  And I actually believe that time is on our side. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=70.0s)]
*  The Russians have chosen a war of attrition because their original plans were unsuccessful. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=73.0s)]
*  And by the way, before I go any further, clearly there are going to be weeks and weeks of destruction, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=80.0s)]
*  more innocent people killed. This is going to be nasty for several more weeks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=86.0s)]
*  But if we think long term, you need to win a war of attrition, you need three things. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=90.0s)]
*  You need time, you need endless amounts of ammunition, and you need manpower. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=96.0s)]
*  And the Russians do not have enough of any of those three. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=101.0s)]
*  The sanctions are going to be taking place here, are taking effect over the next few weeks, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=105.0s)]
*  and that's going to shorten the amount of time that the Russians have. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=110.0s)]
*  And also the Russian population is a part of this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=114.0s)]
*  And I think at some point, and I'd like to come back to that, this is going to cut short the amount of time that the Kremlin has. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=118.0s)]
*  The second thing, resources, ammunition. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=124.0s)]
*  We are starting to get reports that the Russians are running low on critical, what we would call preferred munitions, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=128.0s)]
*  Iskander, Kalibr, some of the more destructive weapons. They don't have unlimited amounts. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=136.0s)]
*  I can tell you that we don't have enough ammunition. These things are very expensive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=141.0s)]
*  And so the Russians have been consuming ammunition at a much faster rate than they would have ever planned to do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=145.0s)]
*  And when they switch to the tactic of smashing cities, this really burns up a lot of your ammunition. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=151.0s)]
*  I think they're going to run out of ammunition and then manpower. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4mVFTR1KrM&t=158.0s)]
