# EXCLUSIVE Can President Putin be Deterred From Invasion?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE)
*  Now, many experts say that this could be the darkest day for Europe and the free world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=0.0s)]
*  since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and certainly the most serious peril to confront us since [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=4.64s)]
*  the end of the Cold War. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=10.78s)]
*  So again, how will Putin be deterred? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=12.42s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen is the president of the European Commission, and she's joining me [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=14.96s)]
*  now from Brussels, where they have also laid out and starting to announce a raft of sanctions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=19.04s)]
*  Thank you, and welcome back to this program at a moment of high crisis. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=24.86s)]
*  Can I first ask you, what I've asked all my other guests, is this an invasion? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=28.96s)]
*  Do you, at the EU, at the highest levels, define what Russia has done as an invasion [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  of Ukraine? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=38.92s)]
*  As an invasion of Ukraine? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=39.92s)]
*  At the moment, being itself, it is not a military invasion, but it is a serious breach of international [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=43.72s)]
*  law, the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent, and it is violating the sovereignty [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=50.64s)]
*  and the integrity of Ukraine, and therefore we have agreed, we as the European Union, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=58.28s)]
*  the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, to start with a package of robust [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=64.64s)]
*  sanctions that we will deliver today here in the European Union and our friends too. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=70.48s)]
*  I'm going to get to those precise sanctions in a moment, but can you explain to me why [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=77.92s)]
*  you don't call it an invasion or a reinvasion? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=81.44s)]
*  There are troops and military hardware that have crossed a border from one country into [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=84.36s)]
*  another. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=89.16s)]
*  So, what we see is that Donetsk and Luhansk has been occupied since almost eight years [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=90.16s)]
*  now, and for us it's important that we closely watch the actions of Russia, and we respond [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=96.64s)]
*  to the actions of Russia. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=105.4s)]
*  Russia is responsible for this crisis. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=107.08s)]
*  Russia is responsible for the escalation, and therefore our sanctions package, the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=110.48s)]
*  first one we are delivering now, is well calibrated, but we are also very clear if there's any [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=115.56s)]
*  further military action against Ukraine that we see there will be a massive and robust [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=121.84s)]
*  second package that is coming. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=128.26s)]
*  It is well prepared. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=130.4s)]
*  Since weeks we have been working on it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=132.12s)]
*  It is an unprecedented cooperation with the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=134.4s)]
*  and us, and this is very clear that Russia will have to pay a price, and it is President [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=140.6s)]
*  Putin who will have to explain to his people why he is putting this enormous price on them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJFP9JP-2uE&t=149.12s)]
