# Trumpâ€™s Deputy National Security Advisor on U.S.-China Relations  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g)
*  Next, we turn to Taiwan, where people voted for a historic third term for the Democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=0.0s)]
*  Progressive Party. President-elect Lai Chi-kai won more than 40 percent. So what does it [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=5.44s)]
*  mean for relations with mainland China and diplomacy with other nations like the United [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=11.3s)]
*  States? Matt Pottinger is a former U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor, and he's joining [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=16.56s)]
*  Walter Isaacson to discuss this now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=21.96s)]
*  Thank you, Christian and Matt Pottinger. Welcome back to the show. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=25.3s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Walter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  So we had these elections in Taiwan, somewhat of a unnerving surprise if you're worried [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  about our relationships with China, very much of a government that will try to keep its [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=37.6s)]
*  democratic independence from China. Tell us how to assess it and what happened there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well, what you had was the democratic expression of the society. That's one of the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=49.26s)]
*  most successful democracies in the world. People showed up in huge numbers, percentages [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=56.18s)]
*  of turnout that should really be the envy of the democratic world. And what people decided [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=63.66s)]
*  to do was something unusual. This is the first time that a party has been returned for, in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=70.7s)]
*  essence, a third term of office after it had really been in sort of eight year cycles [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=76.98s)]
*  that the opposition would switch with the ruling party. But I think what you're seeing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=85.9s)]
*  is in part the opposition vote was split between a couple of candidates, which helped boost [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=92.42s)]
*  Vice President Lai to the presidency, but he still obtained 40 plus percent of the vote. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=100.98s)]
*  The president-elect has said that this was an expression of democracy over authoritarianism, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  the great struggle in this world today. Do you think he's going to be able to get along [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=114.5s)]
*  with China or is that going to provoke China to try to assert more control over Taiwan? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=120.30000000000001s)]
*  Look, the truth is if Beijing had played things differently, and they still have the opportunity [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=126.5s)]
*  to play things differently, they probably could have had a somewhat productive relationship with [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=131.94s)]
*  the current outgoing president, President Tsai Ing-wen. When President Tsai was elected eight [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  years ago, she went out of her way to, in some sense, buck her party platform in order to extend [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=146.78s)]
*  an olive branch to Beijing. She made clear, she did several of the things that Beijing would have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=155.14s)]
*  wanted to hear, but Beijing decided rather than to build on that and start a dialogue with her [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=164.26s)]
*  government, they froze her out. And for eight years, they have not actually engaged in any kind [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=172.33999999999997s)]
*  of productive dialogue, barely any dialogue at all, other than perhaps a little bit of back channel [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  diplomacy. And so here we are again, Beijing's preferred candidates did not win for a third [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=185.38s)]
*  time in a row. Beijing could actually open a dialogue. And my guess would be that Vice [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=194.82s)]
*  President Lai, now President-elect Lai, would be willing to entertain the idea of some kind of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=202.5s)]
*  dialogue. I just don't think Beijing's going to offer it. Beijing is more interested in control [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=211.38s)]
*  than in dialogue. And so unfortunately, I think that Beijing is going to miss [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=216.98s)]
*  yet another opportunity here. And to what extent do you think that this could lead to a military [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=224.18s)]
*  confrontation over Taiwan? And what would the timetable be? Does this speed up that timetable? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=230.82s)]
*  So Xi Jinping has made clear that he's impatient. He doesn't talk the way that his predecessors did [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=236.26s)]
*  about there being time, so long as Taiwan doesn't declare formal independence, that time is on Beijing's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=244.17999999999998s)]
*  side. That's not how Xi Jinping sees it. But the other thing is that Xi Jinping has really [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=251.22s)]
*  changed the game. A lot of his predecessors' rhetoric about Taiwan was designed to restrain [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  Taiwan, to ensure that Taiwan did not declare independence. Xi Jinping is not trying to maintain [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=263.7s)]
*  the status quo the way that the rhetoric might have suggested by some of his predecessors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  Instead, what he's trying to do is compel Taiwan to move toward unification under the People's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=276.26s)]
*  Republic of China. And that is not something that the vast majority of people in Taiwan want to see. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=286.18s)]
*  If China right now decided to blockade Taiwan or decided to move on it in a military way, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=293.3s)]
*  what do you think the U.S. should do? And does the U.S. have the capacity right now to fight a war? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, the lesson from Ukraine is that deterrence would have been a whole lot cheaper [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=307.86s)]
*  than war. So let's succeed at deterrence. We can do that. We know how to deter. We did it during [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=312.18s)]
*  the Cold War. It's why the Cold War stayed cold. But we were spending twice as much, Walter, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=318.26s)]
*  in the 1980s under Reagan as a percentage of GDP on defense as we're spending right now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=324.74s)]
*  This is a mistake. This is a mistake. We need to be showing that we have decisive capabilities, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=331.38s)]
*  conventional capabilities, that in fact we already have the technology and the platforms to deliver. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  It's just that we haven't been building enough of these anti-ship missiles. We haven't been making [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=344.02s)]
*  sure that our attack submarines are cycling out of port and maintenance quickly enough to be a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=347.7s)]
*  real problem for Beijing. Let's focus on that. Look, if Beijing ends up pulling the trigger, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=356.5s)]
*  it makes that fateful decision that Vladimir Putin has made. I actually believe that President Biden [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=362.98s)]
*  has been pretty clear. I don't think he was speaking off the cuff. You might be able to say [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=370.5s)]
*  that he was speaking off the cuff once or twice, but President Biden has now said four times, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=375.78s)]
*  quite deliberately, that he would back Taiwan militarily in order to prevent what he called [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=380.82s)]
*  an unprecedented military attack on Taiwan. I think we should take the president at his word. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  WOLFF Well, the president said that, and that goes against what was official, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=395.94s)]
*  I think, U.S. policy, which is sort of a strategic ambiguity. We don't quite say [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=401.62s)]
*  outright that we would get involved militarily if there were an attack by China on Taiwan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=408.42s)]
*  Should we change U.S. policy and make it unambiguous that we give defense protection to Taiwan? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=414.74s)]
*  BUSH You know, I would argue that President Biden already has made that shift. It is not the staff [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=421.94s)]
*  of the president, but the president under Article 2 of our Constitution who makes our foreign policy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=430.02s)]
*  I think we should take President Biden literally, take him at his word, and that in essence, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=435.46s)]
*  he has already removed at least a lot of that fog of ambiguity from the policy. I think it would be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=442.34s)]
*  unwise for any other presidential candidate to back away from the position that President Biden [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=449.06s)]
*  has staked on this, and I think that that will actually help keep the peace. Wars begin with [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=456.66s)]
*  optimism. It's one of the things that we often overlook or forget, because it sounds counterintuitive, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=466.58000000000004s)]
*  but if you look at the beginnings of wars throughout history, whether they were launched by [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=474.02000000000004s)]
*  a democracy like the United States or by dictatorships, it often starts with this [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=479.38s)]
*  idea, this kernel of optimism that, my goodness, I think that through war we can achieve things [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=487.54s)]
*  that we couldn't achieve through diplomacy, A, and B, I think the war will go really well for us. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=493.14000000000004s)]
*  This is a miscalculation that all sorts of governments make, including our own, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=498.98s)]
*  has believed that wars will be short and decisive when, in fact, they turn out to be murky, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=504.97999999999996s)]
*  incredibly costly, and long. The troops don't come home by Christmas the way that leaders often [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=510.26s)]
*  promise. So you are an advisor to President Trump, you're on the National Security Council. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=518.9s)]
*  What is his view, do you think, and what should it be? What would it be on this notion of being [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=523.86s)]
*  unequivocal that if China goes after Taiwan militarily, we will defend Taiwan militarily? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=530.02s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, I can speak for what the policy was during President Trump's last term in office. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=538.8199999999999s)]
*  I think that over the course of his time in office, he came to appreciate how problematic [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=548.1s)]
*  a crisis in the Taiwan Strait would be for the U.S., for our economic prosperity, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=556.26s)]
*  for our alliances with Japan and South Korea and the Philippines and Australia and others. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=561.46s)]
*  So he was careful to not say exactly what he would do. I remember him actually saying, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=568.1s)]
*  look, I'm not going to say exactly what I'm going to do, but Xi Jinping needs to understand that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=580.18s)]
*  this would be a pretty serious matter. So in essence, I think President Trump was [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=588.5799999999999s)]
*  sustaining that tried and true policy of, as you called it, strategic ambiguity. I think that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=594.26s)]
*  President Biden has now moved the needle to something that is more than ambiguous. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=602.26s)]
*  Less ambiguous. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=608.7399999999999s)]
*  It is less ambiguous in essence. So I don't know what President Trump's policy would be in a second [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  term, but I think it would be a miscalculation on Xi Jinping's part to test any U.S. president. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=618.66s)]
*  Let me ask you something personally. I mean, you work with Trump both on that and on COVID as it [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=627.94s)]
*  came out of, you know, across from China to the U.S. And I've read a lot of the things you've said [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=633.7s)]
*  and you too have a bit of ambiguity now in your feelings about the Trump administration. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=643.0600000000001s)]
*  So many people you worked with, like Defense Secretary Esper and others, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=649.46s)]
*  has said he would be dangerous now. Tell me what your thoughts are about looking at the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=654.02s)]
*  possibility of a second Trump term. I don't want to predict how this is all going to turn out. What [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=661.06s)]
*  I will say is that any president who indulges isolationism, any president who doesn't have the [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=665.78s)]
*  back of American allies, whether they are in the Western Pacific, like South Korea and Japan and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=679.14s)]
*  the Philippines, or whether they're in Europe, our incredible alliance structure with NATO, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=686.7399999999999s)]
*  it's the most successful multilateral alliance probably in history, any president who does not [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  have the back of those alliances and institutions will be [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=700.9s)]
*  welcomed in essence by America's adversaries because America's adversaries view those alliances [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=708.98s)]
*  as the primary obstacle to them achieving their aggression, you know, their aggressive expansionist, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=716.74s)]
*  revanchist ambitions. So President Trump in his first term, I think, did maintain the strength [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=723.46s)]
*  of those alliances. He put a lot of fear into our allies, particularly in Europe, where they were [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=732.02s)]
*  afraid that the United States would back away. But in the end, those allies stepped up, spent more [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=740.82s)]
*  money and President Trump reaffirmed those alliances. I very much hope that that would be [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=746.1s)]
*  his policy in a second term if in fact he's elected come November. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=752.02s)]
*  Well, wait a minute. I mean, he has not been supportive of either Ukraine or NATO [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=757.9399999999999s)]
*  in this current situation, this current invasion by Russia into Ukraine. And I think I'm hearing [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=763.38s)]
*  you say that that really worries you, but you're parsing it a bit too carefully there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh, look, I don't think we should turn our back on Ukraine because [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=775.62s)]
*  the cost of Ukraine falling is going to be radically higher than the cost of us [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=780.1s)]
*  supporting brave Ukrainians to fight a war for their national survival. If Ukraine falls, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=786.5s)]
*  the cost to NATO of even just continuing to deter Russia from going further is going to be [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=795.78s)]
*  dramatically greater than the relatively small. I'm sorry, but it is in real terms [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=803.0600000000001s)]
*  a pretty small investment. We're not putting American lives at risk. We're not shedding [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=810.74s)]
*  American blood. We're helping brave Ukrainians defend their country so that we don't end up with [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=815.14s)]
*  Russia threatening our NATO allies and pushing us to the brink of a third world war. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=822.1800000000001s)]
*  I think it would be unwise to turn our backs. Europe has to do a lot better. President Trump, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=828.5s)]
*  I give credit, particularly in his first term, to basically pointing out how Europeans support [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=833.9399999999999s)]
*  for their own alliance structure has fallen short. I think that there's an opportunity [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=840.26s)]
*  to get the Europeans to do more for their own defense. But at the end of the day, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=848.9s)]
*  he did still stick with that alliance structure. Don't you worry about the rising isolationism? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=854.02s)]
*  There's a rising isolationism on the populist right of the Republican Party. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=860.9799999999999s)]
*  I agree with you. It reminds me of the 1930s. The isolationism is not limited to a sizable chunk of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=868.9s)]
*  the Republican Party. There's a different brand of it that has sort of sneaked up on us in the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=877.62s)]
*  Democratic Party as well. It has different motivations and it has different expressions. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=884.34s)]
*  But nonetheless, we're in a very 1930s moment right now, Walter, where, as I've been reading [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=889.7s)]
*  a lot of 1930s history over the course of the last several months, I've been struck by the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=895.22s)]
*  similarities. I'm hopeful that we learn the lessons, remember the lessons that we learned [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=902.9s)]
*  in blood that had to be written in blood in the 20th century so that we don't fall into the trap [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=908.26s)]
*  of isolationism, believing that the two oceans are going to keep us safe from the sorts of [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=913.6999999999999s)]
*  dynamics that we're seeing play out in Europe or in the Middle East, or if we really play our [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=920.74s)]
*  cards badly in the Western Pacific as well. The Chinese foreign minister has been talking about [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=926.1s)]
*  trying to help negotiate the Palestinian, the Hamas-Israel situation. We've spent a lot of time [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=933.38s)]
*  over the past 60 years trying to establish the U.S. as a primary player in the Middle East. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=941.06s)]
*  Do you think it's a good idea for us to want or to allow China to be involved in the Middle East [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=946.98s)]
*  and to try to sort this out? Is that in our interests? Well, look, I think that we have to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=952.8199999999999s)]
*  The question almost answers itself when you consider the fact that Beijing has been one of the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=959.38s)]
*  agitators that has inflamed the problems that we're dealing with in the Middle East right now. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=965.9399999999999s)]
*  Beijing is the chief propaganda and diplomatic supporter for Russia. Russia has provided [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=972.42s)]
*  a lot of diplomatic and possibly material support for Hamas. Remember, right after the massacre of [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=979.4599999999999s)]
*  innocent Israelis on the 7th of October, Vladimir Putin's government hosted a trilateral meeting in [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=985.94s)]
*  Moscow between the leaders of Hamas and leaders of Iran. Beijing has provided [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=992.34s)]
*  propaganda support for Hamas through platforms like the Chinese Communist Party-controlled TikTok [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1000.5s)]
*  platform. We've seen Beijing standing up for, you know, basically undermining Israel and its [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1008.18s)]
*  need for security. Even Israel's borders have been erased from Chinese websites like [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1021.38s)]
*  Alibaba.com and Baidu.com. So Beijing is an agitator here. It is not interested [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1027.54s)]
*  in maintaining stability. If you read the speeches of Xi Jinping, he talks quite a lot [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1035.94s)]
*  about chaos. He said in a speech in 2021, chaos is the defining word for our era. And then he [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1042.5800000000002s)]
*  went on in that speech to make clear that he thought that was something advantageous to China [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1050.8200000000002s)]
*  and its ambitions, that chaos was something bad for Western democracies. And as he said, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1055.94s)]
*  the West is fading and the East is rising. China's authoritarian agenda. So I don't think that China's [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1063.46s)]
*  really interested in being a constructive partner with us in the Middle East or pretty much any [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1071.78s)]
*  other part of the world. Matt Pottinger, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Walter. Thanks for having me. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1076.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEgdrerKW4g&t=1093.22s)]
