# What is Putin’s Endgame? Garry Kasparov on Russia’s Attack on Ukraine  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [February 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c)
*  Now chess, of course, is a game of rules, but Putin is demonstrating that he follows no one's rules but his own. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=0.0s)]
*  A vocal critic is Garry Kasparov, a Russian chess grandmaster, who ranked world number one repeatedly for 20 years, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=6.0s)]
*  until turning his attention to politics and once attempting to run for president in Russia. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=13.0s)]
*  He's now telling leaders to, quote, help Ukraine fight against the monster you have helped create. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=18.0s)]
*  As we said, around a thousand people have been detained in anti-war protests across Russia. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=25.0s)]
*  As Putin cracks down on demonstrators, Kasparov sat down with Walter Isaacson. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=31.0s)]
*  Thank you, Kristjan and Garry Kasparov. Welcome to the show. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=37.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=41.0s)]
*  You know, unfortunately, you turned out to be right. As Russia's most famous chess master, you led the Democratic opposition to Vladimir Putin, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=43.0s)]
*  and in 2015 you wrote a book called Winter is Coming, and its subtitle was [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=53.0s)]
*  How Vladimir Putin and His Enemies of Free World Must Be Stopped. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=59.0s)]
*  Now that we see what he's doing, what should our response be? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=65.0s)]
*  As a professional chess player, I always wanted to analyze my mistakes if I lost the game and something went wrong before making my next move. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=72.0s)]
*  And working on the strategy. I think it's important to recognize that Vladimir Putin has been preparing this war for many years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=82.0s)]
*  And unlike 1939, because many parallels have been made with the late 30s of the 20th century, this war has been preparing, has been prepared in the plain sight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=92.0s)]
*  And I think one of the problems today is that, and when we call Putin's decision irrational, is that he didn't think it was irrational because for so many years, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=104.0s)]
*  for two decades, he saw no consequences for his actions, actually for his crimes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=115.0s)]
*  And I think now it's time to actually impose the price for what has been done, because it is the only way to prevent him from moving even further. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=121.0s)]
*  I believe that the free world still has resources to stop Putin at this point, because what we know from history, from the 20th century and also from Vladimir Putin's recent history, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=131.0s)]
*  that every day of delay of our response to a brutal dictator simply is pushing the price to pay for his actions higher and higher. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=148.0s)]
*  You say we can impose a price, and you say that price could slow him down or stop him. What is that price? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=160.0s)]
*  And as somebody who's lived in Russia, how could you do the most effective thing to stop him? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=167.0s)]
*  I've been saying all along that it's not about tanks, it's about banks. Of course, now Ukraine needs tanks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=173.0s)]
*  And it's tragic that Ukraine is not meeting Putin's aggression with sufficient military equipment that could have been supplied to Ukraine ages ago. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=179.0s)]
*  But right now it's about Putin's military machine that has been supported by hundreds of billions of dollars of cash that came from the free world, cut it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=189.0s)]
*  So there's still many options to limit or even stop effective Putin's military machine that needs, every day, every minute, needs money. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=201.0s)]
*  And Putin has been allocating this cash. He's sitting on a pile of cash, hundreds of billions of dollars, but it may evaporate if the free world cut the supply. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=218.0s)]
*  I know that all these sanctions will be very painful for the free world. I mean, no doubt that, again, the price that the free world will pay to stop Putin's aggression is climbing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=229.0s)]
*  And it's not that we can do something to help Ukraine without paying for the consequences here in the free world, but there's no other choice. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=240.0s)]
*  So I think cut Russia from energy sector, Russian gas and oil export, and also immediately cut Russia from all financial markets. Those are first two moves that are so natural. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=251.0s)]
*  Will that help him at home or will that hurt him at home? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=266.0s)]
*  Let's stop this nonsense. Putin is an absolute dictator. He doesn't care about public opinion. He doesn't care about free press. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=270.0s)]
*  So it's one man and his gang that are making all the decisions. And you have to hurt them where it hurts. And of course, they keep their money abroad. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=280.0s)]
*  They're also hundreds of billions of dollars. Some people say probably already one or two trillion dollars in assets that spread around the world. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=290.0s)]
*  Start looking for them, seizing them, confiscating them. This is the money that we need to pay for the consequences of this war and also for helping Ukraine. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=300.0s)]
*  Also immediately recall ambassadors. It's just to demonstrate that it's a war. I mean, show Putin and most important to people who are around him that there's a price to pay and also Russia will be totally isolated. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=310.0s)]
*  Okay, China is there, but I don't think China is going to compensate Putin for his losses because everything China wants now is to see the Western response to this aggression since China has been contemplating this similar move against Taiwan. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=322.0s)]
*  In your book, your 2015 book, Winter is Coming, you say that Putin is at the center of a worldwide assault on political liberty. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=338.0s)]
*  Do you think that that's his goal to stop political liberty or is he mainly just worried about a military alliance that's against him, NATO, being on his borders and in the heart of what used to be the Soviet sphere? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=350.0s)]
*  I think Putin has his own ideology and he was quite blunt telling about it when he was rising in Russian politics, even before he became president of Russia. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=364.0s)]
*  So he talked about the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=381.0s)]
*  He also talked about a KGB, once KGB, always KGB, no former KGB officers. And year after year, he has been talking about Ukraine as a failed state. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=387.0s)]
*  He never recognized Ukraine as a sovereign state. It's not me saying it's Vladimir Putin year after year. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=400.0s)]
*  And I think if we want to understand Putin's philosophy, if you may call it philosophy, we should simply read again his speech 15 years ago in February 2007 in Munich at the Security Conference in Europe when he talked about return to the spheres of influence. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=406.0s)]
*  Basically, you know, just, you know, sending the message that he disagreed with the world security infrastructure built after World War II. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=421.0s)]
*  And let's give him credit. So he has been very consistent in pushing this agenda, attacking Republic of Georgia in 2008, propping up Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria and carpet bombing civilian targets across Syria, annexing Crimea. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=430.0s)]
*  It's a long list. And I think, you know, just on the bottom of that is Putin's belief that dictators, they are entitled to do whatever they want in their own countries, but also they can use force as the main argument in international relations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=447.0s)]
*  Putin's attack on Ukraine is not attack on Ukraine only. It's attack on the world security infrastructure because he thinks it's standing on the way of him or other fellow dictators to rule the world the way they want. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=463.0s)]
*  You were world chess champion when you turned 22 in Russia, and you've written a book that I love, which was called Life Imitates Chess. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=477.0s)]
*  And you start by saying, how do you evaluate opportunities is one of the lessons. How did he evaluate opportunities and how did we misplay that so that he thought he had opportunities? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=487.0s)]
*  I think he has reached a point, as every dictator did in the past, where it's not about calculating rationally from our perspective. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=500.0s)]
*  Dictators never ask why it's always why not. And after so many years of paying no price for his actions, he believes now that he can get away with that because the free world showed nothing but weakness. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=509.0s)]
*  He's quite cynical and the fact is that he succeeded in buying Western politicians of a highest caliber like Gerhard Schröder and many others. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=524.0s)]
*  So prove to him that it's all about price to pay. He doesn't believe in NATO solidarity. He saw nothing but weakness in America over the last decade. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=536.0s)]
*  And he thinks that the free world is divided, badly divided. And the way he reads the latest news from the international stage is he sees the rise of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes and the steady weakening of democracy. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=546.0s)]
*  For him, it's a historic revenge. So he thinks that, you know, the world should be run by big, big guys and the smaller countries should simply abide. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=562.0s)]
*  What do you think of the responses of previous American leaders, whether it be President Obama when the Crimean Peninsula was invaded or President Trump, who seemed to be on a friendlier course with Putin? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=571.0s)]
*  It's like a pendulum shifting from feckless to reckless. Obama ignored this threat and there were many, many defining moments during his years that convinced Putin that America could only talk. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=585.0s)]
*  And one of them, of course, was the infamous red line in Syria. So that was really bad. And I predicted that the consequences of Obama not keeping his word and ruining Assad's regime after the use of chemical weapons, it will resonate around the world. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=604.0s)]
*  And of course, the annexation of Crimea was another test that the free world failed. And then of course, Trump. I mean, Donald Trump was a gift to Putin. And I believe no matter what is being decided by numerous commissions and investigation in America, I believe that Russia was behind this Trump's beat and Putin did absolutely everything to secure Trump's elections in 2016 and tried to help him in 2020. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=628.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump, for some reasons, adored Putin and obviously though was not ready to boost NATO solidarity. So Trump's policies weakened European solidarity and American solidarity even further. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=655.0s)]
*  What about Republicans now, Republican leaders now that seem to be siding almost with Putin or understanding what he's doing this rift in the Republican Party? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=674.0s)]
*  I think it's the Republican Party now should work is with cognitive dissonance. It's kind of schizophrenia. When you just look at the news, let's say Fox News.com, and one side you have Tucker Carlson, and he's acolytes, and then you had some of the traditional Republicans. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=686.0s)]
*  And by this by the administration is being blamed for being too weak on Putin or being too harsh. So it just shows that the party now is just is so badly divided between those who still believe in America's leadership and those who are just you know, who are Trumpists. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=702.0s)]
*  So who would like you know America to withdraw. By the way, that's not surprising. In 1939, 1940, there were many Republicans at the time that wanted America to stay isolated and not to be involved because they had, oh, directly or indirectly, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=721.0s)]
*  to add to Hitler's actions in Europe. So again, the history repeats itself. And it's again, it's quite tragic that one of the most popular TV channels in America is now is the home for what I see is bluntly un-American propaganda that is making Putin's bidding. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=741.0s)]
*  And it's not surprising that these statements, mainly from Tucker Carlson, they are just being regularly presented on Russian television. So it's, and again, unfortunately, that's not only American problem. It's across Europe. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=761.0s)]
*  We also saw many people, mostly from the far right, but also from far left, that were quite comfortable of supporting Putin's security proposals. Now they probably are silent, but still, you know, we heard even from Donald Trump himself, you know, calling Putin's recent decisions genius. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=775.0s)]
*  You compared just now the sort of pro-sympathetic Putin types in the United States, including some Republican senators, to the 1939 appeasers who felt some sympathy for what was going on in Germany. They were called, they called themselves America-fursters. That's where the title came. Now the same people are using the phrase America first. What do you think of that? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=795.0s)]
*  It's a, I think it could be more obvious that there's a parallel, because it's not just about the name. It's about the principle. They have their doubts about democracy, though they believe in authoritarianism as a way to solve problems. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=823.0s)]
*  And that's why they show emphasis to Nazis in Germany in the late 30s, early 40s. And now they have been, they are not shy demonstrating their emphasis to Putin and his criminal regime. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=845.0s)]
*  As a Russian chess master, how do you assess what his endgame could be? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=861.0s)]
*  I believe that the endgame will be the same as before. Dictators will lose. It's not about the outcome. It's about the price we'll pay, the price Ukrainians will pay, and maybe other nations, and of course the free world. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=869.0s)]
*  Because we're now seeing the end of the world that we used to live in. It's not the world that knows how to stop at the red line and not to cross it, like in 1962. So we are, we already passed this station. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=884.0s)]
*  And we need to consider how we're going to move forward, because United Nations now is paralyzed. It's this institution proved to be totally incapable of addressing the issues that became paramount in the modern world. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=903.0s)]
*  So I think Putin regime will collapse. But again, it's like a little bit of agony of a dinosaur. And the agony of a dinosaur could be very damaging for those who are nearby. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=920.0s)]
*  And again, it depends on our resolute actions now, whether the price will keep coming up or we can limit it at this horrendous cost today. But it's still probably doable to keep it within limits of preventing the war to spread out across Europe. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=933.0s)]
*  And also around the world, because again, Putin's success in Ukraine, even partial success, could embolden China to attack Taiwan. And then again, then America will be facing much steeper dilemma about interfering or not, because Chinese invasion of Taiwan could disrupt the world order even on a bigger scale. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=962.0s)]
*  Gary Kasparov, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYhsloRid_c&t=989.0s)]
