# Blinken and Amanpour Discuss Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Release Deal  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco)
*  A cease-fire hostage release agreement has been reached by the Israeli government and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas, a senior U.S. official confirms to me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=4.96s)]
*  Now, this deal has been a long time coming for hostage families in Israel and for Palestinians [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=8.08s)]
*  in Gaza who have been under an endless assault for more than a year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I spoke about this breakthrough in an exclusive interview with U.S. Secretary of State Antony [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=18.32s)]
*  Blinken. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=23.12s)]
*  I started by asking him what exactly the cease-fire means, and we spoke just as it was being announced. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=24.12s)]
*  First, the firing stops. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=30.0s)]
*  Hamas, Israel, stop firing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=33.4s)]
*  Israel pulls back its forces. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=35.8s)]
*  Hostages begin to be released. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=37.8s)]
*  Prisoners come out of Israeli jails and go back, and we surge humanitarian assistance [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=40.0s)]
*  to people who so desperately need it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=45.44s)]
*  All of that happens during a six-week period. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=47.92s)]
*  But also during that six weeks, we have to negotiate the understandings to get to a permanency [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=50.24s)]
*  so that Israel pulls all of its forces out of Gaza, Hamas doesn't come back in, and there's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=57.6s)]
*  the necessary governance, security, reconstruction arrangements so that Gaza can move forward. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=62.6s)]
*  Is that sorted? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=68.6s)]
*  That's not sorted. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=69.6s)]
*  We've worked on it intensely for the last six or seven months, intensely but quietly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=70.6s)]
*  with Arab partners, with others. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=75.76s)]
*  I think there's some basic understandings that we've reached, but the cease-fire itself, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=77.48s)]
*  hopefully, would concentrate minds and get people to agree on what's necessary to get [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  that day after a post-conflict plan in place. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=86.48s)]
*  So we're speaking as your successor is undergoing confirmation hearings, Senator Marco Rubio. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=90.04s)]
*  Do you think that the Trump administration will take your ball and roll with it down [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=96.08s)]
*  the line, or could they say, hey, nice try, guys, but we don't care? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Of course, it will be up to them, but not only up to them, it will be up to the parties [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  and all the people concerned. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=109.04s)]
*  I think there's a strong impetus among all involved, not only to have this cease-fire [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=110.64s)]
*  that hopefully will achieve in the coming hours or certainly days, but to make sure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=117.2s)]
*  that it's permanent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=121.44s)]
*  Israel does not have an incentive to remain bogged down in Gaza with an insurgency, bleeding [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=122.44s)]
*  it, continuing to put pressure on its economy, on its reserves. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=128.84s)]
*  The Palestinian people certainly don't need a continuation of Gaza. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  Countries throughout the region don't want that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  I think there's going to be, assuming the cease-fire is reached, strong, strong pressure [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  from all sides to make sure that it becomes permanent. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=146.84s)]
*  The best way to do that, I think, is through the work that we've done, but it'll be up [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=150.56s)]
*  to the administration to decide whether to try to carry that forward, whether it has [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=154.12s)]
*  some other way of doing this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=157.84s)]
*  The most important thing, though, is get the cease-fire, make it permanent. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't know whether you agree, but many analysts are saying that actually Trump's rival has [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=164.24s)]
*  jumpedstarted this and has focused people's minds and at least got this cease-fire to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=168.96s)]
*  be serious. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=172.4s)]
*  As you say, it's something that the president planned back in May and et cetera. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=173.4s)]
*  There are people like a very prominent Israeli hostage negotiator who says, this is not a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  great deal, this interim one. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=187.48s)]
*  It's only about 30 hostages. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=189.84s)]
*  Many, many have died in the interim since May that it could have been done much earlier. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=192.16s)]
*  I know you often, USG blames Hamas for its role in delaying, but I don't know whether [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=198.28s)]
*  you saw what Itzmar Ben-Gavir said to the Times of Israel just over the last couple [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=203.84s)]
*  of days. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=208.32s)]
*  He basically said that me and Smotrich have successfully prevented any cease-fire deals [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=209.88s)]
*  for the last year and we still want to prevent this one. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=215.68s)]
*  How do you react to that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=220.34s)]
*  Are you willing to agree that also Israel has held up what could have been the Biden [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=221.48s)]
*  cease-fire, which could have saved many lives many, many months ago? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=226.44s)]
*  Should this have happened months ago? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=231.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=234.44s)]
*  Could it have happened months ago? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=235.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=237.44s)]
*  Were there occasions when each side did things that made it more difficult to get this over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=238.44s)]
*  the finish line? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=243.4s)]
*  Yes, including Israel, but predominantly it's been Hamas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=244.4s)]
*  Certainly in the last few months, Hamas had refused to engage. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=249.76s)]
*  We finally got it to re-engage. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=254.44s)]
*  And in these last weeks in particular, Hamas has been the party that's held back on finally [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=257.12s)]
*  getting to yes, but we've managed to push to a point where as I said, we're on the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=263.32s)]
*  brink. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=267.84s)]
*  Look, I think what the basic dynamic has been this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=268.84s)]
*  First, what was so important was that there had to be an agreement that this would proceed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=272.24s)]
*  in two phases, that we'd have these six weeks where everyone stops firing, Israel pulls [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=277.4s)]
*  back, hostages come out, prisoners are released, humanitarian assistance goes in, and final [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=281.8s)]
*  arrangements for an enduring cease-fire are made. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=287.84s)]
*  For months, Hamas wouldn't accept that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=291.84s)]
*  The president went forward, went public in May, very end of May, early June, with a detailed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=293.56s)]
*  proposal for that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=298.7s)]
*  And then we went around the world and everyone came out in support of it, including the UN [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=300.1s)]
*  Security Council. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=303.88s)]
*  And at that point, Hamas was isolated and it signed onto that framework. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=304.96s)]
*  Ever since, as I said, we've been working to implement it, to get the final arrangements. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  But there have been two dynamics that have really, I think, held things back more than [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=313.22s)]
*  anything else. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=316.44000000000005s)]
*  One, Hamas was hoping, hoping, hoping that the cavalry would come to the rescue, that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=317.44000000000005s)]
*  it would get a wider war with Lebanon and Hezbollah, with Iran. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=321.72s)]
*  And the actions that we took along with Israel made it clear that the cavalry was not coming [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=325.72s)]
*  to the rescue. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=330.92s)]
*  It couldn't count on that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=331.92s)]
*  Second, it hoped that by holding back, pressure would just mount on Israel to give in and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=332.92s)]
*  to accede to the terms of a ceasefire hostage deal on Hamas's terms. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=338.04s)]
*  And there again, that hasn't happened. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think as we look at it, as we've seen it, yes, have there been moments when things [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=344.98s)]
*  have happened on one side or the other that have made it harder to get it over the line? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=350.0s)]
*  Yes, but fundamentally, it's been Hamas. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  But now we're at the point where hopefully Hamas sees that the only way forward is through [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=356.88s)]
*  the ceasefire. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bceWovEjKco&t=363.12s)]
