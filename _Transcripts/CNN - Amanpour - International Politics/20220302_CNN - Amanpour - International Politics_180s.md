Video Description: In Ukraine the rule is: Stand and fight -- in defense of democracy and sovereignty. Overwhelmingly superior Russian forces have so far been unable to predominate in the sky or on the battlefield. Now Moscow turns to a gruesome alternative: forcing a surrender by targeting civilian infrastructure and ordinary people. On the diplomatic front, Russia's heavyweight ally China got off the fence and expressed concern with the killing of civilians, offering to play the role of peacemaker. At the United Nations today, member states voted 141 to 5 to condemn Putin's invasion. Barbara Woodward is the UK's ambassador to the U.N., having previously served as ambassador to China. She joins the program from the United Nations.

# Woodward on the UN's "Historic" Vote to Condemn Russia's Invasion of Ukraine | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg)
*  And at the United Nations today, nations voted 141 to 5 to condemn Putin's invasion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=0.0s)]
*  The five against were Russia, Belarus, Syria, Eritrea, and North Korea. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=7.48s)]
*  35 countries abstained. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=14.48s)]
*  Barbara Woodward is the British ambassador to the U.N. and before that she was ambassador [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=16.84s)]
*  to China and she's joining me now from headquarters in New York. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=21.26s)]
*  Welcome ambassador to the program. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=24.96s)]
*  Let me start by just stating that this is only the 11th such emergency General Assembly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=27.44s)]
*  session since the creation of the U.N., the last one being in 1997. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=32.58s)]
*  How loud a signal was the vote today? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=39.36s)]
*  What do you expect it to achieve? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, good evening, Christiane, and I've just come up from a packed General Assembly chamber. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=44.32s)]
*  It was a historic vote this evening, as you say, for two reasons. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  The first, we haven't had a vote like this in 40 years here at the U.N., an emergency [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  special session of the General Assembly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=60.66s)]
*  And secondly, for the magnitude of the numbers, as you said, 141 votes in favor, so that's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=63.4s)]
*  nearly three quarters of the General Assembly standing up to condemn Russia's invasion of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=70.44s)]
*  Ukraine, deplore Belarus's involvement in that invasion, and demand that Russian boots [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=76.72s)]
*  get off the ground and the territory of Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=83.84s)]
*  Do you think that it will it's obviously nonbinding, as you said, what actually really can be done [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=88.06s)]
*  at the U.N.? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=93.28s)]
*  It is a signal, certainly to Russia, which likes to, you know, often likes to sort of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=94.28s)]
*  wrap itself up in international legitimacy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=98.5s)]
*  What actually will it mean in in the real world? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=101.86s)]
*  I think in the real world, Christiane, first of all, it shows Russia just how isolated [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=106.08s)]
*  they are internationally in the company of only four other countries out of a totality [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=111.3s)]
*  of the U.N. membership. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=117.32s)]
*  And the second thing it does, it reinforces everything that we have been doing on the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  economic sanctions front in support to Ukraine, humanitarian aid. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=124.62s)]
*  All countries are saying they are behind this and they recognize the threat when a permanent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=129.82s)]
*  member of the United Nations in an unprovoked and premeditated way invades another smaller [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=136.74s)]
*  country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  And that's right at the heart of what the U.N. is about. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  We had a very moving speech from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the smallest country ever [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=147.02s)]
*  to sit on the Security Council, saying it's the principle of our national boundaries that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  we are entitled to see observed and protected at the U.N. that has been violated by Russia [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  in respect to Ukraine. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHs1SjRB6sg&t=163.48000000000002s)]
