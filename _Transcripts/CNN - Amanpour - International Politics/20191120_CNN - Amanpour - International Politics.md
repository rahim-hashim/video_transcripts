*  offers a cautionary tale [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=2.1s)]
*  on the corrosive effects of corruption. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=3.7s)]
*  Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=6.04s)]
*  is known for her collection of shoes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=9.08s)]
*  and her lavish lifestyle, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=11.44s)]
*  and for the ruthless dictatorship [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  that she and her late husband ruled for two decades, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=14.92s)]
*  getting massively rich themselves in the process. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=18.26s)]
*  Film director Lauren Greenfield [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=21.02s)]
*  has teamed up with the former investigator [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=22.76s)]
*  of the Marcos family, Andy Bautista, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=24.82s)]
*  to make The Kingmaker, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=27.3s)]
*  a stunning documentary about the larger-than-life Imelda Marcos. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=28.900000000000002s)]
*  And they sat down with Alison Stewart [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=32.9s)]
*  to discuss the power of perception over truth. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=35.0s)]
*  Lauren Greenfield and Andy Bautista, welcome. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=39.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=41.94s)]
*  Lauren, why did you call the film The Kingmaker? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=42.94s)]
*  I called it The Kingmaker [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=45.68s)]
*  because I saw Imelda as a kingmaker. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=47.32s)]
*  I read a definition that said a kingmaker [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  is somebody who has a critical impact on political succession [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=52.92s)]
*  without being a viable candidate themselves. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=57.72s)]
*  And that, to me, was Imelda. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=60.46s)]
*  She was crucial in coming to the presidency of her husband, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  the President Ferdinand Marcos, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=65.92s)]
*  and then she was the person helping her son, the prince, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=67.9s)]
*  hopefully get back to the palace. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=73.34s)]
*  And then she played a key role in this alliance with Duterte [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=75.3s)]
*  in bringing in a new strongman. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=79.44s)]
*  Andy, can you share with our audience [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  what life was like under the Marcos regime? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=84.0s)]
*  Well, in 1986, I was one of those that marched at the end of the revolution [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=87.44s)]
*  when they were deposed and they went to Hawaii. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=94.68s)]
*  And since then, of course, there has already been a big debate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=98.14s)]
*  as to what their legacy was going to be. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=101.92s)]
*  Initially, it was very clear that there was a lot of money [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=106.12s)]
*  that was taken out of the public treasury [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=110.02s)]
*  and used to purchase all sorts of assets all over the world. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=112.56s)]
*  What are assets? When I think of assets, what do you mean? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=116.12s)]
*  Well, again, when I was the chairman of the Presidential Commission [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=117.9s)]
*  on Good Government in 2010, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=120.54s)]
*  and this was already 25 years after the fact, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=121.94s)]
*  we were able to assemble a list of these assets. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=125.0s)]
*  And there has been a focus on the shoes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=127.78s)]
*  But when you think about it, those shoes are really a distraction [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=132.58s)]
*  because they sort of like give you the impression [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=136.38s)]
*  that it was just frivolous shopping. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=139.5s)]
*  No, this was shopping at its best [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=141.34s)]
*  or in four of the best buildings in Manhattan [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=144.14s)]
*  were once owned by the Marcos, the best paintings in the world, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  jewelry that could rival with the monarchy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  and a lot of cash and securities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=155.42s)]
*  So I think this is what people should focus on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=157.28s)]
*  In 1986, the estimate was about $10 billion, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=160.06s)]
*  and that was conservative. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=163.62s)]
*  And remember, 1986, that was again 40 years ago, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  the PCGG was only able to recover $4 billion in total. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=168.96s)]
*  So you can just imagine how much that money is now in real terms. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=174.66s)]
*  Let's take a look at a clip where Melda Barcos [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=179.44s)]
*  is lamenting the loss of some of her wealth. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=182.24s)]
*  Oh, they sequestered everything. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=186.24s)]
*  All the jewelry that they would find, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=191.12s)]
*  all the valuables that they would encounter, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=193.62s)]
*  all the beautiful things. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=197.72s)]
*  The PCGG just would confiscate anything they wanted to get [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=199.32s)]
*  that they felt was stolen. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=227.94s)]
*  Even this house only a few months ago was being auctioned off. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  We cannot stay really here [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  because we do not know when we will be kicked out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=242.06s)]
*  Andy, what do you think when you see that clip? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=255.7s)]
*  The Philippine Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision in, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=258.54s)]
*  I think, 1994, said that the legitimate income [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  of the Marcos couple from 1965 to 1986 [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=266.58000000000004s)]
*  is somewhere in the vicinity of $320,000. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  That's it. And yet, if you look at the assets [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=275.22s)]
*  that the PCGG was able to uncover, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=279.82s)]
*  there were in the billions of dollars. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  So, all I can do, I guess, is sigh [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  when I see those kinds of clips. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=289.32s)]
*  And right after that moment, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Melda says she's complaining, and she said, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=292.96s)]
*  I had my money in 170 banks, and I can't get to it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  And so she's so upset at the PCGG. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=300.56s)]
*  Well, when Andy saw the film ... [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=303.2s)]
*  When I first saw the film, IntelliRide, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=304.84s)]
*  and I heard her say that, I told Lauren, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=307.9s)]
*  I wish I had known that when I was still in office, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=310.28s)]
*  because again, this was a revelation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=313.02s)]
*  170 bank accounts all over the world. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  He said he could have used it as evidence. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  Money is clearly so important to her. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=320.34s)]
*  In the film, she doles out dollar bills [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=322.8s)]
*  to children like Candy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  She gives them to children who are hospitalized. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=327.88s)]
*  She has these wads of cash. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  So, what does money and wealth mean to her? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=333.24s)]
*  She says something really interesting in the film, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=336.78s)]
*  which is that she would spend an hour getting ready [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=339.32s)]
*  before she would go to the poorest slums, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=342.88s)]
*  because the poor want a star in the dark of the night. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what she wants, is to be that star. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=348.98s)]
*  And so whether it's handing out money, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=353.24s)]
*  or wearing beautiful dresses, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=355.3s)]
*  or having shoes in palaces, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=357.0s)]
*  it's about being that queenly figure [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=359.98s)]
*  that gives her the kind of love and adoration of the people. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=363.68s)]
*  And I think that's why she wants to get back. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  Did she believe the things she says, or is she a liar? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=371.28s)]
*  I think that she has convinced herself [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=376.4s)]
*  of this version of history that she says. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=378.76s)]
*  She speaks with great conviction, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=383.36s)]
*  and is a little bit disconnected, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=386.08s)]
*  like she's in her own world. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=388.78s)]
*  What's an example? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=390.2s)]
*  Well, I guess one of the most egregious examples [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=392.74s)]
*  was when she said martial law [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=395.4s)]
*  was a great time in the Philippines, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=397.9s)]
*  and it was a great time for Filipino sovereignty [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=400.38s)]
*  and human rights. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=403.86s)]
*  And it was a time that was terrible for human rights. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=405.62s)]
*  70,000 in prison, 30,000 tortured, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=409.3s)]
*  more than 3,000 killed. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=413.34000000000003s)]
*  So the fact that she could say [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=415.16s)]
*  it was one of the greatest times of the Marcus regime, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=416.58000000000004s)]
*  and a good time for human rights, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=419.38s)]
*  has no relation in reality. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think that there you have to see [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=427.06s)]
*  that she does have agency and strategy [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=430.26s)]
*  about what she's saying, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=433.92s)]
*  because by saying it's the best time, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=434.96s)]
*  she's rewriting history, erasing the sins of the past, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=438.2s)]
*  in a way that positions her and her family [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=443.68s)]
*  to return to power. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=446.96s)]
*  Here is Russia. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=456.96s)]
*  Here. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=461.26s)]
*  Here is Russia with Burgundy there. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  And here is Mrs. Mao. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=469.92s)]
*  This is President Dixon playing the piano, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=479.96s)]
*  and I'm singing there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=483.0s)]
*  He was there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=484.26s)]
*  He would come and call on me at my suite at Waldorf. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=485.9s)]
*  He was very nice and very human, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  but he was misunderstood. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=495.32s)]
*  And I want to get your reaction out. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=498.88s)]
*  You've seen the film. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=500.0s)]
*  Amel De Marcos talks about how easy it is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=501.58s)]
*  to work with world leaders. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=504.59999999999997s)]
*  What did you think when you heard her say that? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=506.46s)]
*  Well, she was telling the truth in the sense [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=509.34s)]
*  that she really had access to all of these world leaders. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=511.85999999999996s)]
*  And I think that in fairness to her, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=515.3399999999999s)]
*  she was able to charm them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=518.74s)]
*  And at the same time, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=520.86s)]
*  and again, this was also described in the film, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=522.1s)]
*  how President Marcos would use her [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=524.02s)]
*  as like a diplomatic butterfly [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=526.4599999999999s)]
*  to try and butter up to these leaders. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=529.9s)]
*  And yes, she probably was successful in a certain way, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=532.02s)]
*  but at the same time, she was also claiming [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=536.0s)]
*  that she was the one that started the end of the Cold War [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=537.86s)]
*  and things like this, which to my mind is a bit delusional. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=542.0s)]
*  It's a very personal brand of politics [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=544.56s)]
*  where if somebody is nice to her, she likes them. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  And so we see her befriending dictators [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=550.64s)]
*  of a kind of rogues gallery, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=554.66s)]
*  Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  and saying people thought these people were monsters, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=558.76s)]
*  but they were actually generous and kind. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=561.52s)]
*  Of course, that's also the paradox of Amelda's character. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=563.54s)]
*  In person, she is generous and kind, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=567.16s)]
*  and yet she's been responsible for terrible consequences [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=570.12s)]
*  of the Marcos regime and also the Duterte presidency. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=575.18s)]
*  Can you connect Amelda Marcos [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=579.74s)]
*  to the 2016 election in the Philippines? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=582.5s)]
*  You mean the election of Duterte as president? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=585.92s)]
*  That was a revelation that was kind of a breaking news piece [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=588.5s)]
*  at the end of our story. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=593.66s)]
*  At first, I knew that Duterte admired Marcos, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  but it wasn't until he revealed in a press conference [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  that Amy Marcos, the daughter of Amelda, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=604.68s)]
*  had given him financing for the campaign [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  that we really realized the extent of the alliance. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=610.68s)]
*  Shortly after that, Duterte, after he became president, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=613.8399999999999s)]
*  allowed a heroes' burial for President Marcos, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  which people who had been in people power [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=622.24s)]
*  and opposed the Marcos and knew of their crimes [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=624.28s)]
*  were just horrified that he could be buried [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=628.14s)]
*  in a hero's cemetery. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=631.26s)]
*  I mean, Eta Rosales, who was head [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=632.3s)]
*  of the Human Rights Commission, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=634.54s)]
*  says in the beginning of the film, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=635.6s)]
*  the Filipino people would never allow that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=637.38s)]
*  And so the unthinkable happened, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=640.86s)]
*  and it was interpreted as a quid pro quo for the money. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=643.06s)]
*  A what? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=648.78s)]
*  You brought me to my question. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=649.62s)]
*  A lot of what you've described, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=652.18s)]
*  it reminds many people, if you watch this film, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=653.84s)]
*  of what's going on in this country right now. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=657.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you see parallels? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=659.12s)]
*  There were a lot of stunning parallels, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=660.2s)]
*  and that definitely influenced me [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=661.9s)]
*  in the making and editing of the film [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=663.6s)]
*  and thinking about that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=667.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, Duterte, like Trump, was a surprise. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=668.6600000000001s)]
*  He was somebody that made people feel [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=673.6800000000001s)]
*  like he was one of the people. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=676.58s)]
*  He swears a lot, and he's very vulgar in his language, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  yet he does come from an elite background. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=681.34s)]
*  It was an election that was influenced [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=685.88s)]
*  by disinformation and fake news propagated [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=688.5400000000001s)]
*  through social media. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=691.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think because there was so much poverty, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=693.1400000000001s)]
*  they were able to be influenced both by social media [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=697.22s)]
*  and by money that was offered in exchange [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=701.82s)]
*  for voting, as can happen in the Philippines. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  And so people wanted the kind of change, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=706.9s)]
*  promises of change, that a strong man [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=711.62s)]
*  in the form of Duterte offered. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=714.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think, I hope it can be a cautionary tale for us. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=717.3s)]
*  It's more extreme, of course, than we are living here. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=722.98s)]
*  More than 30,000 people have been killed [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=726.74s)]
*  in extrajudicial killings. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=728.86s)]
*  But some of the attacks on the press, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=730.86s)]
*  on the independence of the judiciary, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=734.4s)]
*  do make us think of the threats to our democracy here. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=739.78s)]
*  What does Amel Demarcos understand [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=744.02s)]
*  about politics and the media? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=746.04s)]
*  She attacks the media very much like President Trump, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=748.66s)]
*  and at one point she said, the media, no, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=752.62s)]
*  she said the gun can only kill you until the grave, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  but the media can kill you beyond the grave to infinity. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  And it's one of these kind of brilliant statements [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  that she will come out with, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=766.68s)]
*  where you realize she has such a profound understanding [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=769.28s)]
*  of the dynamics of modern media. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=773.9799999999999s)]
*  When she said, perception is real and the truth is not, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  she's also speaking to that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=781.36s)]
*  Lauren, we have a clip of Bong Bong Marcos [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=784.12s)]
*  being asked a question in a press conference. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=787.52s)]
*  Can you set this up for us a little bit? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes, this is right after the big vice presidential debate, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=790.48s)]
*  and in the debate, his opponent Lenny Roberto [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=794.1s)]
*  pushed him on the ill-gotten wealth [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  that his family had taken from the Philippines. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=799.34s)]
*  And so he goes out to a press conference [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=801.82s)]
*  and they ask him about the ill-gotten wealth. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=806.62s)]
*  And the ill-gotten wealth, sir? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=808.46s)]
*  You don't have any of that? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=810.5s)]
*  No, we don't have any. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=812.3000000000001s)]
*  All of my assets are in the bank, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=813.8000000000001s)]
*  it's clear where they come from, it's clear what... [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=817.0600000000001s)]
*  None of this is ill-gotten? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=822.02s)]
*  None of your wealth is ill-gotten, sir? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=824.3000000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=825.94s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=826.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=828.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=829.14s)]
*  Senator Marcos is spending a lot of money in this campaign. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=830.98s)]
*  He's been paying off mayors, congressmen, governors. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=834.78s)]
*  He's been giving out money left and right. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=841.14s)]
*  And you ask yourself, where is all that money coming from? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=844.02s)]
*  And this goes to a scene where we go back [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=847.42s)]
*  to Imelda's apartment and we see the Picasso's [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=849.3399999999999s)]
*  and the priceless artwork in her apartment, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=853.2199999999999s)]
*  and then Andy tells a story about raiding the apartment, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=855.8199999999999s)]
*  trying to get these paintings of ill-gotten wealth. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=859.66s)]
*  This one is of course of Picasso. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=864.04s)]
*  Marcos would say, Imelda, I know how to earn money properly, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  but you know how to spend money properly [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=872.28s)]
*  because you buy beauty. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=874.28s)]
*  This is by Tragonard and the other one is Michelangelo. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  We filed a motion with the Philippine Graph Court [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=884.56s)]
*  called the Sandigan Bayan, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=888.4s)]
*  and asked for a writ of attachment on these paintings [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=890.0s)]
*  because they are the subject of litigation. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=893.92s)]
*  There was a team that went to her house in Makati, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=897.76s)]
*  and they took photographs of the walls. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=902.12s)]
*  You could see that the paintings have been replaced. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=907.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=912.6s)]
*  This is another interesting photo. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=913.96s)]
*  Here you can see the bust of President Marcos, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=916.48s)]
*  and there are two important paintings [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=920.12s)]
*  on the left and right side, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=922.32s)]
*  but subsequently when the raiding team came in, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=923.9200000000001s)]
*  there's the bust, the medals are still there, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=927.9200000000001s)]
*  but instead of paintings you have the photos [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=930.64s)]
*  of Mrs. Marcos and President Marcos, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=932.84s)]
*  so they were removed. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=935.88s)]
*  There's the Michelangelo. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=938.4s)]
*  The photo of President Marcos instead. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=942.08s)]
*  We got contacted by the New York District Attorney's Office [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=945.32s)]
*  under Cyrus Vance Jr. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=948.36s)]
*  to investigate a suspicious sale [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=950.2800000000001s)]
*  of a Monet water lily painting [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=952.8000000000001s)]
*  that was being sold by the secretary of Mrs. Marcos. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=955.44s)]
*  In trying to build the case, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  I was tasked to meet with Mrs. Marcos personally [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=962.08s)]
*  to ask her whether or not that painting belonged to her. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=965.96s)]
*  So together with a colleague, we went to her apartment, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=970.5200000000001s)]
*  and I asked her, Mrs. Marcos, is this Monet painting yours? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=974.76s)]
*  And without batting an eyelash, in Filipino she tells me, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=978.52s)]
*  you know what, there were so many of them, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=981.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't anymore remember. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=984.48s)]
*  And then after that she ushers me into the elevator, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=987.28s)]
*  and as we were going down, but she said, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=989.92s)]
*  in case I say that this painting is mine, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=992.92s)]
*  will they give it back to me? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  So this was the same time though [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=998.24s)]
*  that I saw the Picasso and the Michelangelo, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=999.8399999999999s)]
*  and immediately after that we went to the court [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1002.8199999999999s)]
*  to obtain a search warrant in order to get these paintings. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1006.74s)]
*  But it takes some time in the Philippines to issue a warrant, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1011.5s)]
*  and by the time that the authorities [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1015.1s)]
*  were able to serve the warrant, the paintings were gone. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1017.18s)]
*  Andy, you were the chairman on the commission on election [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1021.1s)]
*  during this 2016 race. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1024.66s)]
*  You are no longer living in the Philippines. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1027.78s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1029.8999999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1030.74s)]
*  I left the country in 2018, and sorry, no, 2017, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1031.58s)]
*  and this happened because there was a lot of pressure, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1037.8999999999999s)]
*  and if I can just relate, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1040.34s)]
*  I was here during the November 2016 elections. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1043.5s)]
*  I was an observer in Washington, D.C. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  When I came home to Manila, all of a sudden, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1051.6999999999998s)]
*  my house was being guarded by armed guards, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1056.46s)]
*  and I was being prevented from returning to my own house. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1060.46s)]
*  When I got inside the house, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1064.42s)]
*  I saw that my personal files had been ransacked, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1066.1000000000001s)]
*  my computers had been hacked, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1070.42s)]
*  and that there was this huge extortion play [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1075.06s)]
*  against me and my family, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1078.3s)]
*  and that went on for several months [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1080.58s)]
*  to the point that I felt that for the good of my family, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1082.74s)]
*  especially for my children, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1085.78s)]
*  perhaps I should first leave the country [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1087.06s)]
*  in order to give them breathing space. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1089.58s)]
*  The name of the film is The Kingmaker, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1091.9399999999998s)]
*  Lauren Greenfield and Annie Bedouista. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1093.54s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1095.62s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1097.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1098.34s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKV3kaRz6E&t=1099.1799999999998s)]
