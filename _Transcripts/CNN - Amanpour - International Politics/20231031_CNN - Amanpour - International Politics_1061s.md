# Are Global Crises Making America an “Overstretched Superpower”?  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY)
*  And as we see from Ukraine to Israel and beyond, the world is facing serious series of challenges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=0.0s)]
*  And the United States is involved in all of them. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=8.24s)]
*  In a recent article, the Economist diplomatic editor Anton LaGuardia argues the U.S. could [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=10.8s)]
*  be overstretched, and he gives Hari Srinivasan the view of America from abroad. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=16.12s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=21.48s)]
*  Anton LaGuardia, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=22.48s)]
*  In a recent issue of The Economist, you essentially laid out the case why you thought that American [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=24.4s)]
*  power is going to be tested, and it may be on the decline. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=30.84s)]
*  So sort of set the scene for us if you can. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=34.16s)]
*  What are the challenges facing the administration and Joe Biden? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=36.54s)]
*  Well, the administration has already been extremely busy trying to support Ukraine in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=40.92s)]
*  its war against Russia, you know, at the cost of tens of billions of dollars worth of military [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=46.76s)]
*  equipment and economic aid. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=53.48s)]
*  And people were already asking whether the U.S. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  and its allies had the wherewithal to deal with a contingency over, say, Taiwan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  Now you have the crisis in the Middle East happening. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=66.0s)]
*  So this is a second war that the U.S. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=68.36s)]
*  is involved in indirectly, but in this case more directly, in that it sent two whole carrier [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  strike groups to areas around the Middle East. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  And Asian allies notice these things, that a lot of hardware is going to the Middle East and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=82.44s)]
*  hardware that they would presumably like to see close to Asia. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=87.64s)]
*  But it goes beyond merely, you know, America's military deployments. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=93.08s)]
*  It has to do with the can America's industrial base support the now three sets of allies, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=100.2s)]
*  Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan at the same time, all of which it is trying to arm into the kind of, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=108.36s)]
*  you know, to help them wage their own conflicts or at least deter attack in the future. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=115.16s)]
*  And then that in turn leads to the whole question of America's political polarization and the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=122.12s)]
*  paralysis that you've seen in Congress until now, where, you know, money for Ukraine is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=130.2s)]
*  extremely hard to come by. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=135.8s)]
*  And you've had the hold up over the speaker of the House, which, you know, may now be resolved, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=138.68s)]
*  but we don't know whether money for Ukraine, for example, will be forthcoming. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  – Assess President Biden's handling so far of the Israel Hamas war. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=149.0s)]
*  He has been a staunch ally of Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=155.56s)]
*  He's taken the steps necessary so that that is visible for the entire planet to see. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=160.28s)]
*  As you said, he's moved two carrier strike groups into the region to let the region know that the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  United States wants to minimize the outbreak of this war from getting further. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=172.92s)]
*  But what does he have to do right now in how he postures with Israel, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=178.44s)]
*  but at the same time tries to stop this war? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  – He's got a very difficult hand to play. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  I think he is instinctively and emotionally close to Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=192.68s)]
*  So he has embraced Israel, hugged them close to show that America stands behind Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=197.4s)]
*  And I think that comes from a deeply held conviction. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=205.08s)]
*  He calls himself a Zionist. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=207.56s)]
*  At the same time, I think he's also trying to embrace Israel in a sense as a form of restraint [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=209.88s)]
*  to say, look, as your best friend, I have your best interests at heart. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=215.4s)]
*  And I think that you need to keep this conflict within bounds, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  of the laws of war, but also within political bounds so that the humanitarian suffering [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=226.36s)]
*  in Gaza is not deemed to be excessive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=232.6s)]
*  And you're hearing ever louder voices that the pain of the population in Gaza [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=236.12s)]
*  is reaching levels that are extremely worrying, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=245.96s)]
*  not just in terms of water, humanitarian supplies, applied to hospitals, and so on. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=251.0s)]
*  So he is trying to buy the Israelis time, give them the opportunity to try and get at Hamas, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=256.12s)]
*  but also make sure that it is done within bounds that are politically bearable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=263.88s)]
*  Is there a risk here for the president in destabilizing the region further by taking [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=270.36s)]
*  the actions that he's taken to show this much support for Israel, especially if [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=279.56s)]
*  patience starts to wear thin in the international community, that perhaps this response from Israel [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=285.88s)]
*  is disproportionate already, but it could be much worse? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=293.96s)]
*  If President Biden can show that he has moderated Israel's response, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=298.76s)]
*  then I think his embrace of Israel will be seen as a wise thing to do. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=306.36s)]
*  If, however, it becomes a terrible, which is already a terrible humanitarian cost, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=311.96s)]
*  but even worse, imposes an even worse humanitarian plight on Gazans and Palestinians, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=318.12s)]
*  and leads to even larger, much larger loss of life, then there's a danger that the US will be [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=325.0s)]
*  tarred by the same brush, will become, in a sense, complicit in the eyes of the world [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=333.24s)]
*  in what is happening in Gaza. I mean, needless to say, the United States is a big part of the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=340.44s)]
*  international community and has a say, but it is striking that the Western allies who are so united [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=346.28s)]
*  on the question of Ukraine are more divided on the question of Israel and Palestine. So you had a UN [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=354.2s)]
*  council resolution, which was vetoed by the United States, was the United Kingdom abstained, and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=361.24s)]
*  France votes in favor. You don't see that kind of three-way split over Ukraine, typically. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=368.84s)]
*  Does this have put into focus traditionally what has been the role of the United States as [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=375.08s)]
*  the mediator, the negotiator, the person you can call? I mean, in one sense, I don't see [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=381.08s)]
*  the phone lines burning up everywhere else on the planet saying, hey, help us get out of this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=387.32s)]
*  situation, but at the same time, the day before he was scheduled to meet with the Jordanian leader [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=392.84s)]
*  and the Palestinian leadership, there was that horrible rocket shelling at the hospital, which [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  changed all the plans. I think it's telling that three Arab leaders felt able to shun the American [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=405.72s)]
*  president and basically say, please don't come. And it says something about the strength of opinion [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  on the Arab street that Arab leaders are sort of worried about the demonstrations that were starting [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=418.44000000000005s)]
*  together. But I think it also says something about declining American power and influence in the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  region. Nevertheless, it is, you know, the United States remains the only address in part because [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=431.32s)]
*  they're the only people who can really speak to Israel and try to help Israel find a way through. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  And one of the things that the United States needs to do is to help Israel think in itself, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=443.48s)]
*  think with Arab leaders, well, what happens the day after? Let's assume for a moment Israel is [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=449.16s)]
*  successful in evicting Hamas from Gaza, which is not an easy order, but let's assume it's successful, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=455.0s)]
*  then what? And history has shown that after previous wars, Hamas does come back. It is a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=464.84s)]
*  political movement and a social movement. And there is at the moment no alternative power [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=471.32s)]
*  that is going to rule the Gaza Strip. And unless that part of the problem is fixed, then it's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=476.52s)]
*  unfortunately likely to lead to yet another cycle of violence. You know, the president tried to make [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=483.24s)]
*  the case to the American public to get Congress to fund both our involvement in the support of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=488.6s)]
*  Ukraine, as well as our involvement in the support of Israel. He wanted to try to tie those two things [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  along with national security at home. When he's asking Congress for the money, he said, quote, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=504.2s)]
*  Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common. They both want [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=508.84s)]
*  to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it. Is his plea getting [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  through, especially to a new speaker of the House who wants to try to separate these different [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=519.56s)]
*  engagements? It seems that it's not getting through to him in particular. He would like to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=529.4s)]
*  separate the bundles and they would like to vote on Israel, which is extremely popular. And it's [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=536.28s)]
*  not entirely clear what they want to do on Ukraine. On Ukraine, there is still a bipartisan majority [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  that supports helping Ukraine against Russia, particularly as the counteroffensive is stalling [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=549.16s)]
*  and a long war is in prospect. But it is becoming more difficult to get more money, particularly for [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=557.48s)]
*  Republicans. And the pro-Ukraine Republicans are saying, look, let's have one big vote on Ukraine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=565.64s)]
*  Let's give them the money they need for the coming year. Let's not come back to this again [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=571.4s)]
*  in an election year. Whether they succeed in doing that is open to question. The rules of Congress [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=576.36s)]
*  are what they are. And it seems to me that a substantial minority of anti-Ukraine Republicans [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=584.76s)]
*  do have some kind of veto over what the House does, which in turns means that they have a veto [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=596.04s)]
*  on what Congress as a whole does. So unless a pro-Ukraine Republicans are willing to cross the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=602.84s)]
*  island, obtain votes from Democrats on this particular question, it's difficult to see how [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  things really progress. The other elephant in the room, if you will, is China. China seems to be [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=617.16s)]
*  the sort of third major international crisis that President Biden has to confront. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=625.0s)]
*  Well, President Biden coming into office was hoping to have stable and predictable relations [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=631.8s)]
*  in Europe with Russia and to park the Middle East in order to concentrate on the Indo-Pacific. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=637.16s)]
*  And that's not the way it's turned out. He's got a major war in Europe and he's now got a major war [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=645.4s)]
*  in the Middle East to manage. And the question is whether China, seeing a stretched America, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=650.68s)]
*  will see an opportunity to act on Taiwan, whether in the gray zone or as an overt invasion. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=659.48s)]
*  It's not mechanical. A lot depends on the politics of what happens in Taiwan and the United States, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=673.3199999999999s)]
*  both of which have elections next year and indeed in the politics of what happens within [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=678.68s)]
*  the Communist Party, which are harder to divide. Nevertheless, military strategists worry about [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=683.16s)]
*  a supposed window of vulnerability when China's military strength will continue to increase and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=690.68s)]
*  America's will not catch up until the 2030s when new investments begin to bear fruit. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=696.12s)]
*  In the meantime, there is a move towards helping Taiwan become more of a porcupine with more of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=702.92s)]
*  the defensive weapons to hold off a potential Chinese invasion. You've started to see some [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=709.7199999999999s)]
*  weapons being made available to Taiwan and this new package of national security supplemental [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=717.64s)]
*  funding that President Biden requested appears to contain money for Taiwan as well. But that's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  certainly one that is worth watching. And I think for a lot of people, Americans in the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=732.28s)]
*  Indo-Pacific, every day that passes without a Chinese attack on Taiwan is a good day. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  Earlier this month, Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, wrote in Foreign Affairs that [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=745.16s)]
*  the United States is under utilizing or even undermining our alliances with other democracies. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=750.52s)]
*  And I wonder if the United States has been able to reframe and adjust those relationships. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=758.92s)]
*  It is true that America's alliances were put under great strain in the Trump years. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=766.5999999999999s)]
*  And it is also true that the Biden administration has invested a great deal of effort in [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=773.7199999999999s)]
*  bringing together its allies, both in Europe and in Asia. And Russia's invasion of Ukraine [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  has been a catalyst for that. NATO is more compact than it's been for a long time. It has a renewed [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=789.0799999999999s)]
*  sense of purpose. Japan, Australia and others have also tried to help Europe against Russia [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=794.68s)]
*  in the belief that or in the hope that in future, should there be a contingency in Asia, Europe will [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=802.5999999999999s)]
*  come to their aid in turn. So you're seeing this kind of network of alliances growing closer [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=808.5999999999999s)]
*  together, on top of which you've had this ad hoc patchwork of relationship. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=818.04s)]
*  So I think on the alliance front, the administration has done a fairly good job. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=823.8s)]
*  The question is whether the crisis in the Middle East, where the U.S. takes a position that is [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=831.16s)]
*  somewhat different from that of most of its allies, will put a new strain on it. At the moment, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=836.68s)]
*  I don't think it's a problem, but it might become a problem in the future, particularly if it starts [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=845.32s)]
*  to have repercussions across the Middle East and so on. And you, for example, get a flow of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=850.84s)]
*  migrants from the Arab world into Europe. The other way that this affects things is just the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=856.12s)]
*  amount of attention America can pay to any particular set of regional problems. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=865.08s)]
*  The last thing to say is that the administration came in with a very strong [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=871.0s)]
*  democracies versus autocracies mindset and worldview. It has somewhat moderated that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=875.48s)]
*  because it realized it needs the help of countries that are not necessarily democracies. For example, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=882.28s)]
*  Vietnam, which is not a democracy, but is a useful partner with which to counterbalance China. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=887.8s)]
*  I think you're seeing a more nuanced perception by the administration. So far, so good, but there is [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=896.04s)]
*  still some way to go. And by the way, if Congress were to cut off aid to Ukraine, that would put a [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=904.36s)]
*  huge amount of strain on relations with the Europeans. Given the dysfunction inside our own [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=911.0799999999999s)]
*  government over the past several weeks, and given how stretched the United States is in all of these [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=918.12s)]
*  different theaters, I wonder what that says to countries that are our allies on whether or not [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=925.88s)]
*  we can be a partner that can be counted on. It is a worry around the world among America's friends [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=935.16s)]
*  and partners, but it's a worry they can't do much about. So their only choice is to keep trying to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=943.32s)]
*  work with the United States. It's easier with Joe Biden. It will be harder. It was harder with [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, and it may be harder again if he is reelected. So sure, countries can try and hedge [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  somewhat. You hear, for example, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying this is time [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=966.68s)]
*  for Europe to gain some strategic autonomy because we cannot always rely on the United States. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=973.4799999999999s)]
*  And indeed, even under Joe Biden, there are still these sort of tendencies for America to close in [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=981.16s)]
*  on itself. Aid to Ukraine may not always be forthcoming. Therefore, we must do more. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=989.8s)]
*  The problem, of course, is that Europeans don't yet have the wherewithal to do it. Becoming more [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=996.76s)]
*  autonomous is a generation-long effort, and it's slow progress because they too have to trade off [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1003.4799999999999s)]
*  spending on defense and security against social spending and all the other problems that they must [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1012.52s)]
*  confront. So it's difficult. It's easier and cheaper to do things together as allies. It's [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1018.04s)]
*  harder to do it separate. And there are big questions about whether Europe can do it [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1024.2s)]
*  given the lack of American leadership. If American leadership were lacking, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1031.24s)]
*  guidance and the nuclear umbrella that the United States extends over a place like Europe. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1036.12s)]
*  Anton LaGuardia from The Economist, thanks so much for your time. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1042.04s)]
*  Great to talk to you. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-TsG-zdaY&t=1044.6799999999998s)]
