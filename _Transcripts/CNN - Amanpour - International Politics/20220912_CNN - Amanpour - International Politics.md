Video Description: Following a stunning Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv -- and for the first time since his February invasion -- Putin is facing mounting criticism from his own side. Loyal commentators have asked whether he miscalculated or was misinformed. Deputies from 18 municipal districts in Moscow, St. Petersburg and elsewhere are now calling on Putin to resign. The former commander of American forces in Europe, General Ben Hodges (Ret.), joined Christiane from Germany.

# The Impending Total Collapse of Russian Forces Gen. Ben Hodges on Ukraine  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [September 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48)
*  Over a month ago you tweeted, Russia's logistics system is exhausted, can't replace systems [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=0.0s)]
*  and parts, transport overstretched, signs of the impending total collapse of Russian forces. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=6.0s)]
*  Sanctions are working, send Ukraine what it needs and maintain pressure on the Kremlin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=12.48s)]
*  This could be over by the end of the year. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=17.2s)]
*  Well, General Hodges, you obviously know the lay of the land, the battlefield, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=19.92s)]
*  you're a commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=23.36s)]
*  But at that time, that prediction was really out of step. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=26.48s)]
*  Nobody was saying that. In fact, people were saying, oh my gosh, you know, have we miscalculated? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=29.6s)]
*  Can the Ukrainians do this? Should they sue for peace? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=35.2s)]
*  You were very bold. Do you still think it could be over by the end of the year? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=38.72s)]
*  Well, we know that war is a test of will and it's a test of logistics. And it's clear [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=44.88s)]
*  that the Ukrainians have superior will, both their soldiers and their amazing population of people, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  compared to Russian forces. We know that the Russian logistic system is exhausted and it's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  in worse shape now than it was a month ago, whereas the Ukrainians are benefiting from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  not only their own experience, but also continuing aid from the United States, UK and others. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=71.2s)]
*  So the real test of will is going to be does the West stick together, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=77.52s)]
*  stick with the Ukrainian government, or does the Kremlin have the superior will? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=82.88s)]
*  I absolutely believe that Ukrainian forces will push Russian forces back at least to the 23 February [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  line by the end of this year and that Crimea early next year will be totally under the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=94.72s)]
*  control of Ukrainian forces. It could all go faster. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=100.24s)]
*  you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmmsApGw48&t=117.6s)]
