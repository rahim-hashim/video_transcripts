# Analyzing the Potential for War Between the US and Iran | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE)
*  What we have right now is calls for de-escalation, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=0.0s)]
*  and people don't want war, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=3.24s)]
*  and yet both sides calling each other terrorists, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=4.74s)]
*  blaming each other for this action [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=7.38s)]
*  that finally took place, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=10.34s)]
*  the targeted killing of Rassem Soleimani. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Just respond to what you're hearing right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=14.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for me, it unfortunately feels [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=19.28s)]
*  like a classic case of a cycle of escalation, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=21.38s)]
*  We've had this tit-for-tat going on for about a year. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  We certainly escalated with the killing of Qasem Soleimani, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=28.82s)]
*  and this idea that somehow the cycle of escalation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=32.699999999999996s)]
*  is now going to lead to cooler heads prevailing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=35.46s)]
*  just doesn't track with sort of normal kind of conflict [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=37.9s)]
*  and how it starts. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=42.84s)]
*  And I don't actually question the Secretary of Defense [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  or even the President's intent [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  that they don't want to get into a war, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=49.14s)]
*  but most wars are not intended. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  Most wars, you know, you get this tit-for-tat [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=53.84s)]
*  that goes in this spiral, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=56.16s)]
*  and then suddenly each side has its back up, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=57.5s)]
*  and you can't back down, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=59.779999999999994s)]
*  and you inadvertently fall into war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  And that, to me, I think we are at very high risk [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=63.22s)]
*  of doing right now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=65.42s)]
*  So it's not just about intent. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=67.02s)]
*  It's our actions mean something beyond our control. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  So you served two tours of duty in Iraq. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=72.36s)]
*  You're a former CIA analyst. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=75.02s)]
*  Secretary Esper commanded troops, infantry troops, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=77.22s)]
*  in the first Gulf War in Iraq. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=80.16s)]
*  I tried to ask him, how are you reading your enemy? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=82.0s)]
*  Everybody has to read and know their enemy [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  in order to respond. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=87.08s)]
*  And you just heard Vice President Ebtikhar say [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=88.38s)]
*  the streets of Iran have already responded, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=90.92s)]
*  and they are demanding more than just these outpourings [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  on the streets, but action. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=96.7s)]
*  How do you read, with all your knowledge and experience [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  and intelligence gathering, what the message from Iran is? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=101.86s)]
*  Well, listen, I mean, I just, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=107.1s)]
*  the first thing you need to think about is, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  what if something like this happened to us, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=110.54s)]
*  And I'm not saying that Qasem Soleimani is a good guy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=113.64s)]
*  That guy is not a good guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=116.56s)]
*  And the idea that the Vice President was putting forth [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=117.92s)]
*  that Iran only wants peace and safety in the region, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=120.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, that is just not factually correct. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=123.86000000000001s)]
*  That said, imagine if any country had the equivalent [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=127.04s)]
*  of a CIA, head of CIA or four-star general killed, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  there would certainly be pressure to respond. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=135.28s)]
*  And obviously the pictures in Iran are striking. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  The Iranian political leaders are gonna be [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=140.82s)]
*  under tremendous pressure to do something. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=142.66s)]
*  And what we know from Iranians behavior [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  is that they don't always respond in a symmetric, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=147.18s)]
*  sort of predictable way. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  They're gonna take their time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=151.52s)]
*  They're gonna think about how to get back at us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=152.62s)]
*  And that to me is extremely dangerous. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  So even if there are cooler heads in Tehran right now, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=157.06s)]
*  just watching what's going on in their own streets, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  they're going to feel pressure to respond. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  And that is dangerous. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=165.3s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=167.3s)]
*  We'll be talking about the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkVlpkX4QHE&t=169.54000000000002s)]
