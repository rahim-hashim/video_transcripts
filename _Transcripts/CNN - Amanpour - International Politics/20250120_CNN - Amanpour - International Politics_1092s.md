# “Trump Is Going to Get a Lot of Wins:” Ian Bremmer Forecasts 2025 Geopolitics | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc)
*  Now to Russia's war in Ukraine and U.S. relations with China. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=0.0s)]
*  We're living in a time of heightened geopolitical instability. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=4.16s)]
*  And according to the Eurasia Group's top risks for 2025 forecast, President Trump's policies [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=8.92s)]
*  could add fuel to the fire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=14.82s)]
*  Ian Bremmer is the president and founder of the Eurasia Group, a global political risk [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=16.68s)]
*  research and consulting firm. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=21.3s)]
*  And he joins Walter Isaacson to discuss the potential dangers that lie ahead. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=22.86s)]
*  Thank you, Paula and Ian Bremmer. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=28.86s)]
*  Welcome back to the show. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=30.46s)]
*  Good to see you, Walter. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=31.46s)]
*  Every year, your company, the Eurasia Group, has a global risk assessment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=33.24s)]
*  And this time you say, we are heading back to the law of the jungle. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=39.38s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=44.26s)]
*  I think it's the most dangerous period geopolitically since either the 30s before World War II or [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=45.5s)]
*  the early Cold War before the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=53.78s)]
*  It's a world where the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=58.52s)]
*  And the United States is both in an incredibly strong position compared to its adversaries, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=65.16s)]
*  China, massive economic challenges, worse since the 90s, maybe the 70s, Russia in deep [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=71.12s)]
*  decline, Iran having lost their empire of proxies in the region. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=76.2s)]
*  But also the U.S. is much stronger politically, economically, technologically and militarily [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=81.26s)]
*  than all of its allies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=86.8s)]
*  And that's certainly true compared to where Trump's U.S. was in 2017. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  So the fact that that power imbalance exists at a time when the United States is saying, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=94.58s)]
*  we don't want to promote collective security. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=101.28s)]
*  We don't want to promote global architecture for free trade. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=104.06s)]
*  We don't want to promote rule of law or export democracy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  No, we want to rip up our own global order, which is not something that we've seen in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=110.52s)]
*  history, and instead get countries to do cut deals with us transactionally. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=116.6s)]
*  We don't care what their political or economic systems are, but they better listen to us [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=121.86s)]
*  because otherwise there will be hell to pay. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=125.64s)]
*  That structurally is the geopolitical dynamic that is driving so much of the uncertainty [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=128.28s)]
*  in the world for the coming year. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, you say that the Trump administration is talking about tearing up the global order [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  that America has led, especially a global order based on free trade. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=141.56s)]
*  Isn't there a backlash both in the United States and in the Western world against the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=146.42s)]
*  free trade global order that left so many people out? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=152.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=155.98s)]
*  Trump isn't the lead risk here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=156.98s)]
*  Trump is the lead symptom of something that's been coming for decades, Walter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the fact is that the average American, Democrat, Republican or independent leans [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=164.66s)]
*  either way doesn't believe that free trade benefits them, doesn't believe that the U.S. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=169.76s)]
*  providing military security and by the way, fighting wars all over the world benefits [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=175.94s)]
*  them and doesn't really believe that the United States is a representative democracy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  So certainly isn't interested in trying to export that model all over the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=185.34s)]
*  So yes, that is absolutely true that the Americans don't support these things. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=190.46s)]
*  And it's also true that Trump has increasingly a lot of like minded people among allies, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=195.26s)]
*  some of whom have elected their own anti-establishment folks into office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=201.4s)]
*  Think about Javier Millet in Argentina. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Think about Najib Bukele in El Salvador. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  Heck, think about Georgia Maloney in Italy and even in countries that really, really [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=212.6s)]
*  oppose what Trump is standing for. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=218.12s)]
*  You still have large percentages of their populations that are sympathetic. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=221.52s)]
*  And Elon Musk saying that the AFD in Germany, the Alternatives for Deutschland are the only [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=225.44s)]
*  way to save the country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And he's doing that with full support of Trump or that the King of England has to step in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=233.6s)]
*  so that the British prime minister has to step down. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=239.28s)]
*  That is a message that resonates with minority parts of those populations, but growing parts [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=242.52s)]
*  of those populations, Walter. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=249.28s)]
*  You've talked about the risks of Trump coming into office, and the Democrats have said that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=251.36s)]
*  he's a risk to democracy itself. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=257.76s)]
*  Do you believe there's an imminent risk to democracy because of the Trump administration? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=261.24s)]
*  No, I think it's overstated. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=265.56s)]
*  And anyone that's watched the way that Biden has comported himself in engaging with Trump, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=268.24s)]
*  as well as his entire administration over the past transition period, would know that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=274.24s)]
*  there was a lot of exaggeration that the Democrats were using with an imminent concern that democracy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  was going to fail. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=285.1s)]
*  I don't believe that Trump is committed to rule of law or democracy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=286.38s)]
*  In fact, in many ways, I think he finds it inimical to some of what he would like to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=291.1s)]
*  accomplish as not having checks and balances as a president and as a person. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  But that is very different from what the American system would allow Trump to do. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=303.02s)]
*  The fact is that the judiciary in the U.S. may well be politically appointed, but still [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=309.38s)]
*  acts largely independently. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  The fact is that the military is still a professional military. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=316.18s)]
*  Perhaps most important, the U.S. is a federal system, and so many rules, including how elections [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=319.58s)]
*  are actually run, are not run at the federal system at the discretion of the presidency. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=326.14s)]
*  They're run by local state administrations, red and blue, that are pretty well run. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=331.9s)]
*  So all of that implies that the United States is not at the brink of dictatorship. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=339.34s)]
*  But a Trump who is willing to act in a maximally transactional way and who feels like his political [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  adversaries have used parts of the American government to go after him, whether it's impeachments [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=353.5s)]
*  that he believes are inappropriate or efforts to investigate him or put him in jail or even [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=360.38s)]
*  not getting enough Secret Service support around him. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=367.9s)]
*  And he almost was killed by an assassination attempt. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=371.61999999999995s)]
*  That does imply that he is going to be more willing than one would be comfortable with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=375.14s)]
*  to use the power ministries in the U.S., the FBI, the Department of Justice, the IRS, others, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  to go after his enemies, to politicize them, to weaponize them, because he believes they've [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=388.74s)]
*  been politicized and weaponized against him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=393.22s)]
*  And certainly, Cash Patel, who has been one of the most controversial appointments and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  has had a rough ride in his private meetings with Republican senators because he hasn't [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=404.76s)]
*  been able to adequately describe what he would do as FBI director, what his vision is for [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=409.46000000000004s)]
*  the FBI. But he's been very clear about who his enemies are, his list of enemies that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  he would want to go after if he became FBI director. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=421.02000000000004s)]
*  And I believe that that has the potential to have a chilling effect on how people are [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=425.86s)]
*  willing to comport themselves publicly. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=432.26s)]
*  And I think when you see someone like Mark Zuckerberg do a 180 in so many different ways [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=435.06s)]
*  after Trump and Elon by connection win, I think you're going to see a lot more of that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=441.58s)]
*  among political and economic elites in the United States. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=447.82s)]
*  Trump has a sort of view of the world that he can get along with people, that somehow [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=452.02s)]
*  another even the strongest, even North Korea or whatever, he can do personal diplomacy. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=456.7s)]
*  Do you think there's a possibility of an actual breakthrough and a more of an accord between [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=462.5s)]
*  the U.S. and China? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=468.29999999999995s)]
*  With Trump, never say never. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=470.02s)]
*  I mean, Trump is going to engage with Putin directly. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=471.58s)]
*  And since the war, the invasion started in 2022, Biden and Putin haven't spoken. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  So I mean, clearly there's a willingness to engage. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=480.18s)]
*  You mentioned that with the North Koreans, even Iran. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=483.14s)]
*  I mean, I think Trump is going to put very tough sanctions on Iran, much tougher than [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=485.85999999999996s)]
*  under Biden. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think there's going to be a willingness to hear out an Iranian offer under duress [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=490.9s)]
*  in Tehran that might be much more significant than the Iranian nuclear deal, the JCPOA. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=496.66s)]
*  So never say never. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=501.5s)]
*  But let's also remember, Walter, that for all of the criticism of Trump being in Putin's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=502.82000000000005s)]
*  pocket, the reality of Trump's first term is that U.S. policy towards Russia was significantly [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=508.02000000000004s)]
*  more hawkish than under Obama. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=514.22s)]
*  I mean, it was Trump that gave the Ukrainians the anti-tank javelin missiles. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=516.5s)]
*  Obama refused. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=521.38s)]
*  He thought it was going to lead to too much risk. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=522.38s)]
*  It was Trump that added to the Obama sanctions. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=524.52s)]
*  So the fact that Trump is willing to talk does not mean that you get to a deal. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=527.96s)]
*  And again, I believe that Trump will engage with Xi Jinping. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=532.88s)]
*  I think it's possible that Elon Musk will engage with Xi Jinping. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=536.84s)]
*  Wouldn't be the first time he's met him. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=541.1999999999999s)]
*  And Trump is happy to bring Elon into top relationships. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=542.8s)]
*  We've already seen that over the past weeks. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=545.96s)]
*  Elon has a lot of exposure to China. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=548.04s)]
*  But ultimately, I think the strong desire to contain China among all of Trump's key [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=550.2s)]
*  national security advisers and among all of the Republicans in Congress make this too [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=556.76s)]
*  hard. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=561.96s)]
*  I think the demands on China make this too hard. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=562.96s)]
*  The desire of the Americans to use tariffs as a principal element of economic and national [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=565.84s)]
*  security policy make this too hard. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=571.08s)]
*  So what I'm saying is that the bet that you would make this year is that U.S.-China relations [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=573.7s)]
*  get a lot worse. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=578.74s)]
*  So we've seen, it seems, a breakthrough in Gaza. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=580.14s)]
*  Do you think that President Trump is positioned to do something significant in the Middle [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=584.54s)]
*  East, given the weakening of Iran, his relationships with the Gulf states, and the changes that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=590.26s)]
*  are now happening with Israel and the Palestinians? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  Look, before October 7th, Israel was clearly the dominant military power in the region. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=600.1s)]
*  And it turns out that Israel is still the dominant military power in the region. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=605.7s)]
*  They are the ones that can determine both escalation and de-escalation on their timetable [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=609.34s)]
*  and according to their preferences. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  And they are that dominant in large part because the United States provides an immense amount [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=617.24s)]
*  of direct military aid, technological support, intelligence support, et cetera, though the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=623.08s)]
*  Israelis also have built out great autonomous capabilities. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=627.48s)]
*  Trump's best relationships in the world still are with the Israeli government and with the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=632.02s)]
*  Gulf states. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=637.86s)]
*  That was his first trip as president last time around. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=638.86s)]
*  You remember, he goes to Israel, he grabs the orb, you know, with the Saudis and all [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=641.38s)]
*  the Gulf states. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=645.82s)]
*  That is still true. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=646.82s)]
*  It's a lot of economic engagement, a lot of political engagement, a lot of support for [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=647.82s)]
*  him. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=651.3000000000001s)]
*  They were all very happy to see Trump win. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=652.3000000000001s)]
*  So he's going to be very comfortable with the fact that the Israelis and the Gulf states [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=654.58s)]
*  are on top right now and that the Iranians are in serious trouble, having lost almost [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=660.34s)]
*  all of their allies and all the people they support. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=666.9s)]
*  Hezbollah, six months ago, Hezbollah was the most powerful non-state military actor in [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=670.42s)]
*  the world and they've been functionally destroyed and the Iranians can't even get the more military [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=676.5s)]
*  support because the transit route was Assad's Syria and he's gone now too after a two week [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=681.34s)]
*  revolution that surprised everybody. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=687.22s)]
*  So yeah, I think that Trump is in the driver's seat on the Middle East. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=689.66s)]
*  One big question will be what he decides to do with that position vis-a-vis America's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=695.04s)]
*  top adversary, Iran. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=700.64s)]
*  Is he just going to put, squeeze them with more sanctions, preventing them from exporting [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=702.74s)]
*  a lot of oil through the unflagged tankers, which he can do, and it's going to hurt China, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=708.0s)]
*  it's going to hurt others, or might he consider direct military strikes even against their [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=712.48s)]
*  nuclear capabilities, which the Israeli prime minister would sorely like him to do? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=718.48s)]
*  I suspect it will be the former, not the latter, at least in the opening months, because I [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=723.4s)]
*  don't think Trump wants to risk a hundred dollar plus oil and I don't think he wants [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=729.4s)]
*  to risk a broader war that he played a role in starting. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=733.72s)]
*  But it's absolutely plausible, especially if the Iranians don't respond well to the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=738.98s)]
*  greater pressure they're going to be facing from the U.S. and from Israel. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=744.8s)]
*  Iran's on the ropes, as you say, and I think Secretary of State Blinken said in some ways [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=748.1999999999999s)]
*  they might just be able to have just a two-week breakout period before they could create more [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=753.56s)]
*  enhanced nuclear capabilities. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=760.56s)]
*  Do you think Iran is now going to do that because it's on the ropes? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  There's a very big difference between that and an operational nuclear bomb. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=767.8s)]
*  All of the experts say it's six months minimum to that and probably a year before you could [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=771.56s)]
*  actually have that bomb with some form of delivery system attached to it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=776.88s)]
*  And the period in which they would be making an effort towards that breakout would be very [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=782.88s)]
*  clear, both to the international inspectors and, of course, to the people that could stop them. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=789.8000000000001s)]
*  So I think that the Iranian government would be very, very hard pressed to take on that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  kind of a direct risk to their own regime, because if anything were going to incentivize [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=802.92s)]
*  the Israelis and the Americans to try to take that regime out, it would be that behavior. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=809.92s)]
*  What about Ukraine? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=814.92s)]
*  Do you think now that there's going to have to be a settlement or ceasefire in place? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=816.92s)]
*  Or is there some other way this can be resolved? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=822.92s)]
*  I think a ceasefire is very likely. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=825.92s)]
*  Trump certainly very strongly wants one. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=828.92s)]
*  And the European allies in NATO mostly recognize that's where we need to go because the Ukrainians [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  just don't have the capacity to continue to fight and to continue to raise the young men [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  that they have over the course of the last three years. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  And by the way, not so young men in Ukraine are doing a lot of the fighting right now. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, there's going to be a push, but it's a lot easier to get the Ukrainians to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  negotiate right now than it is the Russians. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought that one of Trump's posts in the past few weeks, very interesting, that he [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=859.0s)]
*  said, maybe the Chinese can help on Ukraine specifically because he understands that he [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=863.0s)]
*  does not have the personal leverage with Putin that the Chinese do. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=869.0s)]
*  And so, look, the idea that Trump is going to be in Putin's pocket, I think, is a myth [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=873.0s)]
*  perpetuated by his opponents. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=879.0s)]
*  He does want to end the war. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=881.0s)]
*  And I think that that willingness to end the war will include Ukraine recognizing that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=883.04s)]
*  they're not going to get a significant component of the land that Russia occupies back. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=889.04s)]
*  They're going to be de facto partitioned. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=894.04s)]
*  But Russia is going to have to accept continued security guarantees for Ukraine. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=896.04s)]
*  They're going to have to accept that, you know, the rest of Ukraine is sovereign and [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=901.04s)]
*  is aligned by and armed by the West. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=905.04s)]
*  And that's not going to be easy for Putin to accept. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=909.0799999999999s)]
*  A temporary ceasefire, sure. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  We've got 42-day ceasefire with Gaza. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=915.0799999999999s)]
*  But will that really end the fighting long term? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=917.0799999999999s)]
*  Will it really end the war, the proxy war that Russia is now fighting essentially with [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  NATO? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  And there, I think the answer is no. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  That's a much bigger long-term concern. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=929.0799999999999s)]
*  You say that Trump says that maybe China can help on the Ukraine situation. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=931.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that a good thing? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=935.0799999999999s)]
*  Do we want China to help there and even help in the Middle East? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=937.12s)]
*  I think what we don't want is for the Chinese to be pushed into a corner where they feel [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=941.12s)]
*  like they have no choice but to ally with some of the worst chaos actors in the world, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=948.12s)]
*  Russia, Iran, North Korea. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=954.12s)]
*  The Chinese, ultimately, they've done a lot with Russia. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=956.12s)]
*  We don't like, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=959.12s)]
*  I mean, they've engaged in a lot of dual-use technology export. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=961.12s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=965.16s)]
*  They've supported the Russians much more on the global stage. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=967.16s)]
*  But the Chinese ultimately want stability. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=971.16s)]
*  They want an end to the war. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=974.16s)]
*  They also want better relations with their trade partners, including the Europeans, who [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=976.16s)]
*  are much more willing to decouple from them, especially the frontline Europeans that need [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=980.16s)]
*  the Chinese capital the most, the Polish government, for example, the Romanians, because the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=984.16s)]
*  Chinese have been supportive of Russia on the Ukraine war. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=988.16s)]
*  So I think that Trump is correct to say there's no, we should be looking to engage with the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=992.1999999999999s)]
*  Chinese to try to push them in favor of stability. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=998.1999999999999s)]
*  You always put out the global risk report this time of year, but let me ask you a more [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  optimistic question. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  What's a bright spot that you see? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  What is global opportunity that's surprising to you? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, one is that Trump is going to get a lot of wins because he is actually a very [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  powerful both domestically and globally, and that will address some issues that need to [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1021.24s)]
*  be addressed, like, for example, illegal immigration in the United States been broken. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1025.24s)]
*  It'll be less broken. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1029.24s)]
*  You might not necessarily agree on every every tool he's going to use to address it, but [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1031.24s)]
*  everyone agrees it's broken. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1035.24s)]
*  That's one of the reasons he was elected. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1037.24s)]
*  And finally, Walter, there are so many things that are so exciting. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1039.24s)]
*  When I look at what you can do with A.I., when I look at at scale, just how much we're [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1042.24s)]
*  getting out of new energy and infrastructure, whether it's electric vehicles or solar or [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1048.28s)]
*  wind. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1054.28s)]
*  All of that to me at a global level is very, very exciting for our kids and for our [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1056.28s)]
*  grandchildren. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1061.28s)]
*  So this it's still the most extraordinary time to be here. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1063.28s)]
*  It's just there is a lot of China that's going to be broken, both literally and figuratively, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1066.28s)]
*  as we're making our way through it. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1071.28s)]
*  And, Bremer, as always, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1073.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnRW2P3AsNc&t=1076.28s)]
