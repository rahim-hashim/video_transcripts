# Economist on the Future of China and What the West Misunderstands  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg)
*  Now, the United States and China are looking to reset relations as the U.S. Secretary of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=0.0s)]
*  State prepares to visit Beijing this weekend. The trip comes months after the meeting was [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=4.48s)]
*  canceled when the U.S. shot down a Chinese spy balloon over its airspace. Our next guest was [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=9.52s)]
*  born in China, educated in the United States, and she is a world-renowned economist. Kay Yu Jin [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  traces China's rise and relationship with the West in her new book, and she's joining Walter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=20.96s)]
*  Isaacson with her valuable perspective. Thank you, Christiane and Kay Yu Jin. Welcome to the show. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=26.0s)]
*  Thank you. Great to be with you, Walter. The news in the past few days has been about China perhaps [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=32.8s)]
*  developing a listening or spy station in Cuba that comes on the heels of the balloons [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=39.76s)]
*  that perhaps China sent over that were surveillance balloons. As somebody was born in China, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=46.24s)]
*  has three degrees from Harvard, now lives in London and Beijing, you understand this relationship [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=52.4s)]
*  well. To what extent is there something alarming about the increase in surveillance, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=58.56s)]
*  or is that just a normal order of business between the two countries that we should live with? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=63.76s)]
*  Well, I think very few people would disagree with the statement that everybody spies on everybody, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=68.48s)]
*  but to be fair, you know, it is China is a rising nation with rising aspirations, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=73.84s)]
*  and as we've seen throughout history, all of these rising nations have had their global agenda, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=80.0s)]
*  and China certainly wants to have a greater say in the global norms and order, and it's often [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=85.68s)]
*  interpreted as aggressive tactics and acts, but the Chinese also have their own perspective. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=92.16s)]
*  They consider their influence in the region to be increasingly important. Yes, they probably have [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=99.6s)]
*  aspirations to diminish U.S. power and influence in what they believe to be their sphere of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=106.16s)]
*  influence. As we know from the Monroe Doctrine way back, the U.S. was also interested in ousting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  European powers as it became a much stronger nation, but leaving all of that aside, I think, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=118.88s)]
*  you know, in the short term, the Chinese and the Americans are pointing fingers at each other and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=124.8s)]
*  talking past each other, but most recently, they do have a desire to stabilize the relationship for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=129.12s)]
*  their own good and to take the temperature down. Well, the big news in the coming weeks will be the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=135.68s)]
*  fact that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to China, a trip that was canceled [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  earlier on or postponed earlier on because of the balloon surveillance issue. What do you think he [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=147.36s)]
*  should say on that trip, and do you have hopes that that will lower the temperature in this confrontation? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=153.52s)]
*  Look, dialogue channels have to be open. As in any relationship, as we all know, communication [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=159.68s)]
*  is key here, but they have to start really having substantive dialogue. There's also a Chinese [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=166.0s)]
*  perspective on this. For the whole list of U.S. grievances on China, there's a similar one of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=173.2s)]
*  Chinese grievances against the U.S. The dialogue needs to be kept open, but the U.S. should also [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=178.88s)]
*  focus on specific issues, specific areas where China is pushed to negotiate or change, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=186.24s)]
*  rather than having all this tension corrode the entire economic and trading relationship and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=194.8s)]
*  the world economy. I think that China believes it's new normal now with U.S. restrictions on [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=200.4s)]
*  technology, but they do have hope that trading and investment relationships can resume normality, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  and further talks about discussions on collaboration. And China has also accepted [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=213.6s)]
*  it as a new normal that these technology restrictions are simply going to be around. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=218.32s)]
*  But for the U.S., is China going to go away? No. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=222.32s)]
*  What fundamental misunderstandings do you think that Americans have about China? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=225.2s)]
*  Well, how the model works, the unique economic system, the fact that there's just a centralized [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=229.84s)]
*  state with an almighty, centralized system with an almighty state, I think they often miss the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  very creative entrepreneurial on-the-ground decentralized mechanisms that China has made [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=243.28s)]
*  China very successful, an early reformer and innovative power. But I think we also miss a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=250.24s)]
*  cultural and historical lens. This is why Americans Chinese would look at the same question and come [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  to radically different conclusions. For one, the tolerance of state. In some cases, the Chinese [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=261.12s)]
*  state intervention is not only expected, they are also desired. But the same actions would be [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=267.52s)]
*  totally intolerable to other cultures. So we come back with a different take on the similar issues, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=274.64s)]
*  and this is why we keep on talking past each other, by not seeing the other's perspective. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=280.56s)]
*  Do you think that also exists the other way, which is that China's leadership or the Chinese [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=286.56s)]
*  people have some fundamental misunderstandings about the U.S.? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=291.68s)]
*  Absolutely. I think the fundamental understanding that the U.S. wants to suppress China's growth, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=295.36s)]
*  wants to hold back China's growth, is also misplaced. I think the Chinese government [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  underestimates the scope and room for dialogue and to ease tensions with China negotiating and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=307.28s)]
*  giving up some. And also the huge impact that China could have by opening up its economy further and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  much more enthusiastically to American businesses, let them make money, give them level playing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  fields. I think these could be real accomplishments and the American businessmen will then go on and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=332.64s)]
*  lobby their governments. So I think there's a lot more to do. But from the Chinese perspective, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=339.28s)]
*  it's almost like this is it. There's nothing we can improve on. There is no ground for really [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  improving the relationship. And I think that's mistaken. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=351.84s)]
*  One of the misunderstandings we had, I think, was that if we had a greater trade relationships [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=354.8s)]
*  with China, if they were more networked into the world, if they became part of the World Trade [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=361.68s)]
*  Organization, which they did, that would lead to a gradual liberalization in China. It's worked [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  the other way. Why is that? And was that a misunderstanding? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=373.04s)]
*  Well, I think the common assumption that somehow globalization will bring convergences of all sorts [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=378.0s)]
*  apart from economic convergence was probably a mistake. And this is not just of China, but [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=384.88s)]
*  many other countries and cultures where their peoples are firmly rooted to their local [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=390.72s)]
*  communities. And China, after the WTO, is still very much Chinese. That hasn't changed. There are [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=396.56s)]
*  super official levels of convergence. The new generation, they aspire to the American lifestyle [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=404.16s)]
*  to a certain degree. They like Hollywood and NBA, but their identity is still firmly local. And the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=410.0s)]
*  fact that 80% of these half a million students studying abroad every year returning to native [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=418.24s)]
*  soil is an indication of that, even though they have great economic opportunities elsewhere. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=426.08s)]
*  And I think, yes, you're absolutely right. Political liberalization has totally stalled. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=431.68s)]
*  But we also have to ask, what does the new generation want? Yes, they have very different [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=437.44s)]
*  appetite for consumption and borrowing compared to their risk-averse parents' generation. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=442.32s)]
*  But politically, what is their mentality? Now, there are many international surveys that show [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=447.84s)]
*  they're much more open-minded and socially conscious. And I think there is a lot more [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=453.11999999999995s)]
*  convergence of social values of the new generation around the world with the Chinese. But they also [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  look abroad and do not find inspiration. They don't look at Western liberal democracies as [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  paragons of success or the other democracies that were transposed onto native soil as models that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  they aspire to. Instead, the appetite, again, for stability, for government accountability, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=474.64s)]
*  for economic opportunities, is still dominant in their thinking. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=481.28s)]
*  One of the values of the United States, a sort of a moral compass, is that liberties, free press, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=486.56s)]
*  democracy, these are good in and of themselves. Are you saying this new more cosmopolitan [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=495.2s)]
*  generation of Chinese don't really believe that? No, I don't think that's true. I'm not suggesting [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=502.48s)]
*  that in any way. I think they would want to have a freer and more open society. I think that is [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=509.36s)]
*  the desire that the general public have for China. And I think these values are evolving. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=517.76s)]
*  I just don't think that anything we should treat as totally cultural, totally indigenous, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=526.88s)]
*  and that things won't change. That's not the case. I think if you look at China in the 1990s, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=532.08s)]
*  there was a totally very liberal era, and people were debating and talking about all kinds of things. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=537.2s)]
*  So I'm not suggesting that these are fixed preferences. But what I'm saying is that, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=544.48s)]
*  first of all, if they had to choose, and I'm not saying there's necessarily a trade-off, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=550.64s)]
*  between freedom and security, as international surveys show, 95% of the Chinese population [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=555.36s)]
*  choose security over freedom. In the U.S., 37% would make the same choice. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=562.4s)]
*  You talk about surveys. You talk about the opinions that the younger generation have. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=568.08s)]
*  Some of that's in your book. To what extent are those surveys something that's reliable? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  To what extent would you, or for that matter, a younger person in China, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  want to speak out against the state? Well, these are world value surveys, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=582.72s)]
*  which are widely recognized and used, and as random a selection as possible. They're also [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=589.12s)]
*  American economists or sociologists own a gathering of data. There's a wide range of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  sources that would basically suggest the same. It's true that the new generation has aspirations [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=604.72s)]
*  for more liberalism. But it's interesting that their sentiment towards the U.S. or Western [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=610.88s)]
*  democracies did also make a turn in 2017. And that's during Trump era. So we can't underestimate how [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=618.16s)]
*  the external environment and what's perceived to be greater pressure on China, the kind of [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=625.28s)]
*  idea that somehow the West doesn't want China to become a richer nation, and other developing [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=632.08s)]
*  countries that really do shift their preference, their sentiment, and shape their understandings. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=637.12s)]
*  And so we can't underestimate that as well. So I think we can't take these preferences as given, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=644.72s)]
*  but the external environment, their observations have made them come to a conclusion that maybe [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=650.72s)]
*  the Western democracy doesn't really suit China. You say that some of the reaction [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=657.6s)]
*  that's happened in China against the liberalization that had occurred 20 years ago or so [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=662.32s)]
*  happened out of reaction to Donald Trump, a reaction to what the U.S. did. But to what extent is it [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=668.88s)]
*  Xi Jinping's own values that have changed? And to what extent might China change after he's no [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=675.2800000000001s)]
*  longer in power? Well, the one thing is true is that China has been constantly evolving, adapting, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  and adjusting. And maybe because the West has been so focused on the same three set of issues that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=689.84s)]
*  they have often missed the vast changes and the evolution. And yes, we can maybe say that there [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=694.96s)]
*  are some preferences on the top that are imposed on the general public. But China faces a real [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=703.52s)]
*  challenge. It's no longer the country where the entire population revolves around one goal, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=712.08s)]
*  which is higher income and more GDP. It's becoming a much more complex nation with individual [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=718.64s)]
*  preferences, diverse opinions. And how do you manage a greater complex society is going to be [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=724.8s)]
*  the key critical challenge for the leadership going forward. And it's not going to be easy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=731.36s)]
*  If you look at the youth unemployment rate, 25% of people with bachelor's degree without a job, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=736.0s)]
*  I mean, that is really signaling social instability issues. But also don't underestimate the Chinese [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  government in their rapidity and swift adjustment to policies. In the US, policies take a long time [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=747.04s)]
*  to change, but the parties change. In China, the party doesn't change, but policies can change [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=754.4s)]
*  very quickly. If the government has their mind on something and they believe that's the right thing [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=760.4s)]
*  to do, things will happen swiftly. So never read anything as being permanent, even these rhetoric [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=764.56s)]
*  or the ambitions, the grandiose messages. They're not permanent. They're always recalibrated, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=771.76s)]
*  fine-tuned to fit the circumstances and accommodate the reality. You talk about a 25% [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=777.68s)]
*  unemployment rate among young people, people who have just graduated from college. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=785.2s)]
*  That seems explosive. Why is that happening? Is that a basic economic problem? And what could that mean? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=789.84s)]
*  It is very high, stunningly high, because the world average is around 14.5% [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=797.6s)]
*  of youth unemployment. I think there are some short-term economic reasons. The economy is [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=804.96s)]
*  doing very poorly in China. But I think the more general problem is that diplomas have raced ahead [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=811.0400000000001s)]
*  of the economy. The Chinese economy is still very much manufacturing-based. They don't need that many [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=818.24s)]
*  bachelor degrees, but what they do need is vocational, technical skill training, especially [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=823.36s)]
*  when China aspires to be a giant Germany with this industrial power. At the same time, there's youth [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=829.52s)]
*  unemployment. There's 30 million manufacturing jobs to be filled by 2025, and every year 300,000 [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=836.24s)]
*  skill gap in the semiconductors industry. So it's really a skill education mismatch. And also, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=845.04s)]
*  the big chasm lies in the expectations and reality, the difference between expectations [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=852.08s)]
*  and reality for the youth. They have high expectations. They went to get a college degree, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=858.0s)]
*  and yet they have only jobs as nannies or as a worker in a cigarette manufacturing company. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=863.2s)]
*  And that really leads to disappointment, reduced expectations, and that affects the families as [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=870.32s)]
*  well. And that's a sign, a real sign to be aware of. The Chinese lived under zero COVID [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=877.2s)]
*  policies for I think it was almost three years. And the government seemed to begin to pivot away [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=886.32s)]
*  from that following the protests of the two weeks of protests. How did the COVID zero policy [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=893.5200000000001s)]
*  impact the relationship between the state and the people? And what does it show about the Chinese [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=903.36s)]
*  government that it would really do a pirouette on this issue? I think in the beginning, early [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=908.64s)]
*  stages of the pandemic, the Chinese public were generally supportive of the controls in place and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  saw China as a success. But as we know, as the virus evolved, the policies did not evolve, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=922.72s)]
*  and that became a huge problem. And towards the very end, people were losing jobs. They weren't [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=929.2s)]
*  having any income, and they were pretty much fed up with the lockdowns. And in a very surprising [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  turn, you saw how the people's voices and people's preferences ultimately, you can say it was way too [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=943.84s)]
*  slow, but it did move the government. It did change the government way faster than anyone had [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  expected. And so I think that it is one example of this feedback. And this most important thing is [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=957.6800000000001s)]
*  that the Communist Party, the boat stays afloat because of the sea of people. So that's something [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=965.28s)]
*  that is really important in China. And so they always have to answer to the vast majority, not [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=974.24s)]
*  every single individual Chinese, but the vast majority. And if they're not happy, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=981.12s)]
*  it will topple the boat. So do remember that about China. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=986.4s)]
*  Let me read you a sentence from your book that I found fascinating. You said about China, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=990.48s)]
*  its ambitions do not include exporting its ideology or foisting its development model [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=995.76s)]
*  on the rest of the world. That in some way sets it apart from what we always thought about Russia [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1004.3199999999999s)]
*  for the past whatever, 400 years, that it wanted to spread its ideological models. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1010.08s)]
*  That also is unlike the U.S., which from the days of Woodrow Wilson to the days of George W. Bush [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1017.36s)]
*  and Joe Biden has felt that we're supposed to spread democracy. Do you see that as a fundamental [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1023.36s)]
*  clash? China is more practical. It understands that its unique model is impossible to be replicated [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1030.32s)]
*  elsewhere. So it doesn't strive to do so. But it does also believe that some of the developmental [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1039.2s)]
*  lessons that it can impart on developing countries could be important, for instance, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1044.72s)]
*  like infrastructure development, on which it has a great amount of expertise. But I don't think [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1049.44s)]
*  spreading ideologies is really a goal for China. But this leadership, especially the past generation [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1055.92s)]
*  of leadership, have eminently practical. We have to remember that 80 percent of the global population [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1063.04s)]
*  still lives in developing countries. So China wants to work more with developing countries. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1067.52s)]
*  And I think Chinese technology is eminently more suitable for developing countries than many [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1072.08s)]
*  American or European ones. And you can say that the current leadership is more ideological, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1077.28s)]
*  but it's more internally driven rather than trying to replicate, trying to want to replicate [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1083.92s)]
*  or export some ideals into the rest of the world. K.Yu-jen, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1088.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzy5gpz6-cg&t=1095.04s)]
