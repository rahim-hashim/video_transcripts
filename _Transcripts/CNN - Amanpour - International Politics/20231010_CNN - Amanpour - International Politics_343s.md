Video Description: Israel has been rocked to its core by Hamas’ surprise attack, which has left at least 900 dead, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Palestinian Health Ministry says the death toll in Gaza is now more than 800, with more than 4,000 injured. As the fighting continues, the U.N. calls the latest developments "bone-chilling." Ehud Barak was Israel’s prime minister from 1999 to 2001. Before that he was Israel’s defense minister for nearly six years, first under Ehud Olmert and then for four years under Benjamin Netanyahu. Barak tells Christiane why the Hamas attack was “the most severe blow” in Israel’s “entire existence.”

# Fmr. Israeli Prime Minister: "Hamas [Must] Suffer the Proper Blow" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0)
*  I want to bring in the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, an Army general, former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=0.0s)]
*  head of the armed services, and welcome back to our program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=4.8s)]
*  And it's really good that we have you, because clearly we want to understand from your unique [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  perspective what the next days are going to look like. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=14.88s)]
*  What is the objective for a military incursion or this military response to Hamas in Gaza? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=18.72s)]
*  It was the most severe blow that Israel got all along its existence, a major failure of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=29.68s)]
*  intelligence, of operation, up to the top political leadership. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=38.32s)]
*  And we now have, first of all, to make sure that Hamas will suffer the proper blow that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=43.44s)]
*  it has to get in order that such a repeating such an event will be impossible. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=50.76s)]
*  And it cannot be done without certain risk of widening the circle to the north as well, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=59.4s)]
*  to Hezbollah in the north or to some dormant cells within Judea and Samaria. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=66.84s)]
*  All could happen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=72.88s)]
*  You cannot predict it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=73.88s)]
*  The details of any plan will be decided by details that are not for discussion over the TV. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=75.68s)]
*  Israel is determined to make sure that Hamas will hold accountable to this barbarian murderous attack. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=82.28s)]
*  Ehud Barak, what about the hostages? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=93.28s)]
*  How does that, can you do that simultaneously? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Does one happen to happen first? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=101.2s)]
*  What is that strategy? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  What is that strategy? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=105.16s)]
*  It's a very sensitive issue. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Of course it puts certain constraints on the considerations, but I think that it won't [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  be clever to share these nuances between me and you on TV because we are not the only [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=117.92s)]
*  ones to listen to it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=126.2s)]
*  And I don't think that it could be an issue for discussion. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=128.24s)]
*  So let me ask you what is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=131.96s)]
*  It is a constraint, but we will have to manage it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=133.08s)]
*  So let me ask you then, how likely is it that the hostages survive? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  What do you think is the reason for taking so many hostages? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  What is the strategic reason by Hamas for doing that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=144.8s)]
*  What do they want from you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=147.8s)]
*  It's unprecedented the amount of people that they, you know, their success went much beyond [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=149.72s)]
*  their expectations I believe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  And I think that the objective of course is to get all their prisoners, probably 10,000 [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=160.12s)]
*  of them, in Israeli prisoners to be freed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=166.72s)]
*  And they will try to navigate it toward its end. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=171.2s)]
*  It's not clear how it will end. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=174.76s)]
*  So if it was you, and you know that Israel has entered these very one-sided or lopsided [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  hostage exchanges. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=182.68s)]
*  For one Gilad Shaleed, there were 1,100 or so Palestinians released. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=185.68s)]
*  These are many, many more by a huge factor. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  Would you release all the prisoners in return for these? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=195.72s)]
*  Look, I think first of all that probably one-third of them has also a foreign kind of passport. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=200.68s)]
*  Some of them are really genuine foreigners, like some workers from Thailand. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=211.96s)]
*  Other has American or British or other European or other nations passport. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  I assume that they will be ready to release them under certain terms. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  But even then they will have enough hostages to negotiate very toughly for the release [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  of all their people. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=240.46s)]
*  And I really genuinely I don't think that it will be clever for me to discuss with you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=242.3s)]
*  the tactics. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  I get it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  Fine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  Fine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  I understand. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand what might happen given what did happen in the past. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  But this is, as you say, a different moment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  And Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that, you know, not just to exact revenge and accountability [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=259.38s)]
*  But to change, you know, to totally decapitate, to decimate Hamas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=268.48s)]
*  These are the words we're hearing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  And to, I assume, remove their military and political ability inside Gaza. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=275.8s)]
*  That also is a change because in previous encounters you've left them there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=281.56s)]
*  And now tell me what you think is the end goal regarding them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=287.68s)]
*  Look, Israel already mobilized several hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers deployed [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=293.24s)]
*  all over the area. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=301.04s)]
*  Even if the conflict will widen, I do not, Israel doesn't need it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=302.92s)]
*  And I would not recommend it to the Hezbollah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=307.64s)]
*  But it might quite possibly happen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=310.36s)]
*  Even if we find ourselves fighting against these two fronts, Israel is not under any [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=314.08s)]
*  existential threat. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=320.0s)]
*  Israel will win. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=322.12s)]
*  We know how to unite. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=323.4s)]
*  We know how to fight. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=324.76s)]
*  And we will win. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSWMqr4qAX0&t=326.48s)]
