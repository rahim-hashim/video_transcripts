# Marek Magierowski Russia is Losing This War Right Now  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58)
*  Ambassador, as you know, obviously, there's still hopes for diplomacy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=0.0s)]
*  It hasn't got anywhere yet, but there have been meetings between Russian and Ukrainian [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=4.0s)]
*  delegations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=8.56s)]
*  We saw the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=9.56s)]
*  Nothing came out of it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  But I wonder whether you were struck by an interview that President Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=13.68s)]
*  gave earlier this week to an American network in which he said, and he seemed to put, the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=19.0s)]
*  issue of NATO off the table. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=24.8s)]
*  In other words, saying that he had cooled down to the whole idea. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=26.52s)]
*  He recognized that NATO wasn't coming to the rescue, and therefore, you know, the way [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=30.0s)]
*  he put it was cooling down to the idea or cooling off the idea that NATO was even on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=34.24s)]
*  the agenda for Ukraine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=40.2s)]
*  He talked about needing security guarantees. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=43.28s)]
*  That seemed to be a very big statement from him at this point. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=45.94s)]
*  How did you read it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  It is definitely, and of course, we don't rule out a diplomatic solution to this war, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  but now the ball is in Russia's court, definitely. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=58.64s)]
*  It's them who don't want to negotiate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=62.08s)]
*  It's them who don't seem to be willing to downgrade their expectations and their requests [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=64.52s)]
*  and their demands, which are, many of them are just outlandish, to be honest. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=72.16s)]
*  But again, Poland is in favor of a diplomatic solution, but it's very hard to foresee a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=78.4s)]
*  situation in which Russia would start making serious concessions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=85.72s)]
*  In my humble view, Russia is losing this war right now, not only in the hearts and minds [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=93.6s)]
*  of Europeans and Americans, or the societies of the so-called free world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=100.08s)]
*  Russia is losing this war literally. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  So I believe that many of those families who have fled Ukraine, mostly to Poland, will [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=108.28s)]
*  be able to return to their homes shortly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know whether we will find a diplomatic solution, but maybe the military solution. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=117.84s)]
*  And defeating the Russian army in Ukraine is the way out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=123.76s)]
*  OK, well, Ambassador, that is very bold talk, defeating the Russian army. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=128.72s)]
*  That's exactly what NATO says it doesn't want to do, which is exactly the conundrum you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  all got embroiled in, yourselves as Poland and the United States, over the issue of fighter [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=137.88s)]
*  jets. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  The Polish government has been very adamant on this issue. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  We should not engage in a direct military confrontation with Russia. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=149.55999999999997s)]
*  That's why what I am saying is that I believe that the Ukrainian army is capable of defeating [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  the Russian army right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW03m5UaF58&t=158.76s)]
