# Sen. Hollen: Russia's Invasion Will Be Seen as a "Strategic Failure by Putin" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - International Politics:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8)
*  Here now is Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a Democrat from Maryland. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=2.0s)]
*  Senator, welcome to the program. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=3.84s)]
*  You may have just heard the former Deputy Commander of NATO [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  saying that all of this unity is really impressive, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=9.68s)]
*  the U.S. gathering, this global coalition as well, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=12.6s)]
*  but it also has to be matched by U.S. power [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=16.04s)]
*  in terms of defending Ukraine [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=19.12s)]
*  and really putting a wall of steel [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=21.04s)]
*  against what might be a new border in Europe. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=24.66s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=27.36s)]
*  Well, Christiane, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=30.16s)]
*  As you said, President Biden last night [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=31.9s)]
*  spoke on behalf of all Americans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=34.26s)]
*  who were inspired by the Ukrainian people standing up, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=36.7s)]
*  and we're going to be matching the rhetoric [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=40.08s)]
*  with redeployments, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=44.08s)]
*  reinforcements of NATO's flank, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  especially the frontline states that's already started, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  where U.S. forces have been deployed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  And we expect here in Congress [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=54.72s)]
*  to pass approximately an $8 billion emergency supplemental [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=57.32s)]
*  to both support the humanitarian effort [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=62.86s)]
*  but also the continued arming of the Ukrainian military [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=64.86s)]
*  in the coming days. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=69.06s)]
*  What can you tell us, if you can, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=71.36s)]
*  about what you may have been briefed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=73.36s)]
*  on the current battleground situation? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  Well, I can speak to what's been in the public domain, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=80.34s)]
*  and as you know, that's been reflecting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=83.64s)]
*  the views of our military, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=87.6s)]
*  even before the invasion started. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=88.92s)]
*  They did a very good job [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=92.36s)]
*  of getting the intelligence out there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=93.46s)]
*  It gave us the time to work with our European allies [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=95.64s)]
*  in advance to get ready and impose the sanctions, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=98.34s)]
*  the punishing sanctions. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  Look, I think we all believe that Putin [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=103.1s)]
*  thought that he'd be able to march much more quickly [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=107.28s)]
*  into Ukraine, into Kiev. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  He's certainly been slowed down dramatically. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=113.02s)]
*  The Ukrainian resistance has been huge and inspiring. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=116.08s)]
*  And at the same time, of course, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=120.54s)]
*  he has overwhelming massive firepower and troops. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=123.12s)]
*  So who knows exactly how this will unfold? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=130.12s)]
*  But I think what we do know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=133.66s)]
*  as your earlier guest was just saying, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=135.56s)]
*  is that in the long run, Putin's not going to be able [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=138.16s)]
*  to hold out and occupy Ukraine [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=141.1s)]
*  and cities like Kiev, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  because you've got 44 million Ukrainians [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  who don't want Putin there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  And in the long run, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=153.0s)]
*  this will be seen as an epic miscalculation, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=154.73999999999998s)]
*  a strategic failure by Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=158.28s)]
*  We need to do everything we can right now [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=160.78s)]
*  and in a sustained way to make sure that happens. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=163.38s)]
*  We're doing this, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=166.22s)]
*  we're taking the steps necessary now, I believe. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAZuxyQqnO8&t=167.48s)]
